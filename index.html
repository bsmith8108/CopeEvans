	    <h1>The Collection</h1>
	    <div class="transparent">
	    <p>The Cope Evans Family Papers contain the letters of the 
	    closely related Quaker families of Cope and Evans who lived
	    in Germantown, Pennsylvania.  The letters in the collection
	    were written between 1732-1911.  They discuss family, 
	    friends and home life, and reflect the social environment 
	    of these Quaker families.  Other topics to be found within 
	    the letters include Philadelphia history, Haverford history
	    , travels in Europe, education, illness and death, and 
	    discussions of national events such as the Civil War, 
	    Reconstruction, and the assassinations of Presidents 
	    Lincoln and McKinley.  They are a rich source of 
	    information on a large number of topics
	    (<i>Haverford Special Collections</i>).</p>

	    <p><em>Abstract:</em>   Written accounts and data 
	    visualizations of materials from members of the Cope-Evans 
	    Family provide evidence in a transgenerational study into 
	    the experience of Quaker thought and practice on education,
	    travel, and public works during this transformation. 
	    Individual actors in these narratives contribute insight 
	    on their generationâ€™s role in the evolution of Quakerism 
	    from a sheltered religion, to a religion conflicted and 
	    mediated by internal debates, to ultimately a cosmopolitan
	    religion that observes spiritual gain in exploration of 
	    worldly knowledge by appropriately assigning importance 
	    to modern education, extensive foreign and domestic travel,
	    and public work that supports these new globalizing values.

	    <h1>The Industrial Age</h1>
	    <div class="transparent">
            <p>The Industrial Age was a time of cultural expansion and diffusion through intensifying interconnections, which were not only aided by developments in new systems of transit, but also a result of new values placed on travel. The tectonic nature of such a period so exceptionally different from its predecessor is likely to produce a historic revolution.</p>

	    <h1>Quakers in the Industrial Age</h1>
	    <div class="transparent">
            <p>During that unique moment, outward pressures were heavily imposed on the Quaker religion to secularize and culturally assimilate to the increasingly heterogeneous culture of this period. The anachronistic lifestyle and quietism of traditional Quakers directly opposed the modern lifestyles of liberal Quakers, and in effect forced a series of revolutionary separations. These rigid divisions, first seen in the 1827 Separation of Orthodox and Hicksite, and then again in the splintering of the Orthodox faction into the Wilburite and Gurneyites sects, were motivated by a desire to define the Quaker religion to a corresponding lifestyle that mirrored an interpretation of how Quakers ought to participate with God, themselves, and the world around them.  </p>

            <p>
transition : The increasing interconnectivity and demand on Quakers to engage in the world during the Industrial Age challenged previous tenets of guarded education and cloistered communities, marshalling a transformation that not only changed Quaker values, but fundamentally changed how Quakerism is experienced. </p>
