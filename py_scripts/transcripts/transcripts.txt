Title: 1867 August 18 and 20, Newport, to Father

Newport, 8th mo., 18th. 1867.

Dear Father
I   thought I would write to thee this afternoon, in case I   should not get a chance before the steamer leaves.  Not that   I’m so very busy, but since I lie down every noon when I get   home from bathing in time, and in the evenings we have Mary   Williams’ lamp incased in the same little plain bonnet so   that we have no chance either to write or read after dark,   unless we take a lamp and go up stairs.  
On 6th day we   ordered the boat, but were not able to go out, on account of   the rain.  In the morning Alfred had the pleasure of   witnessing a little sail boat upset, the man who was in it   managed to get on the bottom untill a sail boat came to his   assistance.  In the afternoon the rain slackened some and we   made up quite a large party and hired the omnibus to go to   the south Shore and see if the horn spouted, we had George   and thecarriage beside.  When we got there the horn did not spout   at all, but the waves were very fine, and towards the latter   part of the time, when the sun came out, very beautiful the   sun shone on the spray making nearly half of a rainbow.  We   staid till quite late stopping on the way home at the   boathouse, the sea there was not nearly so fine though.  On   seventh day morning we made up a small fishing expedition,   consisting of Alf, Hazen, Tom Longstreth, George and myself.   We went about a mile above the poor house anchoring in a   little cove near the rail-road.  We had quite good luck, and   caught about 24 fish, including 2 star fish, several   Chaucksus, and one very fat eel, which I had the   gratification of catching.  Since we have been here we have   seen two very curious fish, one called an “old maid,” which   is about 1 foot long and white underneath; the other is a   “swell fish,” and looks very much like other fish, except   when you turn it over and rub it gentlyit becomes inflated and is puffed out like a small   air-baloon, it is about 6 inches long.  The fishermen on the   point have had a reading room and small library established   for their benefit in a back room looking out on the bay at   “Godderds,” (I don[t] know whether I have spelt it right or   not, but if thee pronounces it the way its spelt thee will   know where I mean) by a Miss or Mrs. Gibbs.  They take the   daily and some of the illustrated papers, and I noticed a   number of the “British Gardiner” I think it was on the   table.  Well to come to the point at once; uncle Harry was   invited to deliver a sort of a lecture to them on last 6th   day evening.  George Merrit seemed very desirous that the   ladies would come up and hear the discourse, which some of   them did.  The speech was very grand the subject being   “Water,” I dont know whether the fishermen properly   appreciated it, since I heard one remark afterwards that,   “it wouldtake a purty smart man to follow him.”  I believe uncle   Harry proposes to deliver some more during this week on   Light and Air.  20th 3rd day.  Yesterday we took a sail over   to the Dumplings and landed those that wanted to, the rest   of us going on down, towards Bever Tail.  This morning we   proposed sailing around Canonicut, recruits came in slowly   since they had been all finished by the expedition to the   Light ship, however as it turned out there was not enough   wind and we had to defer it untill tomorrow, and go bathing   instead.  This afternoon mother contemplates going sailing   if George thinks we are not going to have a squall; at   present it looks very much like rain.  I suppose Mother has   told thee all about the storm they have been having at home.   I hope we’ll not have it here.  And now since I have used up   my sheet I will stop.  affecty thy son

Awbury –
April 2.nd.

Dearest Lilly –
I don’t   know what thee has thought of me for not thanking thee   before for thy Most generous Contribution to our Collection   for the Colored Summer Home –  it came on the day of the   evening when Jonnie was stricken. & I forgot about it   entirely until the following Tuesday, the day of our   Collection, & I should have sat downright then & written. but Anna was writing to thee & I sent   a message. & thought I would wait until I had more time to   write a longer letter.  but that time has scarce seemed to   come until now!  We have just finished dining at Mother’s –   & while Mother is engaged in her usual occupation with the   dishes in the pantry. I had sat down in the library with Tom   & Will who are both reading. to write to thee.  Anna was so   long ingetting her letter off to thee.  I imagine the Contents told   everything up to within a day or two –  Chellie is very   wonderful,– perfectly calm & like herself –  but she looks   badly – & I fear as the days go on & she realizes more &   more what has happened. that she will show it even more –   but she is blessed with four devoted Sons who are looking   after her in every way –  Miss Richardson of Course, as thee   knows is with them – & they kept theNurse, whom they had for Jonnie, until yesterday.  Anna too   keeps well. & so far is entirely natural – but Miss   Richardson watches her like a hawk. & never lets her be   alone long – they want her to go away.– but she does not   want to.– & Miss R. told me yesterday that they would not   insist upon it – which I am glad of – for I think we cannot   always judge what is best for others at these   times.
Mother, I am thankfulto say, is very well – & with Anna & my being here   alternately she has gotten along very well with the new maid   whom Anna got for her – but of course she is not a Companion   – or a trained nurse – and I think we are going to be able   to get Susan Stewart out next week for a few weeks until she   (Susan) goes to the Hospital –  We may be able to keep her   until Mother goes to North East, but thatI Cannot say –  Chellie was in hopes that Mother would   [heed] this nurse who has been with her this week.  & if she   liked her to have her go to Northeast with her.  but Mother   was strongly opposed to it –  I think largely because she   was a stranger – now we had proposed Miss Moses’ name.  &   she wants her –  So I expect she will be gotten –  I had had   a talk with her. & she is entirely willing to undertake it   if she is wanted. & both Mother & Tomseem to want it – tho’ Tom says he wants nothing except what   Mother wants –  The trouble is about Miss Moses she will   have to [leave] Mother to be home by the first of October –    I am quite sure she will be a very devoted nurse – and I   think it will be very hard for Mother to let her go –  I   only wish we could get a permanency –  Before Jonnie died   Miss R. had told Mother that she would come back to her in   the fall. & I think Mother ishoping for that –  but I feel that is not to be counted   upon.
Please forgive such a lenghty epistle –  Mother has   now returned from the pantry – the men have departed & I   must say goodbye to thee –
Please give my love to Ellie &   much for thyself –
from thy loving sister

Title: 1867 August 26, Newport, to father

Newport 8th. mo. 26th. 1867.

Dear father
I rec’d   thy letter 5th day morning.  Thy accounts quite make me wish   to see England some time although I dont know that that time   will ever come.  On 4th day we sailed round Canonicut, and   since Lilly says she has given thee a condensed account of   our trip, I will copy our log by way of variety.  The   officers were: Capt. Geo. F Merritt, 1st mate T.P. Cope Jr   2nd mate A Cope Jr; Seaman T.K. Longstreth, Cabin boy F.H.   Cope.  Steward M. C Collins.  Cook V. Hartshorne and 6   passengers, A Newhall, M Newhall, M Farnum, H Carter, M.   Collins, & E.S. Cope.
Log of the Canonicut Party – Yacht   “TCope [Deferred]”
(Rations limited)
Started from the   pier at 8 1/2, A.M., arrived at the lighthouse at 8.40.   there met M.C. Cope and party in a row boat, who wished us   joy,and desired us to report all new discoveries; soon after we   commenced telling fortunes.  2 m. of 9 o’clock saw a   porpoise on the starboard side.  9.22. off fort Adams,   weather, calm, thin canopy of clouds, at this moment it was   proposed to “put more steam on.”  Three persons forward of   the “Lobster Box.”  progress, “slow but awfully sure.”  10.   o’clock, interesting information concerning the compass, by   Capt. Merritt.  surf seen at Bever Tail, fears entertained   for the health of the party.  Some excitement caused by the   appearance of two fish, which produced restlessness on the   part of the cabin boy –  10.11. opposite the Dumplings.  11   o’clock opposite Castle Hill the game of quintettes played   with interest by the 1st mate, cook, and several of the   passengers; the steward seiged with headache – at this time   doubts were expressed by the captain as to the probability   of the winds changing before 6 P.M. weather still calm.  [8]   m after 11. met a sailing vessel commanded by captain Henry   Merritt, rowed by the capt. and sculled by Henry Merritt jr   who hailed us, and threw a small lobster into the boat one   of the passengers was badly bitten which caused great   excitement untill she was rescued from the jaws of the   carnivorous creature.  11 1/2 A.M. Slight windthe South and visible, stood off to welcome it.  Party   regaled themselves with rations. 12. M. South wind   continues.  candy handed.  Met a schooner and were saluted   by a dog on board.  Long swells, health good.  12.10.   conversation on the weather prohibited– a number of the   passengers retired to rest – Cabin boy reclining on a   passenger–  cook on the dinner basket–  1st mate absorbed in   a book.  12.45. Point Judith lighthouse in sight.  After   serious consideration it was decided to pursue our journey   on which account three cheers were given.  12.50. Passing   Bever Tail.  three more cheers – passengers happy – saluted   by the horn and a towel was waved to us, which compliment   was returned passengers waving handkerchiefs.  2. P.M.   Dinner – great dispute on the subject of ringing the   triangle.  2.45. from “Lobster Box” end–  dinner   accomplished satisfactorily leaving the voyagers in a   quiescent state of mind–  dinner consisted of 9 courses   closed with sour-drops–  opposite M. Williams’- Bay   comparatively speaking very rough!  Fast passing Wickford –   Slight excitement Fortunes being told again aft. The 1st   mate has just restored the cabin to order, after dinner.    Aft becoming very impudent.  Bow hair dressing.  1st matesweeping and thereby discomboberating all – 2.55. Patience   in sight.  sentiment in the bow, 3.12. Approaching the end   of Canonicut Greenwich off the larboard bow.  Patience and   Rocky Pt. ahead.  the breeze delightful, and all of the   party very comfortable, some reading, some working zephyr   work.  3.20. Rounding the north end of Canonicut.  Three   cheers given by all the party.  3.35. P.M. Rounding   Canonicut.  Newport in view – on our homeward trip – breeze   good.  some of the party wishing to land we are going to (we   did’nt) 3.38. Met the Providence steamboat- Needless anxiety   on the part of the passengers.  Now dashing gaily towards   Newport.  3.55 Proceeding fondly – just played games of   authors and consequences.  3 m. of 5.P.M. off the   Lighthouse. health good.  Fine breeze- Band tuning up for a   song before we reach the pier.  Arrived at the pier at   5.P.M.  On first day evening we took a walk to Tammany Hill.   we started after a 6 o’clock tea but were not able to get   there untill dark or dusk.  It is the first time I was ever   there.  We saw the lights at Point Judith, the Light Ship,   Bever Tail and the Break water.  Yesterday was splendidlyclear.  In the morning we took a short float, I cant call it   a sail there wasn’t any wind, after which we went bathing.    In the afternoon I made up a small sailing party consisting   of Alice Carter, Abby Newhall, Tom Longstreth and Alfred, we   went out to the Dumplings and landed, & afterwards came back   to take Caroline Mary her first sail.  She could’nt have had   a more pleasant evening it neither too cold nor too warm, &   there was a splendid breeze.  We went around Rose Island and   got back in good season.  though not strictly obeying her   mothers instructions about being home at half past 6.  This   morning we went bathing as usual and also engaged the boat,   Alfred preferring to go to Coddingtons Cove to bathing.    Thee will observe that I’ve been getting about as much good   out of boating as possible this season.  Since we arrived   Alf has become a staunch friend of Geo. Merritt’s and Hazen   of Geo. Barlow’s. Its quite remarkable how devoted Alf is,   he spends the big parts of his time at the reading room with   George.  This morning I got a new key fitted, formy valise, having lost the other since my arrival.  We were   not able to mail these letters in time to go by the [La---]   so they will have to take their chance by going via New   York.  There are 24 folks going to Philadelphia the night we   go, which will make a pretty effectual change in Mary   Williams’ boarders, and there will be no one left but Tom   Longstreth to do the honors of the occasion.  We are rather   puzzled as to what to do if we were left by the 7 o’clock   train from New York, since the 10 o’clock train has been   taken off the line.  We will have to run the risk, I   suppose, of getting the 8.40, Washington train, stopped at   Frankford.  Having run out of news and since mother is also   writing I will stop.
affecty thy son

Fourth day night

Dear   Nanny,

Its frightfully late, and if I say so--thee   may be sure it is late; my eyelids have told me so sometime   since, and bed, over yonder, looks wonderous inviting--but   remembering Uncle's last injunction to write-- I begin forth   with, though thee must'nt expect much from sleepy folks--I   only am going to deliver Uncles message, which I have tried   to remember and transcribe exactly in his words-- "We only   desired thy return with Edward Biddle, thinking thee might   not have another opportunity for some time, if thee chooses   to run the risk of another escort do so--" I have just been   repeating this to Cousin Frank & he says, oh tell Anna there   will be some way of her getting home and to stay longer, if   she wishes it--We
do not want thee at home till thee gets better--and get   along pretty well without thee, I don't suppose Aunt Rachel   fares quite so well as if thee were here--but I do try to do   my best--Cousin Elizbt's letter of last eving told thee she   was'nt quite well--she is some better to-day--and I hope   tomorrow will be better still--(Oh my! There--I've actually   fallen asleep over my letter--thee wont feel much   complimented I'm afraid) Tell Clemmy we got her first   letter--and think we are very remiss not to have   ex[patiated] on its sweetness for [-]
Wellm [--rsis]   Mother is on--some of us have called upon her yet--somebody   must tomorrow, as she returns home Seventh day.
George   sends his love--and I expect the folks generally would,
I forgot to ask them--
Farewell--I'm so dreadfully   sleepy--thine Julie--

Oh my! I must wake up and tell   thee we got letters this afternoon--Cos Thos expected to   start in a sailing vessel from Havre on the 24 or 26th--So   he's on the ocean now--tossing about--Poor fellow! Frank was   travelling about in Scotland when last heard from, and   cousin Thos has advised him to return in a steamer thinking   he could not reach Havre time enough to sail with   him--Is'ent this too bad--to come home this way,   piece-meal--Cos Thos seems real blue--but rejoicing at the   thoughts of home. he cannot be here before 30 days, Uncle   says,
what a long time to wait--Is'ent it-- The [----] of love to   Clemmy and Aunt Susan--and all the rest--tell the two former   I hope they are attending to their [-obes]--the 29th is most   here--and they're both going to have written   invitations--they're names are down on the list--but the   invitations are not written yet--
Anna thee must come   home prepared to be very bright, and help me to remember my   friends those to whom I must send cards--Cousin John thinks   he cannot have his children now--tho he would like to go up   for thee very well, if they [---] well--They are very   restless at nights--We expect Uncle Edward 6th or 7th   day.--

Laurel House
7th mo. 28th. 1867.

Dear Father
Lilly and Chelly having been keeping up such an active correspondence by the last two steamers, I thought I would reserve my efforts untill they had got through. 
We received a letter from uncle Tom inclosing a letter from thee informing us of the loss of thy masticators, it      would have been remarkably unfortunate if thee had not had      an extra set with thee.  I hope by this time thee is      enjoying thyself on terra firma, but since the difference of      time between where thee is and where we are is so great, we      find it hard to guess what thee is about.  We received letters from home last night, dated the 25th., saying they   were all well and preparing to leave for Newport on 5th day.   Mother had also received a letter from thee mailed at   Halifax
On last 6th day we rode to Stony Clove, an   entirely new place to me, about 10 miles distant.  The road   is quite rough, and runs between two mountains, one of which   rises almost perpendicularly about 1000 ft, as near as we   could judge, and on each side there are large rocks under   which we found ice: they say the sun never gets there and   the ice under the rocks never melts during the summer.  On   approaching this place the air becomes perceptably cooler   and on leaving it becomes warm again.  We took dinner at a   little farm house and although it was plain weenjoyed it very much.  After dinner we had to leave right   away for home.  Going back we had a splendid view of those   distant mountains you see on your way to the Plauterkill   Clove.
Yesterday morning we, that is Tom Stokes, Harry,   some other gentlemen and myself, walked down to Bastion   Falls to take a bath, thee remembers what a fine basin there   is at the foot of the falls, well it was there we went in;   the water was pretty cool on first going in but after we had   been in a little while, and had kicked around a good bit we   got quite warm and all in a glow.  We went under the fall   where it hit the rocks for a second time, but even there the   water stung like hail-stones, and I preferredthe pool to getting such a warming as that.  In the      afternoon we walked over to the Mountain House to see the      view, on starting it was beautifully clear but when we had      gone about half way, two clouds, very considerately, came      rolling down upon us, one from North and one from South      mountain, and by the time we got to the precipice both the      view and ourselves were completely mistified; we accordingly      went into the House and got weighed, and since thee will not      object to hearing how much some of the members of thy      immediate family weigh, I will give thee part of the      table:
R.R.C.  125 lbs.   E.S.C.  98 lbs.   T.P.C.  90      lbs.     Rachel has gained 7 lbs. since last sum- mer, and its becoming quite dreadful; I'm afraid, if she      goes on gaining, we will be obliged to have her put up in a      barrel and roll her home from Newport.  Tom Stokes, Ellie,      Madjie, and Walter are going home tomorrow morning: the rest      of us expect to leave here fourth day and go to Albany, we      will stay there that night, and go to Boston the next day;      leaving Boston 6th. day afternoon we will arrive at Newport      in time for tea.  I suppose mother has told thee that she      succeeded in engaging both the Georges during our stay      there.  The weather here has been very warm and showery; to      day it is very pleasant but it has been so very showery we      were afraid to try going to walk. Aunt Lizzie received two letters from the Adirondacks to      day one from cousin Clemmy and one from aunt Annie, giving      an account of a trip which they had taken to lake Placid by      the way of John Brown's grave; aunt Annie said the grave was      very plain, there was a tombstone with some engraving on it      and on a boulder nearby was the plain inscription "John      Brown - 1859."  She also said cousin Clemmy was a good deal      stronger and was able to bear fatigue as well as the rest of      them  They were both very much surprised to hear of thy      sudden leaving for England.  Lilly and Chelly send their      love.  We are all well and have had a most splendid time      considering that our "pa" is on the other side of the Atlantic and now having given thee   all the news I can remember I will   stop.
affectionately
thy son Thos P. Cope Jr

Rachel DrinkerDear Cousins

Our dear Grandmother is Kind enough to   permit me to add a few lines to her letter–  I wish it was   in my power to communicate to you something that would   afford pleasure.  But alas!  I have lived to see the   melancholy period that death has seperated from me one of   the best of mothers, whose affection I believe I possessed;   and that I loved her with sincere affection, affords me no   small share of consolation–  She suffered much during her   illness, but such was her Christian fortitude that she never   discovered the least impatience, and constantly maintained   her usual cheerful serenity of mind, which was her   characteristic through a life of trials.  It was painful to   see her suffer so much bodily pain, but infinitly more so to   see her breath her last, a[l]though she suffered not the   pangs of death, but passed from this terrestrial world to   one where peace, happiness and pleasure reign triumphantly;   and where she now enjoys the blissful harvest of a spotless   and well spent life–  Such has been the immutable decree of   heaven to deprive me of an affectionate Mother and you an   affectionate Aunt– We are still blest with having our dear   Grandmother to cheer us–  She enjoysher usual health, which I hope she may enjoy for years to   come–
The last letter we received from Arthur states that   he and Cousin Henry are both well, and expect to leave the   West Indies very shortly; we of course expect them   daily–
Uncle is at present in good health, and I hope   will long continue so; here I must close this short epistle   and hope that I will see you before long –  I remain your   affectionate

I want very much to see you, I hope you   will come and pay us a visit, I am still Favoured with   Health, and that you may enjoy that Blessing is the Desire   of your affectinate Grandmother
Rachel DrinkerDear Cousins

Our dear Grandmother is Kind enough to   permit me to add a few lines to her letter–  I wish it was   in my power to communicate to you something that would   afford pleasure.  But alas!  I have lived to see the   melancholy period that death has seperated from me one of   the best of mothers, whose affection I believe I possessed;   and that I loved her with sincere affection, affords me no   small share of consolation–  She suffered much during her   illness, but such was her Christian fortitude that she never   discovered the least impatience, and constantly maintained   her usual cheerful serenity of mind, which was her   characteristic through a life of trials.  It was painful to   see her suffer so much bodily pain, but infinitly more so to   see her breath her last, a[l]though she suffered not the   pangs of death, but passed from this terrestrial world to   one where peace, happiness and pleasure reign triumphantly;   and where she now enjoys the blissful harvest of a spotless   and well spent life–  Such has been the immutable decree of   heaven to deprive me of an affectionate Mother and you an   affectionate Aunt– We are still blest with having our dear   Grandmother to cheer us–  She enjoysher usual health, which I hope she may enjoy for years to   come–
The last letter we received from Arthur states that   he and Cousin Henry are both well, and expect to leave the   West Indies very shortly; we of course expect them   daily–
Uncle is at present in good health, and I hope   will long continue so; here I must close this short epistle   and hope that I will see you before long –  I remain your   affectionate
cousin

Str. “Dalmatia”, Oct. 28, 1911.

Dear Alg,

I   meant or wanted to write to thee sooner, but thought I would   wait until we were really touching Palestine. I have my map   at hand in the case which thee presented me, and I think it   is going to be fine. So far nothing is blocking our plans –   neithercholera nor fanaticism aroused by war – and we are due at   Beirut tomorrow to go on to Damascus and take a two or three   weeks’ trip across country to Hermon, Galilee, and Samaria,   and so down to Jerusalem. To-day we have been looking, from   our ship, up at nothing less than Mount Carmel. Haifa as   thee knows is built at its foot and is of course very   picturesque. Part of the mountain’s sides is bare and brown,   rather, but part is covered with small trees, carob and oak,   I believe, which isa very pretty sight. Six or seven miles up the coast we can   see Acre with all its crusading associations. And as we have   been thinking of some of the associations of Mount Carmel it   is of course intensely interesting. I have a fine pair of   number eight binoculars which add to our enjoyment   greatly.

Nat Groton and I get along very well. He is   very patient with me; my awkwardness and unnecessary anxiety   in giving fees must be a great source of trial tohim, but he bears it well. With all these fellows coming   after you and towards you and around you for “bakshish” all   the time, it is very trying sometimes. Yesterday I had my   first – and I hope my last, as it is not pleasant –   experience of being cursed up and down and out and out by   one of the fellows who brought us out again to the Steamer   from Jaffa, for giving too little bakshish.

We went   ashore forpart of the day yesterday at Jaffa, or Joppa, which was   our first contact with Palestine. It was not calculated to   be sentimental. The disembarking is not easy, for there is   no harbor, and the rowboats are hard to get into from the   steamer. As I stepped down, the boat happened to sink in the   trough of a wave and I had the queer feeling of stepping   down into space.We were rowed in in a pelting rain, too, which made the   little streets of Joppa literally inches deep with – not   mud, but filth. The old tomb of Tabitha was only discovered   recently, but is old. The “house of Simon the tanner” may   well have been in a different place from the one which is   shown you. But after you think it over, these things make no   difference. It is Joppa. And the tanner’s house was just the   sort of one which is shown, and hisbusiness was a tannery, I suppose to make leather bottles   for water and wine. His house no doubt opened out on unclean   courts, and he was contaminated in Jewish eyes by touching   dead animals, swine at that. So where was a better place   than such a little house, with its unclean factory in the   midst and its flat roof looking out to sea and its host none   the less hospitable for any of these things, for Peter to be   prepared for his wonderful vision? And in this needy, little   town Tabitha did live. And thesame intensely interesting, picturesque life goes on its   crooked, little streets and alleys to-day. We saw a man   sitting, grinding meal between an upper and a lower   mill-stone, small ones, the upper of which he turned by   hand. We squeezed by long strings of camels, and walked   through swarms of turbaned Arabs. There are lots of other   interesting things in Joppa which stay with you in spite of   the filth through which  you wade, and the variegated odors   which assail your nostrils, but I must stop now. Please give   my love to thy mother, and Anna, and Harold, and my kind   remembrances to Miss Richardson, and if I may still trouble   thee, much love to Jac and Ed, and thyself

from Joe.

Dear Cousins,

By the permission of grandmother, I   take this opportunity of indulging myself in writing a few   line to you, which I should have done previous to this and   in a more particular manner, but my time has been pretty   generally occupied; and as my health has not for this some   time past been as good as formerly, I have not given so much   attention to my promise of writing to you as I otherwise   should have done –  The City in general is unusually   healthy, which I hope is not a presage to any malignant   fever: The weather is not at present very favourable after   so much rain, it is too warm–
Arthur I expect will sail   in a few days for St Thomas’s, where he intends selling   vessel and cargo, the sale of the former will depend upon   the price she will bring –  The voyage will be attended with   less danger than the former one to Cape Francois; they will   be liable it is true, to be taken by the English and French,   by the former because the port is a French one, by the   latter because they had been to the Cape; however if they   are careful to avoid all vessels in due time and conceal the   name of the sloop and her having been to Hayti they will   escapebeing captured–  The Sloop sails very fast [and] will in all   probability reach the port without any accident from man;   the fast sailing of the vessel will not quell a storm: then   thay must use their skill, do what lies in their power and   not be dismayed–
One would almost be induced to suppose   that nothing new or strange can take place, that every thing   that is extraordinary has past, and that the mine of wonder   is exhausted, for there is nothing but a series of old   occurrences revolving upon the face of the inhabitable and   navigable world–  Here I must resign my pen, and close this   uninteresting scrawl, with wishing you the blessing of   health and happiness –
I remain your affectionate   cousin

1st day eve

My dear   Mother

I had to leave off writing very suddenly last   time, as thee must have seen by the letter having no   direction.  We got to writing in bed at West Point as we   woke up early, & were not going to take breakfast till 8   1/2; but we had to go at 9 1/2, & as we were very pokey we   did not get down to breakfast till 9 o’clock-hence my great   hurry.  We left West P. in the boat, the rest of the way up   the Hudson was not however nearly so interesting, we soon   got out of the Highlands & then it seemed very tame.  This   is the most magnificent place we were ever, or are likely   ever, to be in; The view from the front of the house is very   extencive & beautifulfrom one place we can see the top of Mount Washington with   the opera glass.  The house is quite a large one tho’ mostly   old fashioned except the parlor wh. is up stairs, & has I   think most probably been altered the passages are the most   intricate I ever was in, & sometimes I feel completely lost.   We are on the very top of the mountain with dreadful   prespicise’s all around us, & it is the most dreadful place   to get up to that ever was, thee knows its a twelve miles   drive up the mountain from the landing, & how long does thee   ’spose we were getting up? 5 1/2 hours- just think of it the   horses walked nearly all the way, & stoped ever few   minut[e]s to rest; after we got fairly to the foot of the   mountain within about three miles from the house father &   Tom got out to walk, “& the consequence was” they got here   an hour & a quarter before us.the last part of the way poor Rach, was dreadfully sick, the   boat & stage together were too much for her, & as soon as we   got there I helped her get right to bed, she slept pretty   well however after she once did get to sleep tho’ she   suffered dreadfully poor child, thee knows her headaches are   so hard to bear, but don’t worry she’s quite well to day.    This morning they had service in the parlor to wh. Cous.   Clem, Chell & I went with papa’s leave. the sermon was   pretty good & I must confess I think it much better that   poking round all 1st day & going no where, if you can’t go   to meeting go to church – “thems my sentiments.”  After   service we all went out to take a ramble & after a good deal   of hunting round for paths & scrambling up them when found,   we at last arrivedat the top of South Mountain It was a beautiful walk   although it seemed to scare poor aunt Annie terribly to see   us so near the edge of these awful prespicise’s wh. surround   us every where; the rocks covered with ferns, mosses,   litgens are really beautiful.  We passed through what they   call “[Pudding]–stone Hall” a large cleft in the rocks   formed of pudding–stone & also through the lemon-squeezers   another crevise.  We are altogether enjoying ourselves very   much I think & propose staying here till 3rd day afternoon   when we will probably leave for Saratog[a], & thence to Lake   George.  at least those are present prospects but as we have   changed our plans several times to day I wont say certainly,   if we p[u]rsue the plan now proposed wewill stop at Belloes Falls on our way to Boston & spend   next 1st day at Nahant if we can.

Paris 3rd Month 14th 1840
My Dear Cousin
I suppose you   have through the medium of letters to some of our family   heard of us and our safe arrival in Europe, but in   compliance with thy request and my promise which has not   been forgotten, I thought (altho at a late period) a breif   sketch of our [pastimes] in our new location would be   acceptable hoping that you retain a feeling of interest in   our welfare.  We arrived in London after a short and   altogather pleasant voyage passed ten day’s there was   buisily engaged in visiting the many objects very   interesting to strangers, the Tower, Westminster Abbey, St   Paul’s, House of Lords, and various other places, We then   left; after a travel of four days thro an interesting   country we arrived at Paris, during which time we were all   favoured with health, and our children were very good   scarcely uttering a word of complaint of fatigue or any   thing else, this thee may well suppose enhanced our   pleasure, or at least diminished our difficulties, When we   arrived in Paris, we took posession of apartments engaged   for our reception in a French family who speak English,  the   family consists of this and five American families, who form   a pleasant domestic circle, they are all plainly disposed   people, some very interesting a Doctor Lowell with his wife   and daughter who have visited most of the countries of   Europe, Egypt, Palestine, are with us, English is spoken at   our table, this altho very pleasant retards our progress in   the acquisition of the french language,
We are situated   in Rue de Rivoli opposite theTuileries the garden annexed to the palace, the residence of   the royal family, our location is very pleasant, excepting   that we are in the fourth story of the house (this in   America would not be considered respectable) not so in Paris   the population is so great; that highly respectable and even   wealthy families occupy apartments, consisting of several   rooms on a level, so that a house (of course large) will   accommodate many families, a very small proportion of   residents occupying a house as we do in America, this I felt   to be a great abridgment of my domestic comfort
My   ignorance of the language and the uncertainty of our   continuance induces us to board, I do not wish to encumber   myself with domestic cares, for the management of a family   in Paris is attended by much care, for one who would not   choose to leave every thing to the regulation of servants,    There are several hundred Americans in Paris who form a   pleasant society, it is customary here for those who keep   house to set apart one evening in the week for the reception   of their freinds, who receive an invitation to visit them on   that evening whenever inclination dictates, this promotes   great sociability among those who meet, the simplicity of   the entertainment is to be admired, consisting generally of   a cup of tea and cake only, very seldom serving any other   refreshment, in other respects not so simple, as a great   regard is paid to personal appearance, Dress, Dress, seems   to engross their minds to the exclusion of other and better   considerations,
Our two daughters are at a school of high   repute and we think deservedly so, they are improving in   their studies,We have visited several churches, Catholic and protestant    This we feel to be a very great privation, to have no place   of worship to resort to in accordance with our own views   where we could commune with our own hearts and be still, but   we feel the necessity of recurring to the dictates of that   inward guide, which if obey’d will lead out of all error,    We have visited a great many of the places of interest to   strangers, there are many galleries of paintings very fine,   there is at this time an annual exhibition at the Louvre, of   new pieces, some private collections also
I have in my   silent musing’s in immagination revisited most of your   dwellings,  Dear Aunts Ruth and Margery very frequently   present themselves before me, when we left home they both   seemed feeble, I hope their lives may be prolonged to the   comfort of their children by whom they are surrounded, but   it seemed to me [that] the sun of their day was near   [setting] in a tranquil evening, if My Dear Cousin this   excites sufficient interest in thy breast to induce a reply,   information of them as well as many other members of our   family would be grateful to us who are situated so far from   many they still hold dear, please remember us affectionately   to them All,  Richard and Ruth, Caleb and Martha, Samuel   Henry, and thy children from thy attached Cousin
Sarah B   Corbit

Nov: 20th 1907   –

My very dear friends —

We have just finished   reading in the Montrose papers, which my daughter Annie   Sayne brought down to me this p.m. – the account of the   Dedication of dear Clemmie’s donation to all the people of   old Susq: Co: & under its inspiration I feel that I must   immediately x x x x –––––––––1908 Jan. 4th –

— To prove that my dear friends have   not been entirely forgotten, – I have the audacity to   continue this letter – begun so long ago as almost to be   forgotten unless it be for this purpose! –  An interruption   occurred, during which time Minnie told me that she was   writing or had written to you, & when I asked where she wd.   address it, she said "Oh, in c/o Misses Biddle – they are in   Montrose". —  I demurred, but neither of us knew theGermantown address & altho’ I said "No. 1. Walnut St."   always held a clue – & had for nearly 100 yrs. past, – but   she laughed, – said that date was obsolete, – & now I doubt   if you ever did get her letter! –  I wish I cd. see you, & I   think our tongues wd. travel fast, –  Writing has become   rather irksome to me, – particularly with pen & ink as my   fingers have very much stiffened in my old age – so I   generally write with a pencil(when I think my frds. will not   object,) & I do not write much, except to my two sons, – who   are in R.R.d business at Sydney,– Nova Scotia. —

— We   have had such a hard summer,– partly owing to the delusions   these conceited Virginians had,– that "all the world & his   wife" wd. almost break their necks to get here to see their   wonderful state & its historic surroundings – then their   disappointments & losses were not cheerful or conducive to   cheery letter writing, & I hate to write doleful letters. —If it were not so pathetic,– it wd. be very amusing to see   the downfall of the hopes they all had of making such   enormous fortunes.–  Hundreds & thousands of dollars have   been lost, for the whole thing was a complete fizzle & not   being completed until away into October, & therefore but   little attendance,– those who did come disparaging it, & the   day after the gates were closed, it was put right into the   hands of a receiver!! –  Virginia has not had such a   staggering blow since Appomattox! –

— We have seen   very little ofMiss Walcott altho we attend the same church, but she lives   at the farther side of our town & the trip involves a   trolley ride- a ferry across Hapton Creek & a walk to each   end of the line.-
I am so sorry to hear of Carrie’s   increased deafness, - & descouraged too.- for I have grown   very deaf myself. & when she had all the medical faculty of   Europe to consult, & they did not cure her, - it is not   worth while for me to try. - Is it hereditary with her?- I   don’t remember either of your parents beingafflicted in that way. –  The strongest point in my memory   about them – is your father’s good sound "orthodox" dignity   – always so cheerily smoothed over, by your Mother’s   beautiful almost angelic smile which brightened almost   everybody & everything around them. –  I don’t wonder he   went to bed, when she was taken from him, & could never be   persuaded to rise again. –  I must close this now for my   messenger to take to the post office. –

— How I do   wish you would come to see us.  I hardly know any one who   would be more welcome. –  Now, think it over & see if you   can’t come,– particularly if a cold wave strikes Germantown.   —

Good bye – in which both my girls join, – don’t   ever doubt me, but believe me always your loving &   affectionate friend
Sibylla T. Morris.

Title: 1841 April, to Frank, Philada.

Dear Frank
Somewhere in the Month of April, AD      1841

If you are in want of a mystery profound enough      to merit the attention and task the scrutiny of your      powerful mind - endeavor to ascertain if you can what whim      has led me to take this mammoth sheet for my letter instead      of confining myself as heretofore to the narrower limits of      a [Quarto]  It has puzzled me – I thought first of greatness      in the Abstract – how greatness Sympathises with greatness –      How you cant get a Barrel of praties in a Bushel Basket –      and wondered if that was the reason – Some I reasoned Are      born to greatness – some achieve greatness and some have      greatness thrust upon them – and I have come to that      conclusion that struggle against it as I may in spite of all      I may do – greatness is my destiny. ------

“Tantaeni      animis celestibus irae!!” as [Maro] said when the Caelicoli      plagued poor Aeneas half out of his wits. ---  I know      Francis that the provocation was extreme – like unto the      emotions of a female Tiger robbed of her young by some      felonious and ruthless hand – some Yankee Menagerie-Keeper –      who reflects (not the Keeper but the Tiger) that her striped      Darlings will be exposed to the vulgar eye far from their      native land. far from her and from her caresses. – who knows      that in them she has lost perhaps the prop of her declining      years and feels that she is altogether lonely –      

“They will never come she said”
“She said I am      a-weary a-weary”
“Would God that I were dead”!      –

like unto her heart-rending emotions are emotions      of a Poet moaning over the loss the abstraction by      unhallowed hands of his fancy’s creations – his children of      the Brain  She whet her incisors – He mends his pen –      
Her sullen growl resounds thro the forest. = fearful      flies the trembling thief – the invader of their domestic      hearth and social joys. – She sees him in the blue distance      farther than any eye can pierce save the eye of a Mother      bereaved of her offspring --  Guilty wretch! and dont thou      expect such crimes to prosper – Fly as thou may the avenger      is behind – She springs from the tangled Brush – one blow      and her little ones are free and the blood of the ravisher =      washes down his bones – The Poets eye rolls in indignant      fury – He paces up and down – and much Ink must be shed.       Black ink – to expiate his wrongs ------

But Frank I      quote from “L’Entreprise No. 8” “Memory is mortal      forgiveness divine” – There is a difference between the      charity of the Christian and the blind revenge of the beasts      that perish – and I see that thou art well acquainted with      the precept concerning the smiting of one cheek and the      subsequent turning of the other – since – when thou wast      informed of the use I had made of thy Serenade thee sends me      on another piece which I am sorely tempted to appropriate to      the same purpose – viz. “The Thief” an Indignation ode      -----

But “L’Entreprise” is of the things that have      been = its star has set – When it again rises and illumes      our horizon once more – any pieces you may favor me with      will meet with particular attention and speedy insertion –      To Encourage your Modesty I will only hint
at the numerous encores and complimentary remarks which I      appropriated at its reading in our Junto. – I must confess I      had some conscience pangs – at thus robbing you of your due      and ventured to hint that they were entirely mistaken about      the Authorship – But all that was attributed to my modesty      and I could not make them believe it – So any more Serenades      you want inserted or Indignation Odes – either – send them      along and I’ll father ‘em with pleasure ----

As to      that little Biographical sketch in the “Ledger” the idea      pleases me exceedingly – It is not always the fate of Genius      to hear its praises Its requiem is rarely listened to – till      Death has untuned the Ear to praise and “cold obstruction”      chilled the heart and closed the eye – But sometimes Fate      decrees otherwise. -- & To your hands I commit with pleasure      myself and my memory – and to encourage you I think you      would make considerable of a Buzzy – I had thought some time      since I could trace thy classic pen in that respectable      Journal – Sometimes perhaps in the Poet’s corner – and again      I have suspected thy assistance (as Charles Lamb and Dun      Stuart have done before thee - ) [Reparter] “compiler      impromptu” composer and Wellerism manufacturer at a fippenny      bit a head

Dont forget Frank to put in how like twin      puppies we hunted the Muses together – How “hand in hand we      climbed the steep ascent of Parnassus” – and drank from the      same pitcher of the sparkling fountain – and if thee wishes      it I dont know that I shall object to thy inserting that      chaste production of thy blushing and almost virgin Muse –      the ode to Fanny – Though I bethink myself that piece would      better become the columns of the “Little Genius” – for there      was about it an independent air – a noble boldness which      some – nay, many – are too narrowed by the conventional and      affected delicacy of the day fully to appreciate and which      the Little Genius so openly advocates and patronises –      

With this I send you a critique on a Philadelphia      poet one who “blossomed in the desert air” of our unfriendly      climate but who like a wise prophet sought honor elsewhere –      No man is a hero to his valet’s deschambre and Pliny would      never have sucked Parnassian pap to advantage if he had      lived and died a Teacher at Providence School – What a      blight this “Times” man seems to want to throw upon poor      Pliny’s Laurels.  – No mincing matters Regulae cut & slash.       – When I see such an article I always fancy the Burden on my      own shoulders – Just Fancy some of your Serenades served in      the same style – Not kidnapped – eloped with out of pure      affection but barbarously mangled, murdered, its throat cut      from ear to ear.  – Like to a Tiger &c &c (on the other page      - )

New England Yearly Meeting of Friends is held at      New Port from 7th day the 12th of the 6th month to 6th day      the 18th inclusive commencing with the Meeting for      Sufferings – which however thou knowst is only patent to      Cardinals and chief priests of the synagogue First Day is      generally “the Yearly Meeting” par eminence and is usually a      great day at New Port.  Then may be seen straight coats of      the strictest sort – straight coats of a more accommodating      
curve – straight coats which one would hardly know were      straight and it grieves me to mention – some utterly devoid      of straightness – Broad Brims black, drab, or otherwise from      six inches in diameter to a lesser number – or a fraction –      Bonnets which the unsullied snow wreath could not rival in      maiden purity setting off eyes of all colors – noses of all      shapes – and mouths of all degrees of prettiness –      interspersed with some of the adornment of the daughters of      vanity ------ flitting past in crowds – and every now & then      the youth of the company indulging in cachinnations calling      down upon them with speedy rebuke of the more serious &      elderly – while old peaceable looking chassis and wagons      drawn by the most demure looking ponies in the world string      along through the streets and all bound to Yearly-Meeting –      New Port has many other attractions besides Yearly Meeting      however – The ride on the Beach – the Glen the [Fort] and      the Sail in the Harbour take away considerably from the      tedium of the long sittings – and besides Paradise &      Purgatory can be visited – much easier than was done in the      times of Hercules & pious Aeneas – as to the girls I have      often told them that I worship them
“as      stars

Whose purity and distance make them      fair”
and thee must get another pilot when thee comes on      such sounding but I do not despair however and may perhaps      with a few Lessons from thee become “a nice young      man”
All this I put forth expecting you to come & visit      us then – If you will be there – day & month aforesaid – I      will meet you and I think I may promise you a pleasant week      – Harry I suppose put more faith in Fanny [Ell---] than in      any one else – so he will hardly affect a Yearly Meeting of      the spiritually “Exercised –

New York 6 mo 17th 1857 —

My dear Anne,

Laura   just brought me up thy letter to read I had been lying down   since dinner and after our journey down to meeting felt like   resting –  I felt almost afraid to go down in the   neighbourhood of the City Hall where we went to Stewart’s to   get some tarleton muslin to see if we could not fold it so   as to cover the cracks of William’s big looking glass – it   will look better and I expect Laura will have it hung in the   spare room, where thee can look at thyself from head to foot   when thee comes on –  felt glad that Rebecca happened to be   out ready to take thy place in waiting on thy mother –   forgot to say why I was afraid to go in the neighbourhood of   the City Hall suppose the papers have informed you of the   riot between the police appointed by the Mayor and those   under the Govenor there was a great time yesterday but I   believeit is all quiet at present.  I suppose they have a queer   sort of a mayor here and I felt a hope that after this   outbreak that a new order of things may be instituted and   that we shall have the Streets cleaned –  I want thee to   tell Anna that I feel so much obliged to her for telling me   of the remedy for dyspepsia  I have been so much better   since I commenced taking it –  I hope that I shall be able   soon to partake with others of what is put on the table.  I   am so fond of clams, and as they are so nice here at New   York and we have them frequently, I feel it quite a   deprivation –  Am able to eat strawberries.  We had them in   abundance at Father’s where we went 7th day evening sisters   Amelia & Hannah were there and several cousins went with us   besides Barclay and the country was so beautiful and so   sweet from the clover fields that it did seem to me quite a   treat – we left second day morning in the cars for New York   –  Came in the accommodation trainby the way of Amboy – it was new to me and I enjoyed it much   more than the other route by Trenton –  Last evening Solon   Robinson one who writes for the "Tribune"* [*Is one of the   editors I am told] spent the evening with us he is a near   neighbour – he wrote the "hot Corn" stories for the Tribune   and lately "a day in the country" which appeared in that   paper – a singular looking man his age is 54 – wears a beard   probably 6 inches long and perfectly white, his hair also   long and white – he told us he had travelled with one pair   of horses from New Orleans to Chicago and from thence to New   York $5000 miles and the horses just ready to run away the   day after he got home – he described his attack of Cholera   on the Missisippi and of the enormous dose of opium, Quinine   &c which they gave him of the former quite an ounce he   thought –  I told him of [Gimre’s] himaepathic potion!–  He   also mentioned an illness of the smallpox and said he had it   as badly as it was possible – upon my remarking that he was   not pitted with it he told me howhe prevented it by covering the pustules immediately upon   breaking with collodion –  Some of the pustules were as   large as a hickory nut, others smaller – but not a place on   his whole person where he could have put a quarter of a   dollar down with out touching some – we were entertained   with his conversation but did not admire him any of us –   quite eccentric –  I did not know he wrote the "hot corn   stories" untill he left – he was down on the beggars said it   was sinful to give indiscriminately seemed to think it was   no use to give to them that they could not be made to help   themselves – that they might as well die one time as another   which quite shocked us to hear him say – he has distributed   about $12000 and I suppose has become totally discouraged in   the prospect of doing any good –  He thinks almost all are   petty thieves –  Laura has had 4 articles taken that she had   put out with ashes in – knows not what to do – they will   take even a barrel and break up for firewood –  Thos Leggett   had their door mat stolen as well as Woodwards’ and the next   door the other side –  We have concluded to keep ours in the   hall as it has escaped hithertoEvery few minutes there is a knock at the basement door –    Robinson says "let them knock and take no notice –" does it   not seem queer that a man that could write so feelingly   about the poor should say so? – but indeed we know not what   to do scarcely and to feel that we do right –  I never saw   such a place –  One evening Thos Leggett was in here about   dark we were all in the basement and a poor little thin   creature like Katy came to ask for something –  Tom thought   he would go with her and see her home which he did and after   he returned he could not speak for tears – the scene of   utter destitution affected him so much –  The father could   not work had the ague and he thought that they looked as if   they had all become thin through want of food – she had been   coming here almost daily for food since –  This morning we   saw a group of little ones the largest girl carrying a box   which looked to be an ash box and Laura thought looking back   apprehen-sively.  We thought they had stolen it.  Robinson may feel   more than he pretends to about them –  We heard he wrote for   a long time "City Items" for the Tribune and they almost all   contained some interesting incidents respecting the poor –   he informed us he possessed remarkably  descriptive powers   that nothing he saw escaped his notice &c.  We concluded he   must be a genius and consequently eccentric – he told us he   had an adopted daughter that always shaves him – cuts his   hair makes  all his clothes with the assistance of a sewing   machine as well as all her own sewing and sometimes  her   shoes –  William thinks it likely she is one perhaps that he   has rescued –
We found Nealie here after we returned from   meeting we are all invited up there Seventh day (Barclay and   ourselves)– we expect to go if they get a cook–  A few days   ago an old servant of theirs dropped down dead whilst at   work in the kitchen which was a great shock to them they had   to have a coroners inquest – Laura says perhaps we will go   and take Martha tocook whilst we stay –  Laura has engaged the nicest little   girl to run errands do chamber work  &c – she does work   admirably  sews beautifully – irons &c  they think she will   suit them better than a larger girl – she is a trim little   thing with beautiful hair which she has always in nice order   – got a very good character of her – the gentleman she lived   with (a lawyer) wrote her character – that she was the best   child he had ever known in her capacity – they parted with   her in consequence of going out West –
I do not remember    whether I told you about the Cornell’s friends of Hannah   Leggett who board with them the elder (Eliza) has been a   teacher in one of the best schools in the city received a   salary of $600 – she is going to be married in about three   weeks to Albert Smiley.  she is a sweet looking girl as well   as a younger sister with whom Barclay has become  well   acquainted – JL Woodward is very much interested in them –   he likes young company – when Laura told his wife that she   thought perhaps some of hercousins would come home  with us – she said "Mr Woodward   will be delighted"  We are to take tea there this evening –   Leggetts & ourselves –
5th day.  We heard that Mayor Wood   was obliged to accept warrants from the Metropolitan police   who accompanied by Gen Sandford presented them to him—he is   under arrest – I feel anxious to hear what has transpired to   day –  Lewis & William and every New Yorker I expect are so   much interested –  Wood has behaved  so badly –  It was   thought that Sandford had acted with great circumspection   and he was the hero of the day – but if the Mayor had not   submitted, he told him that the law would be enforced at the   point of the bayonet – happily yesterday passed without   bloodshed –  The mayor with his 800 policemen were in the   City Hall = It was suggested that they might be starved into   submission by preventing egress –
Well Anne dear I hope   thy foot will not trouble thee long it was the best thing to   take care in time of a sprained ancle – such a useful little   body as thee has become  cannot be spared very well –  Laura   joins me in love to all at Awbury – will write soon to thee   herself as I have more time on my hands I have taken the pen   this time and shall be glad 
to have a reply –  I am   looking for an answer to my letter from Julia soon we do   enjoy getting letters so far away from all of you –Must now say farewell as my sheet is filled and remain as   ever thy very affectionate Aunt Martha

Dearest Clemmy,
I wonder      where your darling little ladyship is at this moment?  I      wish it was here amid all the greenness & breezes of      Newport, Ocean Airs, & perhaps you are or are Coming as I      know you do sometimes.  For me –  You know I was with my      dear Aunt last winter & now that she has taken this fine      house I am with her Still – & certainly it is the perfection      of living.  My Aunt has taken the whole house it is neat &      handsome & an excellent table – $1.000 per month.  when we      are at breakfast our rooms are arranged.the owners live in some mysterious addition to the house but      we never see or hear anything of the machinery
Aunt has      her maid & my cousin –(by the way Clemmy since I cant now      have you for a "Sister" how would "Cousin"– suit thee? he is      very good & wealthy & well born &c?) has his man & horses –       There are lovely trees & fields all round –  We are on "the      Avenue" next the Ocean House, & in front is the large place      of a Cousin – the lady is an only child & her father lately      died leaving 7. millions!  So the world is shared!  They      spent the evening here last night – looking as joyous as tho      they had 7 milns but not at all as tho’ a new tombstone      stood for them in a graveyard,  so the world goes!  But oh!      give me less. & a heart aching to deaths very door for the      filled grave.– however long ago = Who would take joy if it must be      coupled with heartlessness?  Thank God for real griefs      whatever He sends.  Do they not "all work together for      good",  & then there are so many bright delicious joys!       Thank God indeed for them!  The world is so full of      sunshine!  If the railroad is finished into our beautiful      town – Aunt & my Cousin will visit me, & also – "whether or      no" A Cousin of mine who is here now with us – wife of the      late "President of the New York College of [Physiciary] &      Surgeons" & sister of a very lovely lady a Mrs Highbee who      boarded awhile at Mr D. Lathrops in Montrose in 1867, while      I was in Europe.  She seems quite delighted with the      prospect – & now I want you to come also & visit me the      latter part of August & SeptemberI told Aunt she must let me go home then & dear Clemmy I do      want your dear sensible loving heart – & I think I could      make it pleasant to you – I will be very good, & let you go      to Miss Walkers & your other friends & if your parents &      sisters or brothers are up we will entertain them –  Give      them a handsome party as I gave those dear Dr & Mrs Parker      last fall.  Come!  My Cousin Mrs Edwin A Stevens, whose      husband left some 60 or 70 millions has invited me – to      visit her but I would rather have you as my guest –  So now      write me immediately & tell me you are coming to me.

Locust Shade. 5. 27. [18]65

My dear Annie, 

It   seems to me that a very improper time has elapsed since the   receipt of they welcome letter, without my having answered   it - but as we are both well hosted in excuses I will not   add to the list.- Just as I began my letter, thy kind note   was handed me - & I truly thank thee for it and should love   to comply with they request - but [dont] see that it would    be possible. Besides dearie I want thee to come here - and   hope to persuade thee to do so.- Your place must indeed   looklovely & I have thought several times how I should like   to look uponits beauty and enjoy your society - which is always so   pleasant, but I must deny myself this time- I want too, to   hear about the wedding & Clemmy & diverse other things. Our   “Strawberry Company” as thee calls it, is not here- tho we   have had several of our friends the past week, - and shall   probably have more [next]. - - Our cook had gone away for a   fortnights visit, half of the time is gone - at which I   rejoice, and this is another reason why I cannot leave home-   the next week father and mother will be away for a Sundays-   and after that I do hope thee will come to see me. Any day   that suits thee we shall gladly welcome thee. - 

I   heard from Deborah Thomas that Clemmy was pleasantly   situated and like her occupation.- Thee must miss her visits   very much & she thine. - Lily seemsquite absented in her work and is turning out a very      managing young lady - it will probably be of great use to      her in calling out her latent energies.- 

How many      remarkable & [steming]  events have transpired since we were      together.- It seems to me we have, every day, reason to      mourn death of our own dear good President -  Johnson is so      different - & if he should get us into a Mexican war it      would be so sad. But we can but hope for the best. Was it      not wonderful how suddenly & completely the Rebellion cam to      an end. Like the “One hoss slay”- it all broke down at      once.- Poor Jeff makes a sorry figure in his humiliation he      is showing very plainly what a poor miserable specimen  of a      man he was.- Niether true courage or honor in the slightest      appreciative of his great crimes. -- We have justhad our Bettie at home for ten days and busy enough we were   with her spring clothing - she comes back again the last of   next month for vacation.- She is growing so companionable   that I miss her when she is gone very much.-
I am glad to   hear Uncle D B Smith sometimes gets to your house. no doubt   it does him good. Wish I could see him. Will thee give him   my love when thee see him.- Suppose Uncle John & Aunt R   Smith & cos Lizzie are out in the broad Ocean. we hear our   cousin Richard Howland was to go with them, but do not know   if its true. If aunt R’s health is improved - it will be   delightful for them all to be together. Would thee not like   to go if thee could do so properly? - I should exceedingly,   but probably never shall, my life seems destined to be very   unadventurous and matter of fact, - all for the best no   doubt.- Do Lilly & her Philip’slive in Germantown? What a favored place you live in all the  nice people do mostly congregate there. R wishes to be  remembered to thee & hopes sometime to accept the very kind  invitation. Just now I [----] [------] are all engrossing. -  I hope thy father is pretty well this spring please remember  me to him.- With much love I am very truly thee thee  at[----] 
S. S. Reeve

I hope thee has not got any  of those little salt sellars yet, as I have has a pair  waiting for thee ever so long, Will send them down next week  if I can. -

Title: 1904 August 25, Duchy Lausanne, to Rachel C. Evans

Duchy, Lausanne
8/25.1904.

My dear   friend
Rachel C. Evans.

In carrying out our   program for Switzerland, the weather has suddenly changed   from intense heat and a very long drought to a rain of   several days, which while most grateful to the parched   country, interferes materially with views of the charming   Lake of Geneva and the mountains that environ it. Instead   therefore, of our usual outdoor life, this gives just the   opportunity for which I've been wishing, to acknowledge some   of the very kind farewell greetings, received as we left our   native shores. The weather being so variable, it has seemed   best for one to remain in this most comfortable   Eng.-speaking pension, with a delightful out-look upon the   Lake, while my dear Hannah has gone into the 
upper regions, so as to get into closer touch with their   sublime peaks--at least so far as the fickle weather may   permit. Meanwhile therefore, my pen is giving me congenial   occupation in-doors.
Among the loving remembrances to   which I have referred, is thine from Franconia, U. N. of   [--] 28--I was truly glad also thus to receive good accounts   from you, and can only trust your outing in the bracing air   of New Eng. may be permanently helpful to thyself and your   dear Anna, of whom I often think with tender sympathy,   desiring that "the best of Physicians"--may keep her under   his all-wise and loving care. Turning away therefore, from   misgivings, or fears, or failures as they may seem to her,   may there be a more "continual looking into Jesus", not only   "as the author", but "the finisher of her faith". Let her   ever remember that it is this same Saviour of our's, who has   begun his work of grace in her heart that seeks to carry it   on and perfect it
to his praise, and her unspeakable peace. He knows her   better than she knows herself; and therefore, none so well   as He can "speak to her condition". It is thus He has   revealed himself to multitudes of struggling souls, and they   never seek His face in vain. Then it is that anxiety gives   place to a quiet childlike confidence in Him, and impatience   as to a more rapid growth in grace than we may have yet   known finds us more continually dwelling upon the abounding   love of God, and brings about that "patient waiting for   Christ", which the apostle craves for his fellow   believers.
While our best desires are turned in this   direction, there is nothing incompatible with the fullest   appreciation of the outward favors & blessings with which   our Heavenly Father has surrounded us. Indeed, we now   realize that these he has "given us richly to enjoy". We   recognize His good hand in them all, and so a continual   thanksgiving goes up from our hearts to Him, as the   all-bountiful giver. I see little to add to the few
hints as above, and would have thee to use them or not, only   as way may open--Indeed I can quite believe that, if a   fitting, natural opening does not occur, it may be best to   speak to Anna of nothing beyond my continued loving interest   in her.
As to the results of our own rambling, I may   thankfully say that, for myself, there seems a marked gain   in several respects, but, as thou has intimated, the full   benefit of such changes is sometimes felt later. My dear   Hannah could scarcely be in better condition for enjoying to   the full the scenes of rare interest and beauty thr'o which   we are and have been passing. I think however, we shall both   be glad when the time for our return voyage shall have come.   This will be 10/5, by the "Haverford", for Phila, and   shortly after, if the Lord will, we may hope to be once more   among our dear home friends--Please remember us in love to   Jon., while I remain

very sincerely thy friend
Sam   Morris

Springfield. Mass. Aug. 31st
4th day eve.

Dear   Papa & Mama,
We rec’d your letters this morning just as   we started & were very glad to get them, tho’ sorry to think   they came too late to engage rooms for you at the Cliff   House we were very anxious to hear from you in time, but you   were so long making up your minds, that we almost came to   the conclusion you were not going to at all, & had given it   up.  However Uncle H. thinks there will be no trouble in   getting them by writing afterwards.  We left Newport at 7   o’clock this morning & dined at Worcester very comfortably   about 2 o’clock & arrived here at 6 1/2 about.  Thishotel is delightful, they say it is one of the best in the   Union Sallie Parish says “its where all the brides come to,”   I haven’t seen any yet!  We got a splendid supper & Uncle   Harry & Chell & I took a little stroll through the town  it   seems very pretty as far as gas and star-light would show.    But me thinks we will not see much more of it, we propose   leaving quite early tomorrow morning for [Mt.] Holyoke.    Aunt Mary says “that all things considered she is certainly   remarkably well,” last 1st day she says she felt better than   she has for a year.  She is certainly improved, but don’t   raise your hopes to high or I fear you will be disappointed   – She’s better, but not well.  
They are talking,   talking! all the time, & I can’t write, Aunt [K]. has a very   nice room on the secondfloor, & Chell, Ginnie, & I have three cots put up in an   adjoining private parlor, its quite fine we’re all seated   round the centre table with a bright gas-light above us & a   velvate carpet beneath us, & the most delightful easy chairs   aren’t we splendid?  
Uncle H. says our present intention   is to come home in the 2 o’cl train 7th day (if the   time-table is right) I think we’ll not get out [--] 4, if we   change our plans we’ll telegraph.  Now Mother I must stop   for I want to fix my hat & its getting late.  Aunt M. says   she would have written but she has been retrimming Anna’s   hat & had no time.  Love to all
very   affec’ly
Lillie

P.S.  Resolved-that we take dinner   at Aunt [Annas], & come in quarter before 4P.S.  resolved that you need not expect us till we   come
P.S.  thats wrong!
P.S.  We will probably come   out in the 9 o’clock cars taking tea at the   Continental.
P.S.  Still talking can’t tell if this be   the final decision!
P.S.  Final decision! Seriously!  It   is extremely difficult to fix our plans, & we will   positively come home on 7th day either 1/4 4 or 9 o’cl   trains.
P.S.  Uncle Harry thinks we ought to give a   reason for our indecision.  Reason That we can not find   beforehand how long it will take to visit Mt. Holyoke as we   have to drive part of the way, & that makes it uncertain   whether we will reach New Haven tomorrow night or the next   day

My dear Friend,
This morning Agnes received   from thee a very kind & welcome letter which she wishes me   to answer at once, as we are both most anxious not to miss   the visit from you which we have been looking forward to   with so much pleasure.  And please do not leave England   without first spending a few quiet days with us, here.Agnes was strong enough to leave her bed for the first time   yesterday: she is up again today & as each day adds to her   strength, she will soon, we expect, be going about as usual.   We want you, therefore, if possible, to come to us from   North Wales (there is a good service of trains [---] Crewe)   next Friday week, if possible, the 25th inst. & stay over   Sunday, at least.  If you can do this (& please try!) my   Sister Hannah will, I hope, either come with you fromCrewe, or join you here.  She will relieve you of all very   active duties & so take away, we hope, all your most   considerable objections to coming to Mayfield just now.  If   you will only send me word where you will come from, I will   forward a list of our local trains at once. –
Please feel   fully assured that we wd. not press you to do this if we   felt there was any risk to Agnes.  It will be a real treat   to us to have you with us just as long as you can stay, and   a grievousdisappointment if we miss you. –
Since hearing from thee   last, we have often talked of you, & only two days ago. we   were rejoicing that you would now be able to come to us, as   the little stranger had arrived, & was doing well.  I hope   you have good tidings from home; we are enjoying this   delightful weather at our new house exceedingly.  In about   three weeks we hope to welcome James & Mary Taylor, who   winter here.  Caroline Shipley is still with us, much to our   pleasure.  With our warm love to Alexis & thyself, I   am,
Thine very sincerely,
J. Simpson.

Dear Mother & sisters,

Its   quite long since I have written to you & I expect you think   it strange I have not acknowledged the rect of the [---] by   express wh. arrived safely & timely.  I have not written   because I have been in such a whirl all the week that I   really have not been able to get a needful amt of sleep I   knew too that you wd. be occupied with the wedding, & wld.   not miss my letter.  I suppose the nuptials are over & I   hope passed off satisfactorily — I shall expect a full acct.   shortly.  The same eve that you were enjoying the wedding   festivities at [--------]I also was immersed in scenes of revelry & mirth — much   gayer tho perhaps not more enjoyable than those.  It was the   eve of Jessies grand party, -- wh. was the longest & gayest   I ever attended.  It was like a concentration of weddings   for all looked like brides & there were 80 or 90, — The   supper wh took place at 12 o’ck P.M. was magnificent.  The   meats & the fried crabs & the, sweet-breads--& the elegant   Baltimore confectionery & the ices & the fruits & the   flowers exceeded, as did also the ladies dresses—There were   two or three brides—J Hoag was one, but they were mostly   very gay fashionable people, & I felt some what out of   place--& I am very glad there are not likely to be any more   such entertainments, as I had to teach sch. thro. a sick   head-achenext morn wh. did not pay—I was very glad the skirt arrived   in time, & also that I had taken the precaution to have the   white body made I thot I looked quite nice, considering—at   least I shd. have thot so in Phila but theres no beating   these ‘Baltimo’--Belles--  I was presented by a gentleman   whose name begins with -- [J?] with a very beautiful bouquet   as were many other young ladies  This is the first evening I   have spent at home for a week & I expected to have spent it   in writing but a visitor came in—a young man named   [Joliff?]—he ask us to go to the top of the monument wh. we   have not yet got to, another youth has invited us to go this   week on an expedition to a placed called Federal Hill—so you   see we are quite belles.

The celebrated Emma Congdenfrm. Providence is here now.  She occasions a good many   little tea parties & I have met her several times.  She is   very lovely indeed.  Her father Gilbert C, visited me in my   sch. room the other day & was very cordial saying he   remembered being at our home in Susquea some years   ago.

I believe I have not written to you since the   young Englishman was here, he brot me a letter of   introduction frm. A. Harrison & I had the pleasure of taking   one or two walks & teas with him.  He made himself so   pleasant & agreeable that every body was quite charmed with   him.  He only stayed a few days but expected to be here   again.

Please tell [Amy?] & [Elg.?] dont forget that   Jesse wished me to let them know he had heard of a very good   safe & higly recommended hackney somewhere in these parts   wh. can be purchased for 200 dollars

Thanks for the   generous donation of stamps.  I think it will last me.Please tell them & tell Aunt Caroline that I was very much   obliged for her nice letter wh. I shd. like to reply to when   I can get time.  I lent it & the sermon to M. Cheston, who   seemed grateful.  I will endeavor to return the letter   safely. much love to them all.  I wrote to Tom a letter a   week or two ago wh. I suppose he got.

Laurel House July 19th

My  dear Mama,
Rachel has   spent herself so in writing to thee that it seemed hardly   worth while for me to try, so I thought I wld. wait till her   fever was over, & as this eve. she seemed little inclined to   desert the piazza, I concluded to undertake the task.  We   have had a most exercising day in all senses of the word,   but so wonderful is the effect of this mountain air that I   do not feel the least tired.  In the first place this   morning we set off in an open wagon for Haines’ fall a   pleasant ride of about 2 miles, but it was after we got   there the “tug of war” began –  We hada regular scramble, part of the way was so rough that Tom &   Walter concluded to remain behind & before we got through   there was no one left but Harry Ellie & Madge & I, we went   down to the very foot of the lower falls, & were well   repaid; it was a most beautiful spot, a succession of six   lovely little falls ending in cascades & rapids, it was   altogether quite charming, the prettiest place of the kind I   ever saw, & I don’t remember ever to have seen a photograph   of it –  We did not get home till after the dinner bell had   rung, so were obliged just to give a little smoothe to our   hair, & go in in our mountain dresses, but every thing is   very primitive here, & nobody pretends to dress for dinner.    As we were all preparedwe concluded instead of changing our dresses to go after   dinner down the stream about a mile to Bastion falls under   Tom’s piloting, & soon comes in the adventure – we just got   to the head of the fall, & were [nerving] ourselves for a   scramble to the foot, when some one remarked that it was   raining, & sure enough it was, we took shelter under some   trees and concluded it wld. soon be over, & we would wait,   but it got harder & harder, & at last found its way through   the branches, & came down on us in large drops, which were   decidedly wetting, we tried it for a little while, but   finding there was no sign of stopping & we were getting very   wet we concluded to push on home, –  At first it seemed to   have slaked alittle, but it soon began harder than ever, & we went   tearing along jumping over rocks & through bushes till we at   last arrived at the foot of the Kauterskill, & then there   were all those dreadful stairs to go up – however we pushed   on, & at last arrived panting at the house – we were pretty   objects to be sure all wet, & draggled, & hot – there were   several gentlemen sitting round on the piazza, & I thought   it a remarkable instance of politeness that they did not   ever smile, I’m sure I could not have resisted it.  Of   course we retired immediately to our appartments, & changed   every thing making ourselves most comportable & desidedly   more presentable.  Thee need not feel the least concern for   I don’t think we are any of us a bitthe worse, & the most remarkable part is we are not tired.    The only thing that suffered was our hats, but I guess they   will look pretty well when they dry, & we’ll have to retrim   them at Newport –  Thee must be sure & not forget my bonnet   so that if we should arrive 7th day night I may have   something to wear to meeting.  Also mother I think I forgot   to put on the list a thin white body of mine & my best   underbody that I wanted to have done up & brought in the   trunk – Virginia will know.  Tom wrote to Father yesterday   to go by 7th days steamer, & one of us will try to write by   the next.  We are having a most delightful time, & as thee   willsee by my account I am as well as possible, so thee need not   have any anxiety on my account.  I do hope you are getting   along nicely, & don’t feel very lonely, I know thee must   miss Father very much, but I hope he will be a great deal   better for his voyage & come home to us quite strong, & free   from all those miserable head-aches.  
Aunt L & Chell   send love, & the former says she is intending to write to   thee very soon.  
Give a great deal of love to all, &   Virginia especially I want to write to her, she was so very   kind in helping me to get ready to come away, I don’t know   what I should have done without her.  
Good-night dear   Mama,
thy ever loving
Lily

Downingtown Octor. 21. 1802.
My very dear   Son,

This ridiculous whim which thou hast adopted has   given me more pain than I can express,  I cannot conceive   what should induce thee, who is settled in the way thee   wished, on a good farm, which thee knows so well how to   manage and improve, without paying rent: To take it into thy   mind to leave thy all; a young family of precious children,   and parants in precarious health, to go 9000 miles on a   tempestuous sea, in the most dangerous season of the year,   art thou insane?  What can be thy inducement: compare thy   situation with hundred that are quite happy and contented;   Why art thou not so?  Why this unsettled idea? –  If thee   puts this scheme in practice, I hardly expect ever to see   thee again in this world, – even if thou should be spared to   return to those of thy friends that may be left –  Thee   wrote before we left town on this subject to thy father, But   I never saw the letter, WD. told me thee talk’d of going to   India, I expected thy father had wrote thee, and that it was   the thought of a moment that was now given over; thy letter   to thy father and brother rec’d yesterday, I might have   read, but that to William was enough for me, to think thou   art in earnest is more than I can, at times well bear –   consider well, my dear son what thou art [preparing]:   perhaps on thy return, if thou should be so favoured, thee   may find thy parants no more; and some of thy little ones   gone &c.  This is thee may say looking at the worst side of   things, but pray inform me what is the best side,  I see no   good that is likely to result from it–  Can thy scheme be a   view of money making, if so, will the little gain, thy   hardships may obtain, be equal to the loss and devastation   that may occur during thy absence–  do my dear Henry give up   this wild notion, be thankful for what thou hast, make the   best of it, and I trust, more will be added, if ‘tis   necessary for thee.–  thou hast, according to my ideas great   cause ofthankfulness –  thou mayst have trials that I know not of,   but going to the worlds-end will not cure them –  If “an   exemption from evil is a real good” how many evils art thou   exempt from? – be content and resign’d. –  If the former   desire of a trip to Great Britain had revived in thy mind   (tho I should hardly think it would in thy present   situation, and in those times of trouble) I should not   oppose it, at a suitable time of the year, if thou could   leave thy family and farm with propriety:  but this   East-India notion may be ruineous if put in practice –    There is no one that loves thee but would be grieved at such   a procedure – not a single word has past between thy father   and myself on this business, till [ye] day he recd. thy last   letter, when I mentioned my very great concern on thy acct.   he say’d it was a rediculous foolish whim –  Do my dearest   Henry give over all thoughts of leaving all that is near and   dear to thee for a phantom, and if thee does, I am of the   first oppinion thee will never have reason to repent it. –   Thee may remember when thee first concluded to be a Farmer,   I oppos’d it, wishing thee near me while I lived – but   seeing thee seem’d fixed in that way, I gave up my wishes –   and since, the frequent attacks of malignant fever in our   City, I think I may truly say, I have been thankful thee was   so well and happily, as I thought, settled on a good Farm –   where I hope thee will content thyself and remain. –  Jacob   Downing has been several days in and near the City, he wrote   to Sally that the fever was worse, a greater number of new   cases, than at any other time, Dr. Rush told him it wd. be   very improper for our family to return, as there was several   ill, not far from us. –  Joseph Downing has been very unwell   with fever and pain in his head, not yellow fever, he is   rather better – last week we had concluded to return home on   first or second day last, but hearing of the death of a   baker not far from us, and two cases in Elfriths’ Alley, and   several in [Keys’] alley, thy father gave it over for [ye]   present, ‘tho he is very desireous of being at home – To be   seperated from my Children at those times of difficulty is a   trial to me.  Our dear Nancy who has been at times unwell,   has been much in my thoughts, ‘till Iread thy letter to thy brother, which has filled my mind   with little else but thee –  Thy dear father has had many   attacks of his old complaint, and frequently disordered   bowels, has taken liquid ladanum every night for some weeks   past, he is at present better of the gravelly complaint, but   not well in his bowels.–  A Letter, or rather small packet   directed by thee to James Smith came here by some mistake   with thy other two – thy father has sent it back to the City   –  I hope ‘ere long to see thee, after mature deliberation,   fully convinced of thy mistake – which will be a very great   satisfaction to thy trully affectionate mother E.   Drinker

No one here knows any thing of thy intention   that I know of, not a word of it has been mention’d – indeed   it is a subject that we cant bear to talk on  My love is to   Hannah and the Dear Children –Paid 10

My dear Friend,
I have been waiting till thy   beautiful gift came home, in its Oak Frame, before sending   thee in words the warm thanks which I feel for such an   evidence of thy kind thought. It was, indeed, a surprise, to   me when dear Annie returned, and I shall value the gift not   only for the kind giver’s sake, but for its own intrinsic   beauty.
I wish thee could see it in the Hall – in the   place of honour nearthe Dining Room Door. It is mounted in white, with plain   gilt bead, flat oak frame, unvarnished, and, as all admit,   it is just a household treasure, nothing less. Didst thee   know my weakness for Raphael? I have seven of his Cartoons,   [famed] & his own portrait besides! So thou seest what a   treat thou hast given me! Ere long I hope [thee] will see   the "Candelabri" where it now hangs. –
And you are now in   Florence – close by the Cathedral – & the Grand Duke’s   Palace – & John of Bologna’s masterpiece – & the Pitti &   Uffizzi galleries!  Oh,what would I not give for a quiet day at Fiesole just now?   Of course you have been there, & seen these chaste, quaint,   spirituelle works of the saintly Angelo. I enjoyed them   exceedingly. Almost as much – tho’ in a different way – to   Angelo’s Night & Day &c in the Church of St. Lorenzo. By the   way, I hope you have Childe Harold with you and Roger’s   Italy. Do read both on the spot, and when you next go to the   [----] Room (I forget its [right] name) at the Pitti pray   make, on my behalf, a salaam of special reverence before its   priceless treasures.Agnes will tell you all our domestic details. We should much   like to hear how my dear friend, your Sister Clementine, now   is. If she comes to England during your absence, please send   us word, for I should feel it a pleasure to offer her a   welcome to England on her arrival in L’pool.
Annie has   given us delightful accounts of your adventures. I trust you   both suffer no longer from the cold. Won’t you let us see   your art mementoes on yr. return?  How rich you must   feel!
With our united love to both, – & renewed thanks, I   am thine, sincerely,

Tues.   Morning. 

My dearest old Chellie.
If only I could   have thee within earshot, even if it was but by the   agitating telephone, how I could pour forth to thee! But   instead I'm afraid it will be rather a sorry makeshift as my   mind & hand are far from steady,- both of these show up   worse on paper. Dear heart, I don't know how to tell thee   what all this loving thought has meant to me this past week.   It seemed as
if it literally "encompassed" me- such dear words by letter   here [-ailing] with those exquisite flowers & then the sweet   little book- it was all most heast warming & dearer of thee   than I can say- Bless thee again & again - & oh! how very   good is the [--------] deep, true love that I know all these   things represent! I saved the little book as I said, until   we got well away, & each day’s sweet thought has been so   cheering through these rather dismall days. Thy own dear   words, best of all-in spite of Dora Greenwell’s perfect understanding of the   deep things of friendship- Anna’s packet has been a perfect   delight to us & hope to tell her myself if possible. But we   still roll so badly that writing is not very easy, & we have   left it until almost the 11th hour hoping for better things   [we] mail this at [-------]. We found most capital   staterooms waiting for us, & started forth quite gaily with   so many little last hand shakes from our kind friends, but   that first dinner is the only meal we have taken in the   Saloon, & we have kept ever quietly to our rooms except for   a few hours on Sunday when we could sit on deck. Not that we   have had any stormbut it was very cold, snowed a little the first three days,   & we had high seas. This with a heavy cargo of grain has   kept us rolling hard all the way over, for a large export of   cotton that would have steadied the ship, failed to arrive   in time, we hear, & also we are not properly ballasted. But   we are making good time, & hope to be in tomorrow (wed.)    evening probably too late to get home, but in time to lay   our heads on a steady pillow!
In spite of all the   knocking about we have had, trunks traveling across the   floor &c. we have neither of us been down to the crisis, but   intense nausea has made a complete coward of me, & L has had   no ambitions! She sends her dear love & hopes to write soon   her thanks for the lovely carnation & roses. My dear love to   you all, that often
I have recalled my [coming] visit to   you! Fare thee well thee very dear person always thy loving   old

Laurel House July 21st/67

My dear Father,
Tom has   written to thee so very lately, that I fear I can hardly   find enough of interest to fill a second letter, & besides I   am almost afraid to write one to go so far, & cost so much;   but perhaps a little Cattskill news would not be unwelcome.    We have been here for several days but owing to the   unkindness of the weather have not been able to accomplish   as much as we could wish – we made one very successful   expedition to Haines’ falls on 6th day morning, we took a   carriage or rather an express-wagon & rode over there, & had   a fine scramble, we went down the stream to the lower falls,   & scrambleddown to the foot, Tom concluded not to go all the way as it   was so rough & hard, & one after another gave out until when   we arrived at the foot there was no one but Harry, Ellie,   Madge & I left, but we were very glad we persevered &   thought ourselves well repaid, you never told us last fall   how beautiful it was.  We did not get home till after they   had gone to dinner so were obliged to go in just as we were   in our mountain dresses, & as we were all prepared concluded   to go under Tom’s guidence to visit Bastion falls   afterwards.  So about 4 we set off prepared to have a very   jolly time, Tom went ahead and cleared the way, & we   followed jumping over the logs & stones which Thomas   declare[d] were not there last fall, & must be the result of   last winters slide;Just as we arrived at the head of the fall, & were   congratulating ourselves on the prospect before us, what   should it do but begin to rain!  At first we thought it   would only be a little shower, & took shelter under the   trees as there were unfortunately no overhanging rocks –   this did very well for a little while, but instead of   stopping the rain got harder & harder, & at last began to   find its way through the trees & onto us – we soon found   ourselves getting very moist, & began to confer on measures   of relief, it was at length concluded as we were already   quite wet, & there was no sign of stopping to start for   home.  At first it seemed to slacked a little & we pushed   bravely on, but it got faster & faster & by the time we   reached the foot of Cauterskillwe were thoroughly drenched & in despair at having to ascend   all those dreadful steps – I wish thee could have seen us as   we came up to the house too tired to run any more dragging   along all dripping & hot, looking as much as possible like   drowned rats.  The gentlemen on the piazza were so polite as   not even to smile, but I’m sure I could not have helped. it.   I don’t think we any of us suffered for it though, & I did   not even feel tired in the evening, this mountain air is so   invigorating.  Yesterday it rained perseveringly & we had to   amuse ourselves as best we could reading, & walking on the   piazza.  The company here is not as congeneal as we could   wish, & we often envy Aunt Annie & Cous. Clem in their   Adirondack society.  One young gentleman regaledus last night with some Scotch songs, but it was very   inferior to Carry Rowland’s performance.  I think Tom told   thee that we have the same room you had last year, & enjoy   it very much, it is so nice having that beautiful view   always before us, I think I enjoy it much more than the map   in front of the Mountain House; it is so constantly   changing, sometimes that distant mountain will be entirely   hid by the clouds, & it is so beautiful to see them coming &   going; we have had no perfectly clear weather since we   arrived, & have become almost discouraged, & the   chamber-maid told me by way of comfort yesterday, that it   sometimes rained strait aheadfor a week, however it really does look like clearing now,   the clouds are drifting away, & there are great patches of   blue-sky.  If it is clear tomorrow we have planned an   expedition to the Plauterkill which I hope will be a   success.  Tom Stokes & Harry had intended starting on a   fishing excursion yesterday but after routing out of their   beds about 4, & eating sandwitches preparatory to starting,   were obliged to give up on account of the rain, & go back to   bed in disgust.  We have only received one letter from home   which reported all well, but by the time this reaches thee   thee will have received more recent news.  All send their   love & wishes for thy welfare wh. means I suppose that they   hope thee is not awfully sick, in which I heartily join,   Thee must notimagin from my description that we are not having a good   time for we are only the rain was a little dampening but   since the sun has come out we feel very lively & up to any   amount of of scrambling.  Write by every steamer & tell us   every thing.
Thy very affectionate

<br   My dear Friend,
When I received thy very welcome letter,   & the handsome volumes which accompanied it, I felt once   more that strong desire, which often stirs me, to visit   America, & to see again those dear friends who, nearly   thirty years ago, received me there with such unbounded   kindness.  Some of these have passed away, but a few are   left, and of these thou, my dear friend, with thy good   Brotherand your dear Wives, are kept in very cherished remembrance.   So it was delightful to get thy letter, & since its receipt   I have spent several hours in reading, with great interest,   this excellent Life of your great President.  How it has   recalled the old days!  I have gone over so much that had   lain dormant so long, & am more than ever impressed with   Lincoln’s marvellous development from his miserable early   surroundings. How could any man so outlive his environment?    And who could have believed that any man with such aparentage, & such debasing influences around him in early   life, could, by any innate power, or any outward   circumstance, become the great man Lincoln proved himself   later on.  We are slow to learn God’s lesson that He chooses   his instruments very differently to ourselves.
So far as   I can test Mr. Morse’s accuracy, he is very just; neither   hiding Lincoln’s shortcomings nor wishful to make out “a   case,” pro or con, but to act judicially.  I hope to give   our Workpeople an hour’s talk this Winter, based largely   upon this interesting Biography.Thanks for thy kind message to Agnes & the [baines].  All   are well.  How I wish they could see thee in the flesh, for   they often hear thee quoted, and are familiar with thy face,   through the Portrait which is hung, with Uncle Smith   Harrison’s, in our Library – the much valued gift of thy   good son, Hazen – to whom please give my love.
I trust   you are all well: it would be a real pleasure to see you all   again, but, at present, I see no chance of getting away.    With our united love to all our friends at Awbury, I   am,
Thine, very sincerely

Oh Poesy! what wight of Wretched State
Een at the lowest   bottom of his woe
When griefs surround him or sad toils   await

Come   gentle soother of wan misery’s train

Come shower thy spirit down on me   again
*For Frank Cope wants a letter – shall he want in   vain!!!!
*Here the Poet alludes to Danae & Jupiter   olympus an ancient buck

So Henricus is dead! dead ere   his prime!

Add cubits to   his stature or his days –
Vain task to stop the fateful   cruel hand

But as in   olden time, when-freshly sprung
From the great Maker’s   hand – all Earth was fair
Excelling in its beauty – fresh   & young
When strength & health perfumed with the balmy   air 
And all Earth’s Gifts were far beyond compare   
With what now ‘neath Heaven’s weary blessing   grows
What time the grove Hesperia apples bare
From   out the salt salt wave fair Venus rose
Graceful her   dripping locks she round her did dispose

So from the   Sorrow tearful deep & sad
Which mourns thy memory   departed Shade
While oer the dust which erst thy spirit   clad

Just as you please

Dear Chellie, 
I have been      waiting for news, before answering your last letter and am      now not much better off, but you write such very short      letters that I am not at all conscientious about making mine      short also.  I wish my dear, that you would make your      letters a little longer, & if you do not you will see mine      gradually decreasing in length, till there is hardly any      letter at all.

Uncle Clem never told a soul that he      was going and on Sunday night when John went to the      Baltimore depot to see Gerge Emlen and John Thayre off to      his surprise he saw Uncle Clem.He was going off without bidding us good-bye when perhaps we      may never see him again.  He always was very queer but this      beats every thing.  Is not the war news splendid?  I have      not been so glad since the battle of Drainsville,      particularly about Howell Cobb the old traitor.  There is      now not the slightest fear of our having Stonewall Jackson      in Philadelphia but I pity the poor citizens of Cincinnati.       Cousin Sam Cox was called to a churchthere (St. Paul’s) and he accepted.  He left town two weeks      from yesterday and when he arrived at Cincinnati he was not      allowed to enter the city but was sent to a boarding house      about two miles from the city.  There he is now with his      wife children and father.  Of their furniture they know      nothing and are not allowed to go to the city to see about      it.  Every morning at five o’clock all the bells in the town      ring and every man who is able to carry a gun assembles in      some perminent place and from thence they go out into the      country to wait for the enemy.  Even clergymen are forced to      fight & Cousin Sam is in almost hourly fear of being made to      serve.  I received a letter from Martha Henderson just now.They are at present in Wiesbaden and Martha says that if her      relations were with her she would never again wish to leave      there, not even for America.  That I cannot understand for      no place can or will ever be the same to me as dear      Philadelphia.  But I am forgetting my determination to make      my letter short and although I am burning to go on I deny      myself for your good as I think a little correction will be      very beneficial to you so I will sign myself y
your ever      loving and for long letters begging friend

My dear Sister,

Mother had just sent Sally up with an   epistle from thee to her for me to read and with directions   that as I intend writing to do so this afternoon and say   that she is well and getting along admirably – hopes you   will not feel uneasy about them and not hurry home on   account of home –  Indeed she and Aunt look so happy there   together that thee need not console with her in the least on   account of loneliness –  Mother now can ransack and make and   mend at her leesure and without interruption –  Sister Ruth   with her husband & baby and nurse and I with my ditto ditto   ditto spent one first day with her very pleasantly and since   I have [been] taken tea with her but cannot call very often   to see her on account of family affairs  Harriet is still   with me and doing her best  We still have homemade bread and   a very good table in regard to cookery  I had no prospect   that she could have done so well but I have had to work   quite merrily or I should never have things to get done in   time –  We have a good black boy and Ann Clement has come   and suits very well and now if I could meet with a goodSally in the kitchen I should be better fixed than ever   if thee should see one on the road thee is travelling do   tell her the direction of our house –  I have no prospect of   getting one to suit except indeed a faint one of a girl from   Bridgeton that Harriet knows of –  Several have applied but   I am very particular as I do not wish to change very soon   again –  Laura continues as good as she can be sleeps all   the morning and all night without waking –  She has a cough   now and I am little afraid it will prove to be Whooping   Cough as Ann has some thing like it –  Dr Thomas came   yesterday to vaccinate her and says it is a favourable age   and season to have it –
I am pleased to hear that you are   all well and that you are enjoying your travel so much  I   very much hope that it will prove particularly beneficial to   thee –  Tell the boys I quite long to peruse their   interesting journals.  I hope they relate anecdotes and   retail conversations – tell Tommy I expect his will be   humourous and Franky’s abstruse –  Mary’s no doubt will be   quite correct and modestly written as she is so quiet about   it
How gratified William must be with your visit do   persuade him to fit up his handsome house and get a wife to   take care of it.–  I wonder that the idea should have to be   suggested to himSister Frances in her last letter to me desires me to write   particularly about thy health and Sister Rs and desires her   love to be given.  Is she not a lovely woman?  She is so   intelligent affectionate and sprightly –  I love her very   much –  She says that she would have been delighted if we   had visited her but that now she could not ask us at [a--]   [s--] as her children have the whooping cough –  Mother   Pleasants has gone to New York yearly meeting to be absent a   couple of weeks –  She invited Mother and Aunt M Leeds to   spend the day with her before she went, with us but it   rained and we did not get to go
Nothing new or   interesting here I tell to thee I believe in private annals   and of public events the newspaper will inform –  John   Randolp of Roanoke died day before yesterday at the City   Hotel
Give my best love to brother Henry and the children   I shall be glad to see you home again returning with renewed   health and spirits – that it may be so in the ardent wish of   thy affectionate sister –

Title: 1818 November 20, Stoddartsville, to Thomas P. Cope Esq., Philadelphia

Thomas P. Cope
Stoddartsville November 20th   1818.
Respected Uncle,
From Father from Wm Drinker &   from B.[T]. Case I have understood that Susquehanna County   Has recd from thee a recent visit & also that our   Philadelphia & Great Bend Turnpike was not without interest   in thy sight–
That this Road Should be deemed of   importance By thee & yet not through my representations of   its incalculable Value affords me much pleasure–  Directly   Interested in it myself & anxious by every Honest means to   ensure its success  Still there were insurmountable   objections to my endeavoring to influence Thee in its   promotion–  I hope I need not explain from whence these   objections proceeded – they are inseparable from the History   of my life & my powers of Memory–
On the 14th I proceeded   to Wilkes barre in order to See Mr Henry Clymer- Thomas   Meredith & others and to definitively establish the Route of   our Turnpike – also to nominate Commissioners & to Petition   the Legislature–  without Know[ing] who would or would not   Serve in Philada we nominated the following subject to   alterations if necessary–
Thomas Stewardson – Thomas P   Cope – John Reed – Condy Raquet, Benjamin R Morgan & John   Gibson – for Philada–
Henry Clymer – Henry W Drinker & Wm   Clark – for Luzerne–
Isaac Ryneerson – Thomas Meredith –   Wm Ward & B[T] Case – for Susquehan[a]
A New Route Had   been Explored By Mr B[T] Case to the Westward several miles   of the one contemplated & Explored for Thomas Stewardson –   shorter in distance & less Hilly than the [first] & far more   interesting to thy Estate on the Meshoppen–
after   minutely examining the apparent advantages of the two   Routes. I gave my assent to adopting the one last explored &   Our Petition was Drawn in conformity thereto–
For want of   a Better map of Common Reference I must make use of Reading   Howells map of Pennsylvania to carry to thee an Idea of the   Route though from the incorrectness of it our Road will   appear more crooked than it will be eventualy found–
Our   Road begins at One Matts Tavern on the Coskectune and Great   Bend Turnpike Towards the Head of Salt [Lick] Creek – where   the Road from Tyoga Point crosses the said Turnpike –    Thence across the Milford & Owego Turnpike – & thence   between Martins Creek & the North Branch of the Tunkhannock   Creek–Thence across the South Branch of the same – & Thence   through Leggets Notch (or Gap) in the Lackawannock Range of   mountains [Formed by Leggets creek a small stream pretty   into the Lackawannock about 15 miles from the Susquehannah   according to Reading Howells map & scale] then across the   East & West Road at one Swartz Tavern – & then across   Roaring Brook or Deep Hollow Creek – Thence nearly Parralel   with the Same to the main Branch of the Lehigh River–    Thence S. 10 E across Tobyhanna Creek & its Branches to the   Sullivans Road & thence by the East End of the Large Pond to   the Turnpike Road on the top of the Pokono mountain at or   near the 30 mile stone from Wilkesbarre–  The whole Distance   Being from Point to point as Explored & measured about Fifty   Three miles – & the Estimated Expence $1000 per mile–  Our   Petition asks the Legislature to incorporate a company with   a capital of $75,000 – but entre nous this is but a [Ruse de   Guerre]–
I do not pretend (from my imperfect knowledge of   the precise situation of thy lands upon the Meshoppen) to be   able to say How far thy interest may be advanced by the   completion of this Road But that it will be more or less   appears evident and plain –  That the Whole of Susquehanna   County – a Part of Luzerne Co. & a part of Pike will feel   its Blessings is not to be denied–  Neither I think will it   be doubted that the Road is interesting to parts of   Northampton – Bucks & Montgomery counties & as will be shown   Peculiarly Interesting to the City & county of   Philadelphia–
We have called it The Philadelphia & Great   Bend Turnpike & with good reason.- it forming the most   Important Link in the chain of communication & the only one   wanting to secure to Philadelphia incalculable advantages–    From the Pokono a good Turnpike Road now Exists (not Log   Turnpike) to the Wind Gap & from thence [are] two good   county Roads to Easton – on to Bethlehem by the way of   Nazareth – or to Janets Bridge in Lower Saucon where a   Turnpike Road is laid out – then by good Roads to either the   Willow Grove or Germantown Turnpikes  to the City of   Philada–.  We might Have called our Turnpike The   Counteracting Turnpike – it being the Only one Ever   projectedcalculated (By Intersecting the Turnpikes Leading to the   City of New York in important points) to counteract the   Influence that City by Her Liberallity Her Geographical   Wisdom and foresight in despight of natural obstructions –   Has obtained–
There is One advantage which will result to   Philada from this Road which (amongst many others) I select   Because it will reach the comprehension of Every man & is   capable of undeniable proof & is indeed Known to very many   persons in Bussiness in Philadelphia–  I speak now of the   Cattle Trade or the Driving of Horned Cattle Sheep & Horses   to the Philadelphia market–  I shall speak of such Facts as   are Known to me – some of which are Known to our Dry good   merchants – some to our Graziers and all to the Drovers   themselves–
The persons Engaged in this Trade are nearly   to a man Store Keepers from the state of New York–  They   receive cattle sheep & Horses in payment for various   merchandize sold by them to farmers in their vicinity.  Or   purchase them with the monies they Receive for their goods–    Their Best market for these cattle is found at Philadelphia   & notwithstanding the circuitous Route they are obliged to   take & the most miserable & wretched Roads which alone Exist   to this market they Drive Annualy cattle sheep & Horses to   the amount of One million of Dollars– (I [think] this season   of Horned cattle alone that near if not quite 1/2 a million   of Dollars in value Has passed By this place & through the N   & South Road  at least I am persuaded that I may rely on the   account I have Received of the number) – if then it be a   fact that near one million of Dollars in cattle sheep &   Horses reaches Philadelphia Every year from the State of New   York and that for want of a Road from Philada- to the   Western part of that state – the whole Sum is Drawn in cash   from Philada and goes to the City of New York & there is   Expended in the purchase of Merchandize Because of good   waggon Roads Connecting that City with the Said western part   of the State – will it not be apparent thatOur Road in Truth is a Philadelphia Turnpike & well Worthy   the Patronage & Support of every liberal minded Citizen–    But that this is the fact Every Drover will admit & I   beleive that they will very generaly declare that they would   much rather purchase their merchandize in Philadelphia than   in New York if it were possible to waggon [their] goods   through Pennsylvania to their Homes–  at least this is the   Sentiment expressed to me as far as I have conversed with   them – in addition Then to these facts – I may state That   Though Cattle forms perhaps a principal Remittance from   Store Keepers in the Western pt of N York–  Yet it is not   the only One – a good deal of Cash also is brought Down by   these persons & this cash also goes to the City of New York   which would if our Road was made Remain in Philada–
I may   State too without fear of contradiction that this Cattle   Trade in despight of Obstacles Has constantly & rapidly   increased that in spight of them it will increase & that if   nothing is done to Counteract the Evil we shall still   continue to pay to the City of New York for the Beef we Eat   – or in other words that the Philadelphia merchant. shall   continue to pay the New York merchant for the whole amount   of cattle Driven from this quarter to Philadelphia–  an   Enormous Annual Ballance Indeed for this one article of our   Consumption – again – This Highly Interesting Section of the   State of New York – [is] Hourly increasing in Wealth &   Importance – in wants of Foreign articles & Resources of   Domestic Wealth – And let me ask where can the merchants of   Philadelphia Find a Body of such customers as exist Here –   where Such a certain& constant Trade–  Where such an increase of Trade where   such certain remittances–  Presenting also at Least one   Million of Dollars per annum Being Drawn out of the City at   this Time & How much Hereafter it is not possible to   predict–  This However may Be reasonably [assumed] as a fact   – that if such now is the amount of this Trade with all the   difficulties which want of Roads present – a good Road will   very materially increase it – in [----] to Enumerate the   advantages to be reaped by Establishing a Free communication   with this Most Fertile Section of New York would more   properly form a Volume than suit the limits of a Letter– Yet   I may add that This Cattle Trade – though in itself of no   mean Importance to Philadelphia is only One amongst many   Valuable Blessings which New York has taken from   Philadelphia By the Superior Foresight of Her Citizens –   There it Has been Esteemed Honorable & not unworthy the   attention of Her first merchants to Examine in to The   Internal Resources of Her State as well as of Her Sister   States – whilst the [reins] of Philadelphians Seems to Have   Been almost altogether Turned Towards the Sea – to Maritime   ports & Latterly to the Great Western Waters–  Yet what   assisted to raise Philadelphia to Her present prosperity &   Rank more than all other Things was the Internal resources   of Her own State & those Sections of other States within   marketable Reach – and it is only as these Blessings   multiply & Have facilities given them to Extend to & Support   Her that She can on any Just grounds expect to advance – If   this possition is True & if I Have notfailed in making good my ground of the Vast advantage of communication with a Section of the State of New York to Philadelphia is not our Road in Truth a Philadelphia Road & entitled to the Best wishes & aid of that City–   in the Magnitude of the Advantages to Be reaped from the State of New York through the Medium of this Road ??? I must not loose sight of the Trade of our own Counties which also at present for want of Roads lead[ing] to Philadelphia likewise goes to the City of New York ??? The amt of this I Have not the present means of ascertain[ing] But it must be considerable & is rapidly increasing??? The Coskectune and Great Bend Turnpike & the Milford & Owego Turnpike are striking at the Best Interests of Philadelphia??? New York City is By these Roads Establishing to Herself a Course of Trade which Though Now Easily Diverted from Her to Philadelphia is growing every day more & more difficult ??? a Timely Exertion an application of one mite of the Vast money Resources of Philada at this time in aid of this apparently insignificant Road will do more than the Expenditure of much Greater sums on Seemingly much Greater undertakings   Our Road will cut the Milford & Owego Road & the Coskectune & Great Bend Turnpike in so delicate a part that the whole Eastern Section of Each will be benumned & rendered lifeless ??? Their object (the secur[ing] the Trade to the City of New York)will be effectualy Counteracted & Defeated – & The Proverb   Be good to Philada – “One man Sows & another reaps the fruit   of His Labour”–
I have gone into a length of detail &   [-----] reasoning that I had not contemplated & I fear Have   tired Thee as well as myself.–  I crave forgiveness for my   fault–  I nevertheless would be much pleased if Thee Should   Think a Publication of Any of these Views – Couched in   different Language and Respectfuly dressed would in any way   be of advantage to us in gett[ing] through with our   important Road – for though I have made it appear that there   is abundant Riches to the West & North West of us & more   wealth than foresight in Philadelphia  Yet the fact must be   told that We are miserably poor – & that unless the City   aids our Road it may Be as long as Troys Seige before it is   Travelld–
Now if Thee would undertake the Herculean Task   of Picking the marrow (if there be any to be found) out of   this Long [map] of writing – Dress it & Suit it to the   palate of our Philadelphians & Serve it up to them in a News   paper I should Hope that it might in time of need possibly   aid us in Subscriptions to our Turnpike Stock –  This   However I leave to thy Better Judgement–
My Best Respects   to Aunt Grandmother & my cousins Generaly remain[ing] as   Ever affectionaly

Newport Oct 9th  1864, 1st day morn

Dear Sister–
I   recieved thy note (for I cannot call it a letter because it   contained so much nonsense) yester-day morning; but I did   not say poo! because I had an idea it was from Rachel or at   least hoped it did not contain nonsense.  I was glad to   recieve such information as thy note contained, & thought it   was a great compliment to be called handsome by sombody,   although I do not think father was much complimented by   having his hair called an iron gray color; unfortunatly I   did not lose my heart with her, although I think I must have   seen her & was very sorry I could not go to meting but my   knee was not equal to it.  I could have found some time to   write to you or thee butI have been very lazy since I have been here.  I delivered   thy message to Father (about Dr Thomas) but fear he has   forgotten about it, so I will remind him of it & now I must   close for I am getting lazy & will tell thee what we are   doing when there is some thing to tell about of more   consequence.  I believe Mother intends writing a   P.S.
Affec thy brother

P.S.  when I   said you on the first page near the bottom I meat Rachel &   thyself.  TP Cope Jr.

I am sorry there should be any   mistake about Dr. Thomas  I thought I told you, you would   have to send him word when you were ready to begin  You had   better tell him of myabsence from home so that he may understand why he was not   called on before.  So much for that - the burden of my   [----] is “painting.”  It is the burden on my mind & must of   course show itself in words.  Uncle Tom sent me word that he   had expressed a sample of color which Craig has prepared for   our inspection.  I suppose we may get the package tomorrow –   but what troubles me is the delay – Craig said he would have   it all done so we could come back the 20th.  If he has got   to put on two coats after he hears from us I fear he will   not be ready for us.  We are getting tired of this plan &   anxious to know whether there will be any difficulty about   getting intoour house on the 22nd.  Seventh day week - We have to engage   Staterooms two weeks before to get good ones & I intend   tomorrow to engage them for 6th day the 21st & if you find   the house cannot be got ready by that time you will please   send us word at once so that we can disengage the rooms.    Perhaps if Craig can not get all done & dry he can have the   kitchen & back passages finished & if the last coat is on   the parlors &c we might come in before it is dry–  I feel   sorry to have filled up Toms sheet with nothing but such a   message – try to do better next time.  It has been blowing   strong from the N.W. all day & is cold as charity Alf &   Hazen went to meeting with me in the morning & your   [br]other in the afternoon but its dull work here either   at the larger or smaller body Yankee self conceit shows   nowhere more.

Dear Sister Rachel

We had so uneventful a journey, I have been so quiet since our arrival here, that I have scarcely material for a letter. Travellers are expected, I believe, to be particularly entertaining. Now, there is no time when I feel less so. Fatigue, change of air & diet, always for a time, affect my health unfavorably; and then, the turmoil & bustle scatter the little wits I possess. So that, from home, I am an especially stupid correspondent. Still, as you were kind enough to wish to hear from us, and as we exchanged promises about writing, I will not wait for any thing worth saying, --as I may not have it at all, thee knows; -- and my delay may occasion me the disappointment of not receiving here, the speedy return letter from Fourth St, which is to be my reward.-- 

We had quite a pleasant time so far as Trenton, for our first day's exploit. We arrived there about half past five o'clock; and George with our baggage, via. steam-boat and rail-road, very shortly after. In the evening, we made a little visit to Elizabeth Gummere, who lives near the Hotel. They have a fine, large house, in a pleasant part of town, & express themselves, the young folks, most emphatically, pleased with their change of residence. As we were in the immediate neighborhood, we went with Eliza..th, to spend a few minutes with our old friend, Judge Gordon's wife. She looks and seems just the same asI recollect her in the days of my childhood. So it appears that in this bustling life, there are some not easily jostled out of their way. We found the Judge, some years ago, busy with his attempts to sell his map of New Jersey. It still seems a most interesting theme to him; & if we come this way six years hence, I dare say he will even then be ready to speak of its merits & to state that his stock is not yet exhausted.-- Fifth day night brought us within twelve miles of the mountain, and the next day at noon, we reached the end of our journey--and over such roads! I was thinking, perpetually, of the children's song "Here we go up, up, up, & here we go down, down" &c &c. To adopt little Cary's favourite style, the rain had washed such gulleys in the roads, & the stones were so bare, & there were so many of them!-- 
The first two days after we got here, we had three or four showers per day. By way of consolation, we were told, this was a favorable specimen of their weather this season. For the previous ten days, it had rained all the time. "Recorder [Vaux?]" who is here, calls it temperance weather. I wonder if [Espy] is a tee-totaller.--We were beguiled , when we first came, into taking a room in "the cottage" Its superior dimensions, privacy &c were warmly insisted upon. And as we like plenty of room, and don't like much noise, we thought it quite a prize. The sun shone so flatteringly upon the [compact?], that we never thought of the inconvenience of being drenched in going to our meals, or having them drenched  in being brought to us. As we have now had ample opportunity of trying it both ways, and don't relisheither, we begin to murmer. Coming in search of Health, we fancy too, that a sleeping apartment on the ground floor is not exactly the place to meet with her ladyship, this damp summer. We have some of the inconvenient "[Fine-ear]" family, moreover, next us, who have been very near getting us into a scrape. A grand-daughter of John Jacob Astor has been stoping with a Mr Kane, from Albany, and, under what her friends consider, very aggravated circumstances. They came here to spend the Honey moon, & unfortunately, were placed in the room adjoining ours. Job related to me, one day, in a confidential tone of voice, the history of their flight, as just detailed to him by Governor Coles. This they contrived to over-hear, & being displeased thereat, they imagined a series of questions and answers,-- Job & I being the speakers,-- about the pedigree, personal consequence &c of many of the boarders, which they carried directly to the individuals about whom we were said to be so curious, & from there, they came immediately back to us. Happily, they fixed upon people whom we knew perfectly well, & thus the absurdity of our asking who they were whom we had known all our lives, was sufficiently apparent, & created only a little merriment. But we were somewhat annoyed until we discovered the full extent of this eaves-dropping. Thus, the storms without, & the treachery within doors, have given us a thorough distaste to this part of the premises. Besides, there is more of a crowd than we wished to get into, & if the company does not diminish, we shall want to try some quieter region. Direct, here, however, as we shall leave instructions for letters tobe sent to us. -- We have had it very warm & almost clear now for a couple of days, & have been enjoying it by driving about. The country is sufficiently beautiful to render the slow climbing of hills by no means a tedious affair. The roads are kept in quite tolerable order, & occasionally, we come to a level piece of ground where we trot away quite merrily. People tell us wonders about the flush gained and the disease lost among these hills. I hope our cases may add to a reputation, so richly earned, according to all accounts. -- I should write to Caroline, but I am not a very disinterested letter writer; sowing only where I may hope to reap, --& I fear she is scarcely yet at home.--I should like much, to know how you all are, where you now are, & where you are to be for he next few weeks.--Does thee know where Father & Mother are & when Cara returns? When do you go to Susquehanna [---] & how are Anne's eyes? Tell her I have not seen a single cat since I left home; but we have plenty of little ducks & chickens, the feeding of which is a daily source of amusement to the children. I heard them complaining this morning, that the older ladies were interfering with this, their peculiar privilege. Indeed the belles and beaux seem to find it quite as entertaining as they--remember, my dear R, that thee is bound to procure me a letter, in some way. Either from under thy own hand, (how is it?) or from one of those to whom thee can say "do this & he doeth it." If thee is not well enough, I shall calculate a little, too, on the affection & kindness of my nephews & niece. I do not know whether it will be any thing of a bribe-but I always make it a point to answer letters addressed to me--some time or other. If I should not

 Although I neither gave thee nor any one else a [----] of writing, yet having an idle hour on hand I do not know how to employ it better.  We kept the stage from Philad'a to Harrisburg stayed half a day in Reading & a day & a half in Harrisburg.  As we were informed that it would be impossible to procure a place in the stage without waiting at Harrisburg a week & probably 2 weeks, we in company with two others engaged a hack to bring us to this place.  The expense was no greater than the stage hire & the travelling much more agreeable.  We lodged in Carlisle which from the last we had of it appeared to me the neatest place we have passed through upon leaving home.  We arrived here the next day afternoon.  It commenced raining just as we entered the town & continued with little intermission during the next [---].  On fifth day morning the clouds were broken & promised fine weather.  We accordingly determined to cross the mountain to McConnell [-] if it were possible to procure a chair.  Our landlord discouraged us so much from attempting it in that manner that we determined to try it on horse back.  What dost thou think of Henry's riding in the saddle to the distance of 21 miles & returning the next day over one of the highest mountains in N. America.  It was his own determination for I really was afraid to encourage it.  The experiment however succeeded to admiration & we are here again without hurt or damage.  We had a noble prospect from the top of the mountain.  We both kept journals which will serve to give you some account of our proceedings.  Tomorrow morning at 6 o'clock we are to leave this for Hagerstown.  We travel more like express riders than pleasure hunters.  We had intended to have procured a gig in Harrisburg and visited the cove on the [S-----} but this we found impossible.  In these things I am not disappointed.  They are what I expected and are incident to our mode of travelling.

My dear father

To prevent any anxiety which you may feel on our account, I embrace the first opportunity which offers since our arrival to inform you of our welfare.  We arrived at Newcastle on 6th day evening about 7, supped there, went on board the packet-boat at 10 & got under way about two in the morning.  During the day the wind was light & generally ahead.  At twelve last night we were within four miles of this, when the appearance of the weather indicating a squall, we were obliged to come to anchor.  We had a pretty severe thunder-storm from the n. [--] but not accompanied with much wind.  It was however, sufficient to alarm our [-------] a good deal & make them all very sick.  William & one other gentleman had a slight attack which sent them on deck; the rest of us experienced no inconvenience.  The storm did not continue much more than an hour, & by five this morning we anchored within half a mile of our landing place.  A boat immediately put out to us & conveyed us safely to shore, under a pretty high swell.  Four miles riding in carriages brought us here an hour before breakfast.
We found the house nearest the water completely occupied.We have taken lodgings in much the best home in the place at the distance of something better than a square from the shore.  I have walked it once & tho' farther than I should like I hope it will answer.  My knees are no worse, but having returning from my first bathing I can say nothing as to the effect of sea-water.
I send this by my friend Wm. W. Austin who sails tomorrow morning with the packet.  We both [-----] our love to all the family.  You will either see us or hear from us again at the end of the week.

My dear brother

I wrote father on the day of our arrival by Wm. Austin, and mentioned that if we did return I should write again by the end of the week.  Although as respects the article of pleasure I am entirely satisfied, yet I have concluded it would be prudent for me to remain a few days, perhaps a week, longer.    The party I came down with, all return tomorrow; should I return with them, I shall have been here but six days & have bathed but five times.  This can hardly be called giving the water a fair trial.  Thus far I do not know that I have received any benefit; some of our boarders tell me they think I walk better, but I am myself sensible of no change.  We board much farther from the surf than is agreeable to me, but it was impossible to procure quarters in the home nearest the shore.  On the whole I do not much regret it, as our accommodations are much better than can be had in the other houses.
The party we attached ourselves to, engaged a large room with a bed for each and a stipulation that while we occupied it no others should be admitted.  This party consists of Merritt Canby, Jos. Askers, Ellis Yarnall, Robert Barnes, (a brother to the doctor) Richard Nixon a young englishman, and a very clever fellow & our two selves.  When they are gone we shall shift our quarters into a small apartment.  With respect to the employment of our time, it is sufficiently monotonous, and I fear next week will be still duller.  This however applies to myself.  Those who are well find employment enough in gunning, fishing, walking &c.  I was one of a fishing party to-day, which as it will form  one of the most memorable events of my excursion, deserves to be noted.  The packet boat, General Jackson has a day to spare here on each trip, & to-day she engaged to take as many as chose to go, out to the banks to catch sea-bass.  A more delightful day for the excursion could hardly be conceived.  It was neither too hot, too cold, too windy, nor too calm.  We were unfortunate in but one particular, and that a main one.  We found no fish.  I was among the most fortunate and caught three.  One whole stock amounted to about four dozen.  At our greatest distance we were nearly out of sight of land; our fishing place was near twenty miles from shore.  William was afraid to go for fear of sea sickness.  As all the rest of our party went, and I was fearful he would be sick myself, I did not urge him.  I begin to feel quite sailor like, as respects this said sickness.  I never felt better in my life.  A few of the party were very sickand several others complained.  Jos. [---] was the most severely handled of any person on board; he was really ill.  The most unpleasant part of our expedition was landing through the surf on our return.  We landed in a whale-boat, which was brought down pretty low in the water, by the weight of her cargo, consisting of twenty-three persons.  We rose safely over the surf till our prow touched the beach, when it broke over the stern, rocked us very much & shocked several.  Jos. {----] had his hat knocked off & was amazingly frightened.  McAlpin, the [-------], in riding to shore on the shoulders of one of the boatmen, upset, horse & rider.  We were unpolite enough to laugh a good deal, but he bore it with the greatest good nature.
We shall certainly not exceed our two weeks here.  If the water is at all beneficial to me, I shall be sensible of it by that time.
Our best love to father, mother and all the family.

My dearest brother, 
Would thee be willing to buy us a basket of peaches on 7th day morning and send them down by the 2.10 trian marked Francis Stokes borrowings, via Perryville- Hannah craves some very much and Dr. Sappington says she may eat a little. They are not to be had here for love or money. Thee can pay for them out of the money thee has of mine. 
Poor dear H. does not seem to improve much & her spirits have failed, soshe is quite down-hearted. She comes down-stairs in the evening but has not strength and no appetite- & is right wretched. 
I wish thee could come down on 7th day & spend 1st day with us. We would be delighted to see thee & would not keep thee in her room. The maids are improving, Sarah is a sitting up and I think Mary will be able to do so tomorrow. 
Esther returned this afternoon looking well and rosy. She will be a great help & Edith feels quite made up again. 
I don't see any prospect at all of my going toNewport and if there is any one else to take my place I hope you will invite them. When Hannah does get better I think the sea-air would do her a great deal of good and I hope build her up, and I know in your kindness you will set an open door before her. It is a great disappointment to Franky but perhaps he can go with her. It sounds very presumptous in me to write all this but you are always so kind and cordial it is apt to make us ['"fresh"]. 
It grows late & I must stop, with warmest love thy K.5th day morning - Hannah seems weak this morning. we had rather a disturbed night, for a water-spout and the closet leaked & Frank & Esther  & I were [bobbing] round in a very [-----] manner. It reminded me of a our experiences one night when the was down here- 2 1/2 inches of rain fell in less than 2  hours. 
Frank says that very nice peaches can be got at the corner of Market & [Merrick] right near the depot. I don't know how much they will be but I suppose $1.50 or $2.00

Dear Mother.

We are now in Watertown and expect to stay here for dinner, when we will take the train to Clayton, & go from there to Alexandria Bay by boat.  Uncles & myself have just been to look at carriages but we find that they do not make any two-wheeled carts, so uncle Tom & myself think thee had better order the cart from Bradly without delay.  Uncle Tom expects to go home to Philadelphia nextMonday or Tuesday & uncle Edgar & myself will probably remain two or three days later.  It is pretty hot in Watertown, nevertheless uncle T & myself have been going around the town buying fishing tackle.  I must stop now as we are going in to dinner.  Affec.ly. thy son

Dear Mother,

Thy lettters seem to have come to the right place at the right time, as I have received them all I think.  I am very much discusted at the delay about ordering the wagon.  I can not see but what the two-wheeler is not as safe as a four-wheeler.  At any rate the two-wheeled cart is much the lightest and easier to turn if you should happen to get into a tight place; but the main advantage is that they are lighter, & as we have nostrong horse suitable for the girls to drive, I should think that we had better get the two-wheeler.  If you have desided pretty much not to get the cart, I think you might as well get a light buggie something like thine.  Thee will have to deside now or never if we are going to get it this summer.
The hotel where we are staying now is a very fashionable place, & there is not much fishing or anything else to do.  Yesterday we took a lovely steamboat ride along the Canadian shore & among the islands.  It was verypretty indeed as all the islands on the Canada side belong to the government & are very wild for nobody is aloud to build on them.  Now we have seen the islands there is not much to do, so we intend to leave here tomorrow morning & take the boat to Kingston and from there to Cimcoe Island where the fishing is said to be very fine.
I got a very nice letter last Friday evening from Grandma saying that  Grandpa was going on toNewport, as uncle Thomas was coming home from Berkshire.  Uncle Tom thinks of taking the boat from Cimcoe Island to Toronto and then coming home by Niagara.  But he has not desided certainly about it yet, partly owing to the strike at Buffalo.  If he does that I shall return with him as I may not get another chance for some time.  If uncle Edgar likes the fishing at Cimcoe he will probably stay a few days later.  So thee sees there is nothing certainly desided about coming home.  Uncle E thinks he may stop atTunkhannock on his way to Overbrook and try the fishing in the Susequehanna.  I will return any how by the 1st Sept., and will try and let thee know the day before, when we are coming.
Tell Ellie I will try & right to her soon.
Affec'ly thy son
Francis R. Cope Jr.
Uncle Tom thinks we had better get the cart and try it, and that there need be no danger if we drive carefully.
Uncle Tom sends is love to thee.

Dear Annie,

This is the first sheet of that ream of paper, but for fear thee should be appalled with the anticipation of having the whole of it filled up to thy account, I am going to tell thee in the first place that I ai'nt going to be quite so unconscionable tho' I wont promise how I far I shall short of it.  I thought maybe you would like to know something about my gettings along on my journey, so I will begin at Pottstown up to which place you are informed of what transpired.  Well after taking the last look at you, I turned round & felt a little forlorn at finding nothing but my carpetbag to keep me company, so as I had nobody to talk to (I was very glad I had'nt) I thought I would occupy myself with thinking about you & wondering how you were getting along.  Directly after we started we came whizzing past a train of cars, which I supposed were the ones wh. were to convey you back to Philada.  I was very glad to see them because I knew you would be & I was afraid you might have had to wait there a good while, but it was'nt very pleasant to think that we were speeding away from each other as fast as we could go.  I hope you did'nt feel as [worn] & dusty when you got to Phila as I did when I reached Port Clinton I had'nt much time to think about it however for I had to go quite in traveller like style & superintend as well as I could amid the bustle & din the transportation of our baggage from one car to another, that seen to, I joined my companions & weput ourselves on board the cars for Tamaqua, a ride of two hours brought us to that place about 1 o'clock, there we staid about half an hour most of wh. time I spent in trying to restore my face to a decent shade of color, for I found it in the funniest looking condition thee can imagine, the dust, & the tears occasioned by the cinders, (& something else) had covered [skin] spots with a sort of black paste wh. very much resembled mud & wh. I had some difficulty in removing.  I thought it expedient to [see first] watering place to get out & wash so I performed my ablutions quite comfortably under the spout where the horses were drinking, it reminded me of Aunt Fortunes style of face washing.  The ride over the mountains was just about as usual, except that it was a little bit hotter & dustier & disagreeabler than ever.  We had 9 passengers in the stage not counting carpetbags & blanket shawls wh are an important item in hot weather I hope I have left mine for the enjoyment of somebody who will take a cooler time for it.  We lived all the afternoon in the anticipation of a cooler ride after sunset, but it seemed to grow hotter instead of colder, most of the passengers seemed to forget their discomforts in a nap so I was left to my own entertainment & sat very quietly in one corner thinking about different things among others I amused myself with imagining what you were about at, Oakland, & wishing I was there with you instead of where I was, about 11 1/2 P.M. we were wheeled up before the Phoenix Hotel in Wilkesbarre where as soon as possible (tho' not until morning) we made our way to our sleeping apartments mine did not prove to be much of a sleeping apartment however tho' as much as could have been expected of a roomwithout windows & with featherbeds, they were very full at the Hotel & we were obliged to be content with the kind of accomodations we could get.  Thinking to better my condition I got up the next morning at half past three & found it a decided improvement upon lying in bed We left [W] about 7 o'clock & had a pleasant ride thro' the valley of Wyoming, it is by far the pleasantest part of the journey I think, the country is looking beautifully now, only it was too hot to enjoy it.  We reached Tunkhannock about 12 1/2 PM, & now comes the very dismalest part of all, at this place the two lades with whom I had travelled from Phila & whom I knew very well left me unexpectedly, & I was packed without any ceremony into a kind of open arrangement upon wheels (for it hardly deserved the name of a wagon) & after considerable crowding & pushing, & groaning I managed to squeze in between two fat women & an indiscriminate collection of trunks, & handboxes, & men.  Under these auspicious circumstances we started, the sun basking down upon us in one direction, & some ominous looking black clouds in another, so [hot] I scarcely knew whether to wish most for a drenching or a coo[k]ing I an addition to this the driver was entertaining us with all sorts of awful predictions, he said the roads were terrible, that the bridge had been washed away & he expected we would all be drowned in crossing the creek, & as to his horses he was perfectly certain they never could stand it, & so I thought I shd never get home in the world, that something awful certainly could'nt fail to happen among so many dismal predictions, & they were such a queer set of people, & altogether I felt such an utter sense of forlornness that I eddified them by beginning to cry.  I was provoked at myself for being so foolish but I really could'nthelp it, it did'nt last very long however, for directly one man who seemed to quite pity me turned round & said in the most compassionate tone, "you feel kind'er used up do'nt you."  I was so struck with the applicability of the expression (for in truth I did feel a sort of sense of "goneness") that I began to laugh, & seeming quite pleased that his efforts were so successful, the man set himself to work to entertain me during the rest of the way, he said he always kind, o' hated to see people discouraged, that he never got discouraged in his life & he thought it was'nt a good plan, & so he got me into quite a composed state of mind & I was enabled to bear the rest of the journey with a tolerable degree of calmness, it is well disagreeable things come to an end as well as agreeable ones, thee may imagine how delighted it was to be safely landed at home after all this, without being either drowned or drenched, they were quite surprised to see me arriving in such a forlorn condition.  If Father & mother had known they wd have met me at Tunkhannock.  I believe the reason of our having such a miserable affair was that the stage had broken down the day before, & this was all they had to send.  They are all very well here excepting father who is somewhat stiff yet with the effects of the rheumatism, the children have grown very much.  And now that I have almost filled my letter with an acct of my own doings, let me ask thee about yours.  I want to know how you are getting along, it seems ages since I have heard anything about you.  I do hope thee'll write very soon & tell me about everything.  I feel somehow as if I was farther away than I ever was before, do come up this summer if you possibly can, any of you, we shd be so delighted Mother requested me to give her love & tell you so.  I suppose whether you remember'd our agreement for last night.  I did & thought about it too.  I suppose Julia is in Reading.  Please give a great deal of love to Uncle Henry & Aunt Rachel, Cos Frank & Cos Anna, Cos Thos & Cos Elizabeth & all the rest of the cousins, to Grfather of course & every body else to whom thee sees fit.  Of course thee will write to me [very] soon.  I am at the end of my paper & must conclude, thy affectionate Cos Clementine CopePS. I gave such a dismal acct of our proceedings up here that I am afraid it will not be any encouragement to come, but let me tell thee that things ai'nt always at such a forlorn pass, it only happened to be so at that particular time.

Dunbar – (a young man of our religious denomination-   somewhat diligent attender of meeting – (where He in company   with the majority of our young men occupies the seat   fronting the women friends – pardon the digression but the   fact is worth recording that as the Mahometan prays with his   face towards Mecca – thou canst draw the parallel) not so   much distinguished as would be best for plainness of speech.   [behavi] and apparel – and inheriting with the rest of us   some failings I fear from Father Adam - ) who is to pass   thro Philada. on his way to Haverford and then to France in   a New Lock Haven packet next week. – A poet moreover and   somewhat unique personage. & can either roar like a lion or   a sucking dove at his pleasure – rhyme to the moon or swear   like a pirate. – I don’t know how long he stays in Philada.   but if you fall in with him you’ll know him.

The   greatest attraction in these parts this winter - & which   must take its share of the blame of having kept me from   attending to my Philada correspondence is a new periodical   entitled “L’Entreprise” which has originated among us and   has claimed a goodly portion of my leisure
The great   charm about you must know is that we have Lady contributors   – Gertrude Hussey “Murray” quondam –
with sundry & divers others – too tedious to mention as the   advertisements would say – with a respectable lot of   Quak[er] lady make considerable of a coterie. – 
Dr Hardy   undertook to join but whether he did not succeed [to] his   mind or whether his practice is too extensive & laborious to   admit of his wasting his time so idly I know not – but he   has not yet contributed – This much however must be said of   him whether through his intrinsic merits or accidental   circumstances he has in fact succeeded in getting into an   extraordinary practice and seems likely to settle down here   and live easy. – Ah!  Francis if I were only as goodlooking   a young man as thou art I should then think that Destiny had   cut me (too) out for a Doctor
Ben Hardy’s whiskers were   always irresistible – but a new bobwig which I find I had   the honor of bringing home from Philada. in one of those   boxes you remember – that new bobwig with the [portage] of   which I was so unconsciously honored – that new bobwig is   worth a thousand dollars a year to him – 

The old   gentleman that was at our house a little while since from   Salem – gave us a few particulars in Ben’s history that will   be useful to any one who shall hearafter have the honor of   compiling his biography – It seems that such was his   enterprise and such too his earnest zeal in the laudable   task of pleasing the women even in early life that after   having studied the art of Crispin in his nativevillage of Kennebunk he was at the pains of a journey and   long residence at Lyme to be initiated into the art &   mystery of making woman’s shoes

How instructive the   lesson that such heroism and model-gallantry teaches –   Frank! that mans life is a lesson to all posterity – Raised   very probably on a [shingle] in that bleak [-egion]   described so emphatically by the poet – 
“Away down East   dere
[Clow] [by] de moon”
then as he grew up from   [clouts] to petticoats from petticoats to breeches to trace   the ardent aspirations of a full soul. – panting after   greatness and distinction. – from the time he first drove a   peg to the time when he last [drove] a peg – still his   potentialities are visible [from] germ to perfection and   full maturity of cobblerhood. – Ah!  if I were only   good=looking enough!
One sin of commission too I must   confess & be shrived of – As I was turning over some old   papers of mine the other day – I accidentally opened an old   letter of thine containing “a Serenade” [which] being   forthwith tempted by the Devil I inserted in a forthcoming   no. of my periodical – Now I am of opinion that the   temptation proceeds from that source because unintentionally   I find I have eclipsed myself altogether I having “done the   poetry” in that [line] till now finding that I shall not be   able to write anything as good myself why “Othello’s   occupation gone”. – 
and I shall be obliged to cultivate a little taste & genius   which I flatter myself I possess [as] “dea[t]h is [shocking]   accident – and suicide Songster.” – By the way I have begun   a pastoral

“Jocund lambkins softly warble” which when   finished shall be forwarded for your criticism and another –   
[Thus] fair brow thoughts richest mine
When thy   bright as diamonds shine
Rivalled only by the glow
of   the bright orbs below – there’s a [touch] for you –   

Remember you dont pay any postage for this letter   
So it is no matter if it is not worth anything
very   sincerely yours

      My dear Frank,      

      I rec'd thine & Chellie’s letters to day, when Tho's came out from town.  They also had one from Mary, and we are glad to hear of your safe arrival at Snow Shoe and very thankful I am, that you had a doctor so near at hand to extract the bone from thy throat.  I read thy letter first, and was much alarmed. before knowing what the accident thee alluded to was, but Thomas fortunately knew about it from Mary's letter & told me at once.  What a providential thing it was, that there was a Dr. so near at hand.  the children must have been very much frightened, before thee was relieved.--I hope thee will be careful of thyself, and not jump, and injure thy arch again.—
      -
      attached wife Anna S. Cope.  I hope Tom is provided with warm under-clothing.  Mary sends her love & hopes you will have a good time.I hope thee has enough warm clothing, with thee, for I sh'd not be surprised of thr warmest weather is past.  We are having it delightful here at home, the thermometer 68 this morning at 8 o'clock and under 80 at noon.  This afternoon Thomas & Elizabeth Mary & I called at father's, and afterwards at Ellis Yarnall's leaving Mary at father's.  We found them all at home, and had a very pleasant visit.  Lucy Harrison is very bright & agreeable & Anne is lovely.  She told me she had written a note to Lillie, which I would send to her when it comes to hand.  She also told me she was sorry not to go to Snow Shoe with you, but they could not go to Chicago, & as their time is so limited they of course felt anxious to see as much as possible before going home.  they expect to go to Detroit from Chicagoand then on to Niagara.  They expect to leave sometime next week, and take the journey alone.  We all disapprove of them taking such a long journey by themselves, but I suppose Ellis Yarnall will find out some one to look after them.  When they go on, they expect to spend the first night at Altoona, and then travel day & night until they reach Chicago.  I have sent Lillie & Chellie some under-clothing.  2 flannel skirts, 2 under vests, 1 cloth body, 2 pairs thick stockings, 1 pair drawers, 1 [Alpaca?] skirt.  Anna & Carrie are quite well, & the former is invitee to spend tomorrow with cousin Mary [W.?] Brown's little Mary.  I did not [?] like [?]-ing her just now, but could not well decline.  I was at father's this afternoon, and they were all pretty well.  father seems stronger from the change in weather.  I saw bro. John and his boys go off this morning, and hope they had apleasant trip to Altoona.  I am glad you met with such a polite reception at Bellefonte.  I had no idea before, that there was any such spring of water, there as mentions.  63000 gallons a minute is immense.  I think you must have enjoyed the ride up the mountain very much, if the views are so beautiful.  Give my love to Lillie & Chellie, and tell them I hope they will not be put out at my sending them some warm clothing, as I am only sorry they did not send for warm dresses too, as they have nothing warm with them.  It is now bed-time and I must put by my writing; the children are enjoying Anna Hartshorne's company very much.  I hope some of you will write tho' I do not want you to tax yourselves.  I have already been much favored.  Bro Thomas intended sending sister Anne's letter, but it was not returned from Aunt Ruth's in time.  with much love to you all, ever thy

      Frank has been writing to William this morning, and has most likely advised you on all points of interest.- you probably know by this time, that we are all in a good state of health, and we hope that our sister Susan is improving, tho' she still has some head-ache.  Frank & cousin Wistar are very kind and devote themselves almost exclusively to contributing to her comfort & pleasure in every way.  F is devoted to Susan and does evey thing in his power to promote the improvement of her health, his kindness is unparalleled: everything is done for us, and we have nothing to do, but join in the pleasant plans laid out for us.- Elizy H & Susan were concluding before dinner, that they accomplished very little of any thing on account of the time occupied in changing their dresses for the different labors of the day.- About ten in the morning they prepare for bathing or rather we do when Susan does not go-
      /
      not arrive on 7th day tho' we intend to do so if possible.  the Boat did not leave until 5 o'clock this morning.  I expect the irregular lately.- with much love
      aff thy sister Anne
      Susan will accompany us to Hazard's this afternoon
      she is resting since her bath.then return about 12 o'clock.  rest, until time to away for dinner, then about 5 o'clock, a different costume must necessarily be adapted for Sailing especially when the boats, are slightly fishy & a little dirty.- then we come home about ten-time or little past, and another change must be made to appear at [---] which [---] will suffice for the evening.- but all this is done in a good hurry and I cannot say it consumes much time.- I believe I have nothing new to tell thee, and indeed, I expect it would be very puzzling to think of any such thing when Cousin Wistar is of the party, for he writes home to frequently, and describes every thing that seems with so much minuteness, that if you are favored with the perusal of his epistles, ours must seem quite commonplace; this is my conjecture, as we joke Wistar & Sue both, about writing so often.- Only to think- Sixth day evening we leave, if a storm or fog does not prevent us, and Tom has concluded to remain, and return with us last evening tho' fog was so dense that the Bay-State" did not go out, and now we have every prospect, of the same thick state of the atmosphere for this evening consequently.  it seemed hardly worth while for Tom to leave before we did.- The Massachusetts arrived here with Mr. Williams on board, about 11 o'clock thismorning having been lying off Point Judith, even since four o'clock.  Susan & Lizzie went to bathe this morning with F & Wistar leaving me at home to pass the time as I could.  Tom & Moses had gone fishing, and I was quiet enough.  Susan though it best notwithstanding your message, to try the [---] three times faithfully as the Dr directed, and I hope she will not be any worse for it, and perhaps it may strengthen her afterwards.  She says she likes it very much while in the water, but she feels pretty weak for sometime afterwards.  we think she is the best judge for what is best for her, and she does exactly what she wished in the Bathing line; Frank takes her in, giving her three waves as directed, he said the water was very warm & pleasant this morning.  I quite long to go in again but fear I shall not have an opportunity of going more than once or twice more before I leave.- It suits Elizy Hacker exactly, she feels a little tired after coming out, but it seems to brance & strenghthen her, and shee looks better I think in this little time of our [---] here.  I do hope her father will telegraph her to remain with Sue, if the letter does not arrive in time to answer it before our leave.- yester afternoon we were out Sailing in the bay, landed on one of the [dumpling?] rocks gathered some sprigs of green to press, and enjoyedthe novelty of it highly, it was really very pleasant, altho' by the time we returned, our blanket shawls were almost white with the fog.  Sailing seems to suit Susan, very well, but I think clear weather as a general thing is preferable to her.- This afternoon we think of calling at fr'd Hazard’s, we spent a pleasant evening there last Sixth day.  they are certainly a delightful family. Ann[a/e?] Hazard called here this morning with S & A Jenkins who are still staying with them – we intend riding out to see fr'd Jenkins before we go.- 4th day morn.  I was obliged to leave this shut hastily yesterday afternoon, as Thomas Hazard & his wife called upon us inviting us to spend this afternoon with them which we intend doing.  Elizy & Frank are much disappointed I believe in Fanny H’s beauty, but they must see her at [---] before they fully decide.  She is perfect at home.- my love to all- Susan and Lizzie are taking a nap before dinner, and I cannot disturb them now.- there is a thick fog over they bay now 12 at noon, and it will [---] increase- Tom could not have gone last night in consequence of the bay as the boat did not leave, and perhaps it is as well for him to wait for us.  Frank & myself do not think it proper to leave here in a fog or storm and Tom must not think it strange if we do

   When I last wrote, it seemed so doubtful whether thee would be at uncle William's or on the way home with Edward Biddle, that I concluded to direct the letter to Clemmy in case thee had left there.- Brother Thomas returned home very unexpectedly on second day evening, the very time we were looking for thee, he was much overcome by the voyage, and the anxiety of getting off in a steamer, but I hope is better now,and likely to improve; his strength has been much prostrated, and he has had some fever but the Doctor considers him better this evening, and he does really seem better, tho’ he is still quite weak.  They had a very cold voyage, and he could not keep warm enough & consequently took a severe cold, but thee must not be anxious or uneasy about him, as Dr Rhoads thinks him much better; &he is entirely free of fever this evening.  Alfred is also much better to day for the first time, but he has changed so frequently from better to worse in the course of twenty four hours, that we hardly know how to calculate about him.  But I think the Doctor is more encouraged about him this evening, and I have great hopes that he will soon be on the well list, as he has one tooth through, and he has not coughed quite so hard to day; the rest of the family are all pretty well, father, and mother desire their love to thee, and say thee had better take the first good opportunity to return home, and not to think of coming home alone, without hearing further from us; and Francis also adds that in case Alfred continues better, perhaps he can come up for the next week.-
   With regard to thy medicine, and salve, we will endeavor to send it to thee in some way, as well as the material for aunt Susan’s duster.- Bro' Thomas has bough various little articles for the children, with which they are much pleased; he bought Lilly & Chelly eacha suit of doll’s clothes made in Paris, according to the present style, hats shoes, and even night-gown and cap.  velvet [---] watch & chain, little [---] all furnished in the most minute style, [---], &c little beauties,- the children are so overjoyed, that they show them to everyone that comes, and do not get tired of examining them, at all times in the day, and I do not wonder for they are so elegantly made that you cannot help admiring them.  Sister Elizy and Julia sed their love to Clemmy and thyself, in which I wish to join, also love to Aunt Susan, Annette & Carry- I am sorry I have no news to tell thee, such as thee would like to hear, but as I have not been any where for the last three or four weeks thee must not wonder at it.-

   I am obliged to close this in haste, as it is late, and the family have mostly retired
   mother is about as well as usual now.-Tom continues to get better- whether I get up for thee or not will depend on how Alfred is.  He is a good deal better this morning.  I have Aunt Susans cloth which if I do not bring up I will send by envelope.  There seems to be no use of sending thy medicine as thee will hardly have a chance to use it, but I will bring it with me if I come. Dr Evans is not in town now

   My dear sister
   
   When I last wrote, it seemed so doubtful whether thee would be at uncle William's or on the way home with Edward Biddle, that I concluded to direct the letter to Clemmy in case thee had left there.- Brother Thomas returned home very unexpectedly on second day evening, the very time we were looking for thee, he was much overcome by the voyage, and the anxiety of getting off in a steamer, but I hope is better now,and likely to improve; his strength has been much prostrated, and he has had some fever but the Doctor considers him better this evening, and he does really seem better, tho’ he is still quite weak.  They had a very cold voyage, and he could not keep warm enough & consequently took a severe cold, but thee must not be anxious or uneasy about him, as Dr Rhoads thinks him much better; &he is entirely free of fever this evening.  Alfred is also much better to day for the first time, but he has changed so frequently from better to worse in the course of twenty four hours, that we hardly know how to calculate about him.  But I think the Doctor is more encouraged about him this evening, and I have great hopes that he will soon be on the well list, as he has one tooth through, and he has not coughed quite so hard to day; the rest of the family are all pretty well, father, and mother desire their love to thee, and say thee had better take the first good opportunity to return home, and not to think of coming home alone, without hearing further from us; and Francis also adds that in case Alfred continues better, perhaps he can come up for the next week.-
   With regard to thy medicine, and salve, we will endeavor to send it to thee in some way, as well as the material for aunt Susan’s duster.- Bro' Thomas has bough various little articles for the children, with which they are much pleased; he bought Lilly & Chelly eacha suit of doll’s clothes made in Paris, according to the present style, hats shoes, and even night-gown and cap.  velvet [---] watch & chain, little [---] all furnished in the most minute style, [---], &c little beauties,- the children are so overjoyed, that they show them to everyone that comes, and do not get tired of examining them, at all times in the day, and I do not wonder for they are so elegantly made that you cannot help admiring them.  Sister Elizy and Julia sed their love to Clemmy and thyself, in which I wish to join, also love to Aunt Susan, Annette & Carry- I am sorry I have no news to tell thee, such as thee would like to hear, but as I have not been any where for the last three or four weeks thee must not wonder at it.-
   with much love affectionately
   sister Anna S. Cope

   I am obliged to close this in haste, as it is late, and the family have mostly retired
   mother is about as well as usual now.-Tom continues to get better- whether I get up for thee or not will depend on how Alfred is.  He is a good deal better this morning.  I have Aunt Susans cloth which if I do not bring up I will send by envelope.  There seems to be no use of sending thy medicine as thee will hardly have a chance to use it, but I will bring it with me if I come. Dr Evans is not in town now

Title: 1875 July 4, Lake Windermere, to Tom & Scrubby

Lockwood Hotel   Lake Windermere
   July 4. 1875
   
   Dear Tom & Scrubby.
   
   I did write a few lones to thee Scrubby from Kendal but I rec'd such a nice letter from thee last Fifth day that I concluded to send thee a longer one; & as I have already rec'd two letters from Tom I thought it would be well to kill two birds with one stone-so here goes-We saw the first of this lake last Fourth day afternoonand will continue to see it till sometime tomorrow.  I haven't the slightest idea where the picture, at the head of this sheet, is taken from;- but I know one thing & that is that I have not as yet seen anything like it nor do I think that there is such a view.  At any rate it gives you no idea of the place.  Now for the narrative- We took a row on the lake soon after arriving here & on Fifth day took the steamer down to [Bowness?] where we expected to get on a carriage & drive over to Coniston.  When we arrived there, however, the sky looked so threatening & Alexis not feeling very well we concluded to leave it till next day, & returned to Louwood.  Arriving in a heavy shower we were at a loss to know what to do, till I decided to go over to Keswick & get our letters that were probably awaiting our arrival there.  So as the stage did not go till 3 o'clock I drove over to Ambleside, bought a full rubbersuit (coat leggings & cap) hired a horse & started off, about 1 o'clock.  You can imagine me clothed in these things sitting on an awfully rough trotter nothing of my usual self being visible except my eyes, nose & mouth, and my shoes.  The suit answered admirably, keeping me perfectly dry in the hardest thunder-storm I was ever out in- Except my shoes wh. in a few minutes were rather soggy.  However it was soon over & I arrived at [Derwentwater?] Hotel, [Portinscale?] at 4 P.M. having ridden on horseback 19 miles.  Here I obtained, first a lunch then the letters, one from each of you.  While waiting here another gust came up & when it had gone over the sky looked brighter & more settled.  So having engaged rooms for 2nd day, at 6 P.M. I set off & had a most beautiful ride past [Thirlmue?] & Helvellyn, Grasmere & Rydal Water back to Ambleside wh. I reached at half past eight.  Drove downto our hotel, took some red-hot tea & then went out to hunt for Lilly & Alexis, whom I found spooning in a bench & who told me that there were three other pairs in the hotel worse off than we were.  Sixth-day we set off for Coniston Water, driving alongside of Windermere & crossing below Bowness, through Hawkshead where Wordsworth went to school & finally reached Coniston where Lillie & I made the tour of the lake in the steam Gondolee as they call it while Alexis ascended the "Old Man."  We had the best of it for, although he immortalized himself by leaving his name & address in full on top of pole of stones which has been placed there, yet he was caught in such a dense fogthat he couldn't see anything & in turn caught a species of chill & fever, from which he is slowly recovering.  Yetserday we went through Grasmere & Rydal & got Lillie pretty well played out.  We rowed down Grasmere Lake & walked to Rydal Mount, (wh we did not see, exceptone window & the chimney's) Lillie & Alexis "preferring rather" to keep on a level while I crossed over the hill from wh. I got an elegant view of Windermere, Rydal Water, Grasmere & [Tharlmere?] besides some small 'towns' and the mountains on all sides.  On coming down I overtook Lou & Alexis spooning by the roadside, On my coming up they had began to talkpleasantly about the weather, Lillie suggesting that it was much cooler than the 3rd of July 2 years ago, at wh. both looked remarkably pleased & mysterious.  I looked very innocent but on making "comparative mathematical calculations" have concluded that it must have been that day they drove over from Connymeade together & took two hours & a half (2 ½ hrs) by the watch to get up to the house from the stable-   

   It’s fearfully hard to get Lillie up in the mornings.  She grumbles incessently because Alexis & myself will order breakfast at half past eight & uses as anargument to the statement, (I wont say in fact) that Father when he was over here did not breakfast till nine.  Another instance, Tom of the force of example.  However we dont give in & in revenge she gener-ally keeps us waiting 15 or 20 minutes.  Alexis thinks it is a good thing that we travel from place to place, as they must think wherever we go that it is a mere accident that we are late.  This miserable climate dont seem to suit me very well.  In the first place the voyage knocked me, clean; for I caught cold some how wh. increased my sore-throat & I haven’t got rid of it yet.  It steadily increased till I got to Warwick wh place seemed to agree with it; for it has been improving since.  Then I had a boil on my skin which troubled me not a little when I ran against anything or Alexis hit me with his umbrella.  I have got it down to a pretty fine point now however & one is coming on my backjust between my shoulders so as to afford me an opportunity of displaying my skill in twisting my arms around.  Beer dont seem to be the thing for me at present, & I have hardly tasted it since leaving Liverpool.  As to the roast-beef, it tastes very much like the same article at home, and they put so much mint with the peas to make them green I suppose that you cant taste any thing else.  But the great charm is that every thing is so nice & clean- no greasy knives &c  You must excuse this writing; but Lillie brought us out here on a most uncomfortable hill-side & insists on sticking it out.  We saw some very pretty little ponies when we were in Wales Srubby; but as we are carrying very small valises & they are pretty full we thought best to defer our purchasefor a season.  I commenced writing on this sheet as you may see but Lou thought it was so important to write on pictured paper that I gave in- Consequently the above marks- I hope that Hazen may succeed in getting up his party & also that he will not ruin the horses driving too much in the park.  I have just thought of a little map wh. I have in my packet wh. I shall enclose in this letter with 5th and 6th sdays excursions marked on them.  Although it may not interest either of you I think mother will like to see it.  I will now cook as it is time for me to be poking Lillie up to go down to dinner,

Title: 1880 February 8, Cannes, to Alexis

Cannes Feb. 8. 1880.
   
   Dear Alexis,
   
   We recd thy letter of Jan. 16th a few days since, & have been thinking over thy proposition.  It wd. be nice to be able to spend part of our summers in Susquehanna Co particularly if you make it your home, but we have not been looking forwarrd to keeping house in our return.  I do not want to live at Connymead again, (indeed I do not think any of us want to; unless we cd. find some one to live with us)  It was too lonely, particularly for me.  & if we did not keep house there in winter, we cd. not keep very well keep house in summer.  How or where we shall live when we go home, I do not know.  Indeed the uncertainties of the future, & what it will be best to do, often weighs upon my mind.  Connymead is no placefor any body to live who wants to be a Friend, or who has any preference for their ways.  Life there was a continual struggle wh. I have no desire to renew, & perhaps we shall never know again [ever/even?] that semblance of a home.  I hope if thee and Lily picked to bring your children up as Friends, you may be able to keep them in a community where Friends live.  For it is pretty hard for a young person who has been uninstructed in what are considered the accomplishments of life to have to live where these are considered all important, & are the chief recupations of those by whom you are surrounded.  It requires a good deal of strength of character to be able to live alone, I [---], & Friends must always do it more or less when they go out from among their own people.  When one has not been brought to play on the piano or sing or draw, or paint, or evento play cards- a not very valuable accomplishment certainly- & yet one in wh. English people who are both intelligent & sensible, seem to while away at least a fourth part of their waking hours; & never to tire of- When I say, one has never been instructed in any of these things, one feels as if one ought to be at least where they are not the chief employment of life.  Of course when living in a delightful pension on the Riviera- one is not supposed to be exactly fulfilling the normal conditions of existence- Existence here (the physical part of it) seems too delightful to be long continued, & I have wonder since we have been here how long 14 human beings could live together, without apparently a shadow of sorrow or anxiety to disturb the delightful days, which seem, to glide away without a cloud either inward or outward, to mar their peacefulness such skies, & such weather , & such walks as we have- only one littleshower in all the two months we have been here- It is the most perfect thing in weather certainly, that we have ever experienced.  If we had come last winter we shd  not have had the same experience of it, for it rained very much even here.  But I have digressed widely from the subject upon wh. I intended to write, [---] the old house of Woodbourne.  Whatever may be my inclincation with regard to it, (& I certainly shd. like very much the idea of being able to live somewhere near you).  I do not thonk C & A have any desire to undertake housekeeping there.  The life of a travelling artist- or even of the traveller, minus the artist- in these delightful regions & pensions where have all the comforts of home without its cares, does not intend to inspire you with a desire to renew the contest with the [biddy?]- in art less America. If only some plan cd. be devised by wh. Woodbourne cd. be converted into a pension.  I have no doubt we shd. spend a good deal of our time there, & shd. think the old house wd. need an immense amount of repairing, & as to the old chairs of the Conklin family, I feel as if I had lost my interest in them & I shd. not think they wd. be worth the sum they mentioned.  It is provoking to have to buy what is your own.  (see 4th page of A's letter)Can thee tell us who paid the drivers on our Naples [---] wh. were packed in the same box with P.C.G.'s- we asked thee to do it & I suppose thee must have- but we have never heard.If not paid
   
   Please pay to the order of Francis C. Haines (who may be too modest to speak of it) 9 francs 15 centimes, as near as you can come at it.

Title: 1880 March 21, Hotel de la Paix, Rome, to Lily

March. 21. 1880.
   
   My dear Lily, Behold us in Rome once more!- dear delightful bewitching Rome- The city of cities- I cannot tell with what delight I find myself again threading its labyrinths & wandering amidst its ruins.  We reached here the 6th of March, having left Mentone 2 days before, passing one night in Genoa & thence by the midnight train to Rome.  This being the only train (owing to their very insane & uncomfortable arrangements) wh. gets you here at a respectable hour.  It was a very uncomfortable journey- but then we were coming to- Rome!!  We made a sojourn of two weeks only, at Dr. Müllers- Mentone we thought lovely- Dr M’s house not altogether so.  It is not happily [---] being at the end of one of thos dried up rivers, down wh. torrents of cold airrushed from the mountains.  We thought it much colder & damper than either Cannes or Nice.  & then there was a slight suggestion of boarding school about the household arrangements- & most for much open warfare between the Dr & his spouse to be altogether agreeable.  It is a great pity they have not learned to control their tempers a little in the presence of their guests at least- for at times it was rather to peppery to be pleasant.  Fortunately the storms seemed to be not very lasting.  & they were generally jolly enough- & in fact much more jolly then most people would be who were at their wits ends to make two ends meet.  A lady who was staying there with her family (pretty much as a matter of charity I fancy) told me they were over head & ears in debt & that she had come to the conclusion there was no use in trying to help them, as they never cd. keep any money- altho' they ask a very high price for their accomodations.  The excursions at Mentone were truly lovely, & the Dr. was alwaysready to take us.  In fact we thought he quite preferred the ladies to the boys for he seemed quite put out once or twice at our declining to go.  but they were too hard for me, & I did none of the very long ones.  I shd. think however for those who were up to that sort of thing, Mentone would be one of the most delightful of the Riviera towns, tho' each one of them seems to have its own peculiar charms.  The weather was very warm when we got to Rome, & took the back bone out of me terribly- It however soon changed from mild, to cool, clear & bracing & the last 10 days have been delicious- I never was able to do so much walking in Rome before, & on spring afternoons such as these what luxury cd. be greater than to drive or to wander at will among the ruins all golden in the light of the declining sun- or to watch the funny old models in their gay rags & tatters- (wh. seem to [---] the spirit of the twins-) hanging themselves out on the Spanish Steps to be admiredwith all the rest.  Surely there is no place on earth like Rome.  Last first day was the kings birthday & there was a grand review- & the king & queen & the [---] kindly [---] themselves , to our admiring gaze in the Borghese. It was quite too gay & disappointing to be proper for 1st day.  The usual ceremonies of holy week begin to day, wh. is Palm Sunday.  We did not attend at S. Peters, thinking last year it was rather a sell.  I went to the little Italian [Waldensian] Church, a great contrast indeed to the pomp & [---] of the great Cathedral.  We had got back to our old Hotel della Pace, where we were twice last winter.  We went first to another but did not like it, & so came here, where we found some friends of last summer (the Müllers).  It is a good central situation.  We look down upon the Piazza Barberinni & the old Tritan who is always blowing his stream of water into the air, & then catching it again all over his head & back wh. must be pretty well washed in all the years that it has been trickling over him.  Then on the other side of the street2
   
   is the Barberrini Pal.  & sad eyed Beatrice.  By way of variety the other day we went to one of Miss Brewsters receptions.  It was a kind of afternoon tea fight, of [---] & other distinguished persons like ourselves.  Tea, wine, & talk & many beautiful things to look at.   

   Next, we want to go with her.  Forbes the archaeologist to hear tge Forum explained on the latest authorities.  His explanations one said to be intensely interesting.  In fact Rome is so dissipating- there is such an infinity to see & to read & to learn that it is most distracting.  I hope we shall be here three or four weeks longer at least.  In fact it spoils you so for every thing else that it does’nt seem worth while to go any where afterwards.
   
   I ought to have told thee before, how glad I was to get thine & Agnes' letter at Mentone.  I was greatly struck with the advance of the latter's ideas since her first epistle wh. I have carried ever since, in the pocket of my satchel& wh. was composed mostly of kisses.  I see she is now advancing to the doll & the baby house interests of the little girl-hood.  The way the ideas were put together was very amusing- & the circumstantial acct. of the flight of the nurses & the changing reigns of the lady’s of the nursery very graphic.  Give her a kiss, & tell her Auntie has very much obliged for her letter & thought it very interesting.  Also that she must’not cut any more holes in her apron with her little scissors, but must make some nice little paper dresses for the paper dollys that Aunty sent in the letter.   

   22nd.  Just returned from our excursion to the Forum with Mr Forbes- two hours rummage amoung the ruins- intensely interesting- back nearly broken- head ditto.  General conglomeration of podiums, Tabulariums, demolished temples & roman emperors- but quite worth the 4 francs wh. is the price per head at wh. Mr F. deals out his information.  He has been on the spot for some years & actually seen & superintended the excavations- so of course knows a great deal about it, & sees it in a very interesting way- much more so than [Hare?], who is a dreadfully guide booky old fellow I think- Am too tired to write more   

   Please tell Alexis that the letters of credit came a few days since, & we are much obliged for his attention to them.  Love to all.  Tell Cousin Anna I am going yo ans. her letter as soon as I can find time.  Thy affectionate Sister

Geneve No 5 Chemin de la Tour. 6.14.1880
   
   My dear Lily,
   
   I expect Caroline will give me "Jesse" as the saying is, if I presume to enter on the stage with her.  Nevertheless as she has occupied the floor for some weeks past in thy favor, I think I shall dare to add a note, tho' she tells me it must be short & upon no account much upon Revenna.  Wherefore conclude she has been expending herself on that ancient & delightful city- & forbear.  Thy letter of-- containing the childrens photographs came tohand two days since, & gave much pleasure.  We think thine, with little Eleanor, is the best of thee we have ever seen, & as to the little E I shd. say she was her Mama in miniature just as little F is his Papa over again only with a few shades more of jollity in his face.  What a sweet little good natur’d  happy kissable face it is & tho' I believe we have understood that he was'nt particularly fond of the latter operation, I doubtnot he has to undergo a good deal of it, & he does'nt look as if he wd. be very refractory under any circumstances, Indeed such a nice little jolly face must be a great comfort to look at, &, I need not suggest for Mamas to be proud of.  I suppose when we get home thee & Alexis will be a grand old couple, sitting up in the middle of your flock, looking very wise & experienced, as you contemplate with "majestic pride" the youthful scions growing & flourishing about you.
   
   I don’t see that thee has a very care worn air however in thy photo-graph.  but on the contrary one might suppose that they cares & worries of domestic life were quite [---] & pleasant.  by what you say I shd. think the heat must have been of that nature wh. wd. have a tendancy to drive you to seek for a cooler clime.  For my part I dont see the use of undertaking to live in such a climate at all, as the chief object of life seems to be with most people to get away from it.  Why not try to live, as I said to the Awbury people yesterday, where such fearful agonies wd. not have contin-ually to be gone thro' with in order to try to effect an escape.
   
   I am very sorry for Madjy's disappointment as her letter to us showed that he hopes were very much set on Europe, & she seems to need some change so much.  It is a great pity they have to undergo such alternations of hope & despair, because they have got [---] on the living side of the Atlantic.  At least it seems to be the side wh. is very much below par with most persons who inhabit it judging from the frantic manner in wh.they rush for the other shore.  The papers say that pretty much Ole America is now on the way to [---].  We concluded that the pleasure to be derived from seeing the play, wh. I think wd. be but doubtful at best, wd. be very much spoiled by the crowd of cooks & other tourists who will infest the country. We therefore have chosen to spend some time insteadin Geneva in French family No 2.  Not that we were disappointed with our experiences in No 1, but that we fell very much in love with this family last fall, when we took some lessons of them.  They are more cultivated people than the others- consequently moreinteresting, & tho' less well off- they are still friench, wh. means that they are practical & know how to be comfortable on a little.  We only pay about half as much as we do at the large Hotels, with more real comfort, beside the very good advantage of hearing the best of french spoken.  The lady has two sons, one a professor in the University & one a clergyman, & two dhrs. all highly educated.  The advantages of the education here for those in moderate circumastances are so very great.  We shall stay probably a month or more until the weather gets to hot wh. does'nt seem very likely- as we are on pretty high ground just outside the city with plenty of green trees & alps in profusion in the distance.
     
   My advice to you is to come & build a cottage on one of the hill sides of Geneva, instead of Woodbourne & get a Savoyard maid as we have, who with her mistresses aid does the work for a household of 9 persons.  We have two dinners daily, of several courses & very well cooked, & how in the world they do it all I cannot conceive.  I suspect that Madam is at the bottom of a good deal, but she does it all with such apparent grace & ease, that one cannot suspect her of cooking.  There are beautiful building lots to be bought here, by the way, on the high ground along the town with the Lake on one side & Mt. Blanc on the other, & there are many beautiful gardens & suburban residences- wh. are quite unseen & [---] by the mere passing traveller.  If it was’nt for those children of yours whom we want to see!- I shd. be quite tempted to invest in one of these little spots & settle down for the rest of my days.  Will thee please ask Alexis to inquire of cousin FRC if he rec'd a letter fm. me posted June 8. containing a cheque for $200.  I also posted one on the 13 June to M.S.C. containing cheque for $100.  As there is some risk of these things being lost shd. be very much obliged if A or some body wd. advertise Provident Life & Trust Company of [---] and [---]. of these two cheques payable to the order of the above mention’d persons.  Hoping soon to have news of you in a cooler clime & under Mrs. Hotchkiss' hospitable roof.  Ever thy affec- sister C.  Ever so many kisses to dear little Agnes & to theothers as for as appreciated by them.

Is it necessary in order to effect a division of our property (I mean such a division as shall give thee thy portion at Connymead) is it necessary that I return to America in the Autumn with C & A, as it has been our intention to do, (or at least theirs)?  For myself I have not entirely decided, tho' we have partly paid our passages for the 6th Nov. in the steamer "Illinois", on condition that we can change if it seems best to another vessel of the line.  It is late to sail, but there seemed to be no good steamer between the first week of October& the last, & as there will be no moonlight the last of October we thought it wd. be best to wait until the next moon.   

   There are many reasons why I shd. like to return in the Autumn, but the prospect of boarding in Phila is not very attractive, & of keeping house at Connymead still less so- indeed I shd. never be willing to undertake the latter again unless circumstances were very much changed.  C & A prefer the former.  If they were willing to keep house or even to board near Germantown, where we could have the enjoyment of the children, I shd. come home with the greatest pleasure.   

   But this I expect they will never wish to do.  So that until I can think of some way for me to live in that part of the world.  It seems as if I might almost as well stay here- for boardingin Phila wd. not be much better as far as you are concerned.   

   The thought of staying by myself seems a little dismal, but I cd. stay very well in the family where we now are & be as well cared for as I cd. expect or wish to by, by strangers.  Then there is an elderly lady (whom we have met several times (& I think have spoken of) Miss Wetherill, Jno. Price Wetherills dhr, of Phila) who has asked me to join her party, consisting of her niece & [Pebers?] of Phila.  We were with them 8 weeks in Rome & found them very pleasant.  So I could stay very well if I wanted to- Tell me how the idea strikes you, with regard to the business- as, if my presence is necessary to the accomplishment of it, that wd. decide the question.   

   We still continue in Geneva & still continue to like exceedingly our french family.  We intended in coming, to stay a month & then go to the Mts.  But the weather has been almost too cool for anygreat heights, & this, so far (I dont know how it may be in August) seems a happy medium.  We have had a few warmish days, but for the most part it has been a delightful summer climate.  Then too we have had so much gadding about, that we enjoy the quiet & the thought that we are learning something.   

   How often I wish I cd. have Agnes here for a few months.  It would do for her, what years of study at home cannot do for any body.  I never knew before how badly, or rather how little we had been taught at home, how to pronounce french.  Then too this is such a nice family where it wd. be so safe to place a child.  Their ideas about education are good- & they have so much simplicity in their ways & manners- they seem almost like those of friends.  The children have never been allowed to go to the opera or the theater- tho' they have one, within a few doors of them.  Every evening before going to bed, we have a little "culbe"- Madam Duproix reads out of a big bible- & then makes a little extemporaneous prayer- so very simple, that one cannot help but feel as if it came from the heart; After this, we separate for the night with much hand-shaking and many "[---]" & "[---]" & "[---]" &c- The great objection to the french is that they have to say so much about every little thing & are really too polite for comfort.  I think each person at the table says "par-r-r-don"- about 50 times at each meal (with a very great trill to the r- & a very great accent on the last syllable) if all this wasn't accompanied with real kindness of heart (as in this case) one wd. become "very fatigued" of it.   

   We suppose that you are now at Montrose tho' we dont know it.  It has been a perfect age since anyone has written from Awbury.  I sent cous. FRC a letter containing a cheque about5 weeks since & having rec'd no acknowledgement fear it has been confiscated, or that he is not well.  We are anxious to hear how you perform'd the journey & how Montrose goes.  Netty is writing to Lilly as I will not write now 
   
   with much love to her & the children

   My poor dear blue Brother
   
   Sister E has just bee reading thy letter to Chelle dated Woodford 9 mo 8th and I am very sorry thee gets so down in the mouth, and could wish I had been along with thee- provided I was wanted and could have done thee good, not that I would place myself before some others Lilly, Chellie, &c, but then maybe thee would not have felt me so much on thy mind, as I think I should have been pretty easily contented even if I did have to stay pretty close by old London.  I would have at least been a "flesh & blood" companionand not one of the ancient curiosities the guide books introduce thee to.  Not to say how much I would have liked to have been along on my own account, and the many little bits of intruction I would have picked up by the way, Well!  not wishing to assume too much I thought maybe I would have been better than nobody.  But when it came to paying call on the Hartshornes and the like, thee might have left me behind, the grandees and I, I fear would not get along very well together, some of them at any rate.
   
   Well would thee like to know what we are about at home.  Brother T at present in scouring vigorously at our new plate glass windows which have justbeen inserted into our front door, sister E has settled down to reading after one of her daddy long-leg excitements, whilst the children are settling off to bed except Ellie, whom Lilly got to come down to your house to tea, Chellie being over at her Grandfathers, while Alfred, and Frank took tea with us, Here they come Lilly, Virginia and Dr Hartshorne as escort, Perhaps thee will scarcely think it worth while for me to write all this.  Sister Anna seems to be consulting various books, following thee in thy travels, she was showing me a picture of- let me see- the old wall of Portsmouth, which thee speaks of in one of thy letters, and this evening she is inquiring for "Old England."  Yesterdaybrother J and wife, with myself took an early start for Wilmington, to pay one of those stated visits to Hannah Richardson.  It was a lovely day and we had a very nice time, and thyself and thy movements were among other topics spoken of.  In the cars that morning I had quite a little talk with James Cox, who also was inquiring after thee, and though absent thou art not forgotten.  I do hope thee found Ellis Yarnall and party on the Continent- and has enjoyed thy trip, and hope it will do thee good, I really fear thee will not get near all the good of the trip we would like, when thee gets so worried, try to look beyond the present difficulty, and think perhaps it will come rightin the end, and then thee will be sorry thee had taken so much trouble, and not gathered more good by the way, And even if it dont turn out what you wish, there are so much greater troubles, that I would have thee try to brighten up.  I dont want thee to finish up with typhoid feaver, this sounds most too bad dont it?  But I hope by the time this reaches thee, thee will feel quite brightened up, with thy trip on the Continent &c.
   
   5th day the 26th.  There has been quite a gap in my letter, the time being taken up in various ways, This morning was meeting morning and a very interesting meeting I thought it, S Emlen addressing the children, and in the course ofhis discourse told an interesting incident relating to a little girl who died lately, and who I suppose was little Mary Rhoads, Charles Rhoads daughter.  I suppose sister Anna told thee of her death, she was only sick 24 hours, and taken insensible almost from the first I believe.  Mary Haines spoke of her as having been a child of the Saviour for a year past.  Samuel Morris followed S.E. in a solemn prayer for the "parents", I think we sometimes have our best meetings on 5th days.  After meeting I went to Aunt Martha's to dine, and have some conversation with her in regard to Eugenia & Samuel, who are now here on a visit.  Aunt Constantia is very anxious S should not return to Washington and we think it veryimportant he should not, but be placed at some boarding-school.  Lilly & Chellie have just come up here, & also brother J and sister M.  Chellie's tongue has been going pretty much like a bell clapper ringing for [fire].  -that last word is fire- thy daughter has been joging her old aunt's elbow, which must account for the above appearance.  General Sheridan comes to Germantown to night, Gtn is coming on.  I suppose he will make quite a stir.  And Gough is coming too [---]!  I have tried to write in the fashionable style of crossing the page but alas!  I have not succeeded.  I hope thee can read it.  Sister Mary says give my love to Frank.  What would thee think of seeing her [---] down by the banks of the BrandywineHer visit there seems to have made quite an impression on her, she goes from home so little, and sees so little of the rural, small things make quite an incident in her quiet life, but the Brandywine is pretty fair for all.  I have not told thee yet how much surprised, almost shocked I was by thy letter to me at E-town telling of thy intention of starting for Europe.  it was so utterly unexpected, and then I was so far away from you, and could not ask what thee had gone for, except I knew it was on business, and then I would have liked to have taken a more affectionate farewell of thee, it had been such a hasty one when thee left Elizabethtown.  We had a very nice time there, Clemmie improved very much I thinkthough she has some cough still at times but it was of very little account, if it had not been for her previous attack.  We visited John Brown’s grave amongst other places, and I have some maple sugar for thee from his place.  I hear sister A and Lilly are both writing, but it is impossible to find a time when there is not some one writing to thee.  So should my letter come in at the little end of the horn, may it at least prove to thee that thee is affectionately remembered by thy far distant but loving
    
   sister Ruthanna
   
   If it should come in thy way to procure an Irish [poplin?] dress for me I would be glad to have one, if they are not too very high, dont get it if over $4.00 per ydI send a pattern of the one I have had, a most excellent one, I would like a dark gray or mode shade, but without a blue or pink shadow in it, my present one has blue in it.  or I would like a pretty brown, but dont take any trouble about it- There may be a kind not-quite-so heavy & expensive as this pattern would be

He will of course incline to be principally among friends, while in your Country, & I shall feel much gratified by thy making him known to some of them.  He is an exemplary member of the religious Society of Friends, & will be found worthy of their regard.  I need scarcely add how much I shall be obliged by thy kind attentions to him-

   We have at last my dear son been favoured to hear from thee- thy Letters of the 21st 1mo having reached us 2 days ago- that is one to Henry & one to William.  These are all which have as yet been recd-  Much as all of us have been gratified to learn thy safe arrival at Madeira our pleasure would have been greatly increased to have some assurance of thy health having been improved.  We hope for the best & are thankful to find thou art spending thy time so agreeably- far away from the troubles which surround us on all hands- Our country is indeed in a very portentious condition.  Genl Jackson seems to be determined let the consequences be what they may, to crush the Bank of the United States.  & such is the foolish nay mad devotion of his immediate partizans, that they are as determined to support him, reckless as to the future.  To day we have a message from our Governor, to the Legislature, announcing the failure of his attempts to borrow money.  & labouring to throw the blame on the Bank- besides the injustice of this charge, he appears to be but little aware of the effect this will produce on money lenders at home & abroad.  Who are [---] thy set, & will be alarmed with fears that the state may not be able to pay the interest of its vast debt- Had he posessed the manliness to recommend the recharter of the Bk public confidence would at once have been restored, & with it the facility of borrowing.  He contemplated the stopage of the public works- Who will then be able to calculate the public loss?  There can of course be little or no income, & the works themselves must be injured if not ruined.

   Dear Henry
   
   From thy letter of yesterday I perceive that doubts still exist as to the apprehended piracy- & the papers which reach us are full of contradictions & vain conjectures- at one time we were assured that the informtation had reached Norfolk about the same time it reached N Castle- & after that statement had passed current for some days we find by a Balte. paper that the first knowledge they had of it in Norfolk was the 25th in the afternoon.  The pilots if I recollect first reported the capturing schooner to be full of men & black sided- it now seems they kept so far away that they could not see whether the ship was bright sided- still they alledge to have distinctly seen the cross in her foretop sail- This circumstance is the most striking, & yet it is possible that at their distance they might be mistaken even in that.  I observe a story has been circulate in NYork of an oyster boat having supplied the ship at Sea- & that is believed, contradicted & reiterated- If that were true it wd. indeed be some comfort, as it might accot. for the whole affair, making some allowances for discrepancies.  It is altogether a painful subject, & has caused me much perhaps useless anxiety.  but no benefit can arise from despondency.  & it is our duty to submit to the Divine Will- & our best interest too- Let us then hope while hope we may-29th
   
   The letter from Capn. Miller which I read in the papers that reached us last evening, stating that information had been recd. from the Break Water by a Schr. just arrived, that she has passed the Susqa. of Chincoteague, a shr. along side of her- if true, wd. seem to put an end to doubt- But why did not Miller mention the name of the Schr. at the Break Water.  & how did that Schr. know what he saw was the Susqa.  If the ship was in the situation mentioned, & at the time mentioned, it argues a most extraordinary degree of hardy hood in the Pirate.
   
   Yesterday commenced the battle on the Judiciary.  Judge Hopkinson opened the debate- in a masterly manner- he spoke for 3 hours, & then gave way to a motion for adjournment- of course he will proceed with his argument 2d. day morning.  I hear it will prove unavailing- so many of the Convention being resolved on a change.  The discussion will no doubt be protracted thoughout all this week, perhaps even another- so many will try to distinguish themselves on this fruitful subject.  Feeling so much disappointed by the issue of the militia question I can no longer hope for much good from this Convention.  Indeed I care very little now how bad they may make a constitution- the worse perhaps the better-as the people will be the more likely to, reject it.  Earl made his appearance yesterday and forthwith commenced taking notes of Hopkinsons speech- He will attempt a reply- so will I suspect Ingersoll- but the most powerful antagonist will be Woodward- from Luzerne.  He is plausible, argumentative & fluent, but with all a thorough radical & in my judgement a most mischevous politician.  Doran & others are still absent- When I shall be relieved from my unpleasant imprisonment I cannot say.

My own fears are however that Friends have little more to hope for from this Convention.Thos. P. Cope

   Dear Alfred,
   
   It is growing towards being after sunset, but while Job is making arrangements for our departure tomorrow morning in the Massacheusetts Steamer for Providence, it falls to my lot to drop a line by Wm who is intended send with the Carriage & Horses next day, by return of the same Steamer to NYk thence to proceed on his way to Philada.-  You will all be gratified to hear of thy dear mothers improved health, & also of Eleanors- altho we have experienced hot weather for some days, & have qualms as to the propriety of throwing ourselves into a more heated atmosphere-  Stephen P. Morris arrived here yesterday from Providence, & reports the thermometer to have been up to 95 the day before.  The air since dinner to day has become cooler, & we may reasonably hope will improve a pace shortlty-  Other things change as well as the weather- & now after writing so far, a bell man announces that a Balloon Steamer is to be here tomorrow from P. & return again at 3 AM-  We wished originally to go by her- but she has undergone repairs, & there was this morning no certainty when she wd. be here-  We therefore had made up our minds to go by the Massachusetts between 6 & 7 AM-  We intend to visit N. Bedford, Boston, Wooster &c &c.  & stop at Hartford Ct where letters may meet us on our way home, not later than 10 days from today-
   
   We have visited most of the Lions- & among them the Library, where rest the remains of divers elderly volumes-  The discoveries of the Icelanders are there deposited-  We met in the St a certain antiquarian, named Bull, with whom we held learned converse on those discoveries-  On asking him if he had heard of the learned northener who had found a stone with Runic Characters- a temple, & an image representing the Scandanavian God Thor, in Brazil- He said he had not- & then added, "so long as they confined themselves to N. Am, I was willing to concede that point to them- but now that they are going to claim S. Am too, I wont believe any of it"-  The old man may have read our couplet- "They lose the whole who claim too much
    
   As Simon Snyder said in Dutch- And the Danes may now hang up their fiddle, & content themselves with their own Icy shores-The drives abt. Newport are fine- but we have too much dust- the grass is nevertheless very fresh- & the fields are beautiful- We visited a tract at Brenins Point, I side of the Island, & skirted by the Ocean- & a more fertile splendid farm, I do not remember ever to have seen-  They use the seaweed abundantly, as a manure- & also a fish called Manhayden- dragged from the Ocean by nets, & sold at 14 Cts a Bbl- They are very oily- but I do not admire the filthy practice of strewing them over the fields to contaminiate the air-  The bathing here is very good & Job & I use it freely- while mother & E continue their purifications in the warm salt bath-  Among our numerous lodgers we have had Abraham Knickerboker & wife- He the lineal descendant of the true Dietrich- & has his residence at the very spot described by Irving, whose description he says is very correct-  He is an intelligent and well informed man, speaking the English fluently- & his wife interested us very much, by her smiley face, he goodly appearance & good sense-  The good man himself is out of health, & his loving spouse seems very uneasy abt. him-  On leaving us they each gave us a cordial invitation to visit them at their home in the romantic poetical village of Schaghticoke-
     
   While writing Elenor bids me say- you have among you, used her [---] badly, in not even noticing a Letter- wh he took trouble- pains taking man- to endite to some of you- but as she has stepped out- I do not know when manufactured, nor to whom directed- Cara’s epistle of odds & ends- like this of mine- has been received, & was, for her comfort, very satisfactory-
   
   Having in council duly convened decided to go by the Baloon to morrow.  I have come to the conclusion to rest for the present from my labours- to resume if needs be, in the morning but not until I say that we this afternoon paid another visit to the afflicted family mentioned before- none of them are better- the mother indeed much worse- she seems destined we think to take her departure to a better world very soon-

   A bright cool air promising a pleasant [---] to Providence- A boarding House forms a pretty good epitomy of life on a larger scale- One generation passeth away & is succeeded by another- so old faces depart [---] & new ones present themselves- In all things said the great Apostle I am instructed- & so we may be even in this day- did not time hurry us with such Rail Road speed as scarcely to permit us more than a glance- Among our imates is a certain Judge Balch of Florida, a thorough going Loco- & reviler of sacred things- He attempted to show that the creation was the result of natural causes, combining & operating on each other- Moses' account he calls a fiction,the mere offspring of a fervid imagination.  He abounds in anecdote- mostly I suspect the product of his own fancy- His atheism offended Knickerbocker much- it shd. be Knickerbacker- marble baker-  I joked & talked politics with the Judge for a while- but finding when hard pressed he became rude, I quit it- yet shd. be amused with his profundity of discourse could I have faith in his word-  He stated for instance that he had furnished the Bk. US. with the first list of Directors for the branch at Nashville- all of whom "Me. Biddle appointed"- He did not however know that while making this statement to me & others he was addressing a man, who had been not only a Director of the Parent Bank at the time, but chairman of the Cme. of elections, who alone reported all nominations of branch directors, to the Board, & who knew the statement to be untrue-  I did not undeceive him, but left him to the enjoyment of his own fiction.  We had a short visit from a mercht. of Havanna- Cpa!  Clapp of the House of Drake, & Co an intelligent man, who, inter alia, gave me a piece of information entirely new, at least to myself- He says that a company of individuals, Spaniards & others, residents in Cuba have purchased a large tract of sand from a native Prince, in Africa, 150 miles square- wh. is to be cultivated with Coffe Sugar &c for commerce- the natives being the Labourers- should the designs of the Comp.y be honest, & fairly carried out- it will carry out Buxtons Scheme, & prove a great blessing to Africa- but considering of whom the Co. is composed, I cannot avoid fears.  C says the Coffee Plantations in Cuba yield but 6 or 7 Pct. while their Sugar Plantations give them 10- the slaves working 14 hours of the 24- The labour is so severe that when suspended, to take food, he has known the slave to fall asleep while on his feet, & prefer rest, even to eating- the waste of life is consequently great.
   
   The change in the weather has produced its usual effect- my E has a headache but will doubtless be better when the sun advances- by the way we have had but one or two foggy mornings since our arrival-  Job & I mean to experiment on a warm bath this morning deeming the sea air is too fresh for our skins-  Love to all- & sympathy in the bargain for any that have tooth ache or the like-
   Thos. P. Cope
   
   As there are so many at Lincolns who have nothing to do, we have half a mind & almost tother half tooto get our dander up for their wicked neglect open in not writing-
   
   I had just sealed this letter when Henry's of the 22d arrived- & have accordingly reopened it to make the acknowledgment- It is gratifying to learn of your continued good condition & of his having parted with his tooth ache- a most troublesome compassion-  I had not heard of any defaltations in the Kent.y Bank- nothing short of making such crimes felony can prevent them-  We have indeed arrived at a such state of morals-  Finding that the next mail goes via Providnce, I shall carry this letter there- & if anything worth penning occur

Newport 8mo 25. 1840
   
   Dear Alfred,
   
   It is growing towards being after sunset, but while Job is making arrangements for our departure tomorrow morning in the Massacheusetts Steamer for Providence, it falls to my lot to drop a line by Wm who is intended send with the Carriage & Horses next day, by return of the same Steamer to NYk thence to proceed on his way to Philada.-  You will all be gratified to hear of thy dear mothers improved health, & also of Eleanors- altho we have experienced hot weather for some days, & have qualms as to the propriety of throwing ourselves into a more heated atmosphere-  Stephen P. Morris arrived here yesterday from Providence, & reports the thermometer to have been up to 95 the day before.  The air since dinner to day has become cooler, & we may reasonably hope will improve a pace shortlty-  Other things change as well as the weather- & now after writing so far, a bell man announces that a Balloon Steamer is to be here tomorrow from P. & return again at 3 AM-  We wished originally to go by her- but she has undergone repairs, & there was this morning no certainty when she wd. be here-  We therefore had made up our minds to go by the Massachusetts between 6 & 7 AM-  We intend to visit N. Bedford, Boston, Wooster &c &c.  & stop at Hartford Ct where letters may meet us on our way home, not later than 10 days from today-
   
   We have visited most of the Lions- & among them the Library, where rest the remains of divers elderly volumes-  The discoveries of the Icelanders are there deposited-  We met in the St a certain antiquarian, named Bull, with whom we held learned converse on those discoveries-  On asking him if he had heard of the learned northener who had found a stone with Runic Characters- a temple, & an image representing the Scandanavian God Thor, in Brazil- He said he had not- & then added, "so long as they confined themselves to N. Am, I was willing to concede that point to them- but now that they are going to claim S. Am too, I wont believe any of it"-  The old man may have read our couplet- "They lose the whole who claim too much
    
   As Simon Snyder said in Dutch- And the Danes may now hang up their fiddle, & content themselves with their own Icy shores-The drives abt. Newport are fine- but we have too much dust- the grass is nevertheless very fresh- & the fields are beautiful- We visited a tract at Brenins Point, I side of the Island, & skirted by the Ocean- & a more fertile splendid farm, I do not remember ever to have seen-  They use the seaweed abundantly, as a manure- & also a fish called Manhayden- dragged from the Ocean by nets, & sold at 14 Cts a Bbl- They are very oily- but I do not admire the filthy practice of strewing them over the fields to contaminiate the air-  The bathing here is very good & Job & I use it freely- while mother & E continue their purifications in the warm salt bath-  Among our numerous lodgers we have had Abraham Knickerboker & wife- He the lineal descendant of the true Dietrich- & has his residence at the very spot described by Irving, whose description he says is very correct-  He is an intelligent and well informed man, speaking the English fluently- & his wife interested us very much, by her smiley face, he goodly appearance & good sense-  The good man himself is out of health, & his loving spouse seems very uneasy abt. him-  On leaving us they each gave us a cordial invitation to visit them at their home in the romantic poetical village of Schaghticoke-
     
   While writing Elenor bids me say- you have among you, used her [---] badly, in not even noticing a Letter- wh he took trouble- pains taking man- to endite to some of you- but as she has stepped out- I do not know when manufactured, nor to whom directed- Cara’s epistle of odds & ends- like this of mine- has been received, & was, for her comfort, very satisfactory-
   
   Having in council duly convened decided to go by the Baloon to morrow.  I have come to the conclusion to rest for the present from my labours- to resume if needs be, in the morning but not until I say that we this afternoon paid another visit to the afflicted family mentioned before- none of them are better- the mother indeed much worse- she seems destined we think to take her departure to a better world very soon-
   
   26th
   
   A bright cool air promising a pleasant [---] to Providence- A boarding House forms a pretty good epitomy of life on a larger scale- One generation passeth away & is succeeded by another- so old faces depart [---] & new ones present themselves- In all things said the great Apostle I am instructed- & so we may be even in this day- did not time hurry us with such Rail Road speed as scarcely to permit us more than a glance- Among our imates is a certain Judge Balch of Florida, a thorough going Loco- & reviler of sacred things- He attempted to show that the creation was the result of natural causes, combining & operating on each other- Moses' account he calls a fiction,the mere offspring of a fervid imagination.  He abounds in anecdote- mostly I suspect the product of his own fancy- His atheism offended Knickerbocker much- it shd. be Knickerbacker- marble baker-  I joked & talked politics with the Judge for a while- but finding when hard pressed he became rude, I quit it- yet shd. be amused with his profundity of discourse could I have faith in his word-  He stated for instance that he had furnished the Bk. US. with the first list of Directors for the branch at Nashville- all of whom "Me. Biddle appointed"- He did not however know that while making this statement to me & others he was addressing a man, who had been not only a Director of the Parent Bank at the time, but chairman of the Cme. of elections, who alone reported all nominations of branch directors, to the Board, & who knew the statement to be untrue-  I did not undeceive him, but left him to the enjoyment of his own fiction.  We had a short visit from a mercht. of Havanna- Cpa!  Clapp of the House of Drake, & Co an intelligent man, who, inter alia, gave me a piece of information entirely new, at least to myself- He says that a company of individuals, Spaniards & others, residents in Cuba have purchased a large tract of sand from a native Prince, in Africa, 150 miles square- wh. is to be cultivated with Coffe Sugar &c for commerce- the natives being the Labourers- should the designs of the Comp.y be honest, & fairly carried out- it will carry out Buxtons Scheme, & prove a great blessing to Africa- but considering of whom the Co. is composed, I cannot avoid fears.  C says the Coffee Plantations in Cuba yield but 6 or 7 Pct. while their Sugar Plantations give them 10- the slaves working 14 hours of the 24- The labour is so severe that when suspended, to take food, he has known the slave to fall asleep while on his feet, & prefer rest, even to eating- the waste of life is consequently great.
   
   The change in the weather has produced its usual effect- my E has a headache but will doubtless be better when the sun advances- by the way we have had but one or two foggy mornings since our arrival-  Job & I mean to experiment on a warm bath this morning deeming the sea air is too fresh for our skins-  Love to all- & sympathy in the bargain for any that have tooth ache or the like-
   Thos. P. Cope
   
   As there are so many at Lincolns who have nothing to do, we have half a mind & almost tother half tooto get our dander up for their wicked neglect open in not writing-
   
   I had just sealed this letter when Henry's of the 22d arrived- & have accordingly reopened it to make the acknowledgment- It is gratifying to learn of your continued good condition & of his having parted with his tooth ache- a most troublesome compassion-  I had not heard of any defaltations in the Kent.y Bank- nothing short of making such crimes felony can prevent them-  We have indeed arrived at a such state of morals-  Finding that the next mail goes via Providnce, I shall carry this letter there- & if anything worth penning occur
   
   will make proper not thereof-  We rece.d Franks letter of the 22d recording his & Toms marvellous escape from Hicksite contamination- tho I think they might have broken bread with J.B without fatal consequences-

   Dear Clemmie,
   Grandfather desired me to acknowledge the receipt of thy acceptable letter of last seventh day. I am sorry for thy sake that it has not fallen into better hand, but if thee will believe that I have the will to send thee such a letter as would give thee a great deal of pleasure, I will rely upon the interest it will have for thee as coming from among and giving thee a great deal of pleasure. I will rely upon the interest it will have for thee as coming from among and giving thee perhaps, the latest news of some of those who think so much of thee. Anne and I entirely agree with thee in considering that the pleasantest part of the days journey was when we were all traveling together. We ran off the track about half an hour after we parted and were four hours in a pretty hot place before we were on our way again. If we had foreseen that we were to pass nearly the whole day on the road might have he fellow travelers a greater distance and lightened me and others burdens. Thee must have had a very tiresome journey all the way home Henry Drinker tells us thee had to ride from Wilkes-Barre in the hot sun in an open wagon: he thinks they did much better. When thee comes down next winder, take thou Scranton unto. We are glad to hear that thee friend Uncle William so much better and the rest all well. Grandfather seems stronger and generally better than when he fist came out in the country- He sends his love to thee and all the family. Aunt Caroline, Frank and Ellie are at Cape May. I forget whetherthey went before thee left: they wrote several days ago that Ellie’s general health was improved We have heard indirectly that Mary was unwell- Julia has gone to Reading for a few weeks. Aunt Mary returned to Jersey yesterday I believe- She was kept in turn an account of Elizabeth’s mother having an attack very much like if not really cholera. She was very ill one night: they have gone to Cape May since with Henry and Ellie. The three families that live in that unnamed corner of this country that is so hard to find am pretty much as the left them they all send their love. Elizabeth says she would be very glad if thee would write to her if thee fells so inclined. Please tell Uncle William that a package for Grandfather by Henry Drinker came safe to hand the morning- Uncle Alfred has taken the letter out to him. He comes in and spends every "third-day" in town.   
   I hope we shall hear from thee often; if thee should write to me it would give me much pleasure.
   
   Affectionately thy cousin,
   Thomas P Cope Jr.

   Dear Clemmie,
   
   Not having a woman's privilege as to postscripts I begin afresh.  I have no objections however to having reason to call the by name again – it seems more natural and sociable and I see thee look up from thy work or from study or quiet wordto hear what I have to say- I finished in a hurry yesterday afternoon intending to mail this before leaving town, but time failing I have an opportunity to say that Anne secured a letter from Eddy last evening in which he says nothing about his bodily conditions, but that his discontent which she had inquired about are improving" Your visit no doubt did him good. Visits from home to a boy at school are a pleasant recollections for the rest of his life.
   
   Thee did not grieve much about they blanket shawl when thee was riding in the stage at night; it will be cooler when thee comes down next fall and we will take care to sent it up to thee in time. Grandfather will be glad to hear from thee and I hope if thee is not afraid of a repetition of what thy first letter has brought upon thee, that thee will write to [.]
   
   With many desire for thy happiness.
 Affectionately, thy Cousin,

   Thy letter of 28 ult. has been rec'd.  Wm Drinker has transferred his claim on Father to Martin Curtis, store-keeper of Montrose.  ye latter mentioned to me, when I was last in Montrose, that Wm has spoken to him on the subject of stopping any legal proceedings that may have been commenced.  this he said he was willing to do, tho' he wd. not relinquish a cent of ye claim, wh he was sure must be all paid: that unless a legal tender had been made, interest cd. be obtained on ye respective sums for ye time of their becoming due: that he knew W. Drinker had pd. a considerable portion of them in cash, because they had been pd.thro' him.  I told him that I tho't he had only heard one side of the case & advised him not to be to confident of success.-  W.D. also says that he subjected himself to considerable inconvenience in order to pay the taxes, but considered that ye debt was in safe hands & wd. ne accumulating by ye addition of interest.
   
   I observe that the Ches. & Dele. Canal loan has not yet risen, if ye public quotations are to be relied on, & shall be glad if thou hast succeeded in making a further investment for me.-  besides the drafts mentione[d] in thy last, I drew on the 6th inst. draft no. 5 for $50.00.- how [---] does ye agitation in ye corn market affect ye shipping interest?  and what freights have ye packets lately had?-  I was sorry to learn that Alfred was again lame.  please mention in thy next ye cause of his lameness.-  with particular love to ye members of thy family individually, I remain thy affectionate brother,   Wm D Cope

   Dear Brother:
   
   I reached this place after a pleasant journey, which occupied, as usual, 2 days.  I had pleasant company, & never before endured so little fatigue in crossing the Pokono.  the road over it is considerably improved.  I had the company of Jos'h [S?]inton  from Nazareth to Wilkes-barre.  he was on his return from attending the Orthodox Yearly Meeting.-  I was much pleased with the verdant appearance of the fields in this part of ye country.  ye season is much less advanced than usual at this time of year, but the grass looks well.-  there has not been so much done at my buildings during my absense as I expected wd. have been done, but ye workmen are now busily employed.  my Scotch farmer, I think it likely, will maintain the character of his countrymen for industry & fidelity, but I have not hired him long enough, fairly to test his qualifications.  ye female part of his family, however, it too numerous to suit me, as I have but little employment for women.-  tho' I have but little to communicate, I tho't I wd. not let a private opp'y pass without informing you of my safe arrival here & present health.  I shall feel anxious to hear from the invalids of thy family, tho' I hope they are not now invalids.-  I hope also that our new Mother may, by this time have regained her usual health.-  please give my love to all my kind friends & relatives, with whom I have so recently passed so many pleasant hours, that ye chain of communication between us, though separated, seems unbroken & strong.-  if thee shd. see Uncle Jasper please tell him, that I delivered his letter to Henry Colt, but that John N Conyngham had left Montrose before I arrived.  I therefore immediately forwarded the letter for him, to Wilkesbarre, & have little doubt but that he received it before leaving there for Bradford County.   I remain thy affectionate brother,
   Wm D CopePlease say to Eleanor, that I hope she will not mention to Cousins Abby Ann & Emma, any remarks that I made with regard to the evening company invited by them a short time before I left the City & of which I was one.  such observations are sometimes repeated under circumstances that give them an air of more seriousness than was intended by the one who makes them.[Note in second hand: W.D.

   Having an opp'y of writing, I will embrace it if it be only to thank thee for thy kind attention to the subjects mentioned in thine of 22 ult.-  ye mildness of ye season so far, will probably favor the operations of the Ches. & Del. Canal Co.-  I hope the Algonquin may do well at Savannah, as I observe by late a/cts, that no vessels were up there, & freights were brisk, tho' ye rates were low.  if it be not improper, nor too much trouble, please mention in writing to me, ye names of ye authors of any of the essays in "the Friend," that may come to thy knowledge.-  we have lately had a visit in these parts, from two hetorodox friends, Jno. Foulke of Quakertown, Bucks Co., & Salathiel Cleaver, of Montgomery Co.-  they had meetings at Friendsville, & in the neighborhood.  the Presbyterians expressedtheir satisfaction with the communications of J. Foulke.  I did not hear him speak in public, but understand that he did not speak on doctrinal points.  he is a man of venerable appearance, & his plain, communicative, unostentatious habits & manners, are calculated to preposess a stranger in his favour.  amongst other places, that he has visited, is ye settlement of the German Separatists in the Western country.  he speaks of their condition as very comfortable & flourishing.  the canal which is to connect the Lakes with the Ohio, passes thro' their land.
   
   I have just rec'd a letter from Caroline.  please give my love to her & tell her, that I will thank her to use my authority in contradicting any rumours of the kind to which she alludes.-  we are obliged to submit to the mortification of being ye subjects of them, but I think it is no more improper to contradict such, than any other incorrect reports.

   Dear Brother,
   
   Thine of 24 ult. reached me by last mail as there is no magistrate in my immediate neighborhood, I annex a short power of atty, confirmed by private witness if this should not be sufficient to enable thee to collect the divd. on the M.S. B'k stock. I will be obliged by thy procuring a certified copy of the power in thy hands, as the expense of one cannot I think, be so much but that ye include any amount of ye divd. would soon more than repay it, and may as well have ye use of ye money as the Bank. Please when convenient, invest this and ye sum for Ches. and Del. Canal Co., and the Ches. Del. Canal loan at the current price of said loan, unless it should so happen that you could use it to advantage. I am pleased to hear that you are likely to [acrue] something on your claim against ye estate of Geo. [Yeuillo] as this is not generally a good season for freights, I am willing to hope that other causes besides ye influence of the tariff may be assigned for ye poor freight of the Algonquin. I am sorry that several of our worthy friends are likely to suffer by M. Evans' failure, and I hope they may not be seriously embarrassed. At ye close of thy letter, allusion is made to a subject, on which I feel as if I would at present, as willing be silent, as to open my mouth. I nevertheless, feel grateful for ye interest, expressed by thee. It remains exactly, as far as my knowledge extends, in ye estate in which it was when I last conversed with thee in regard to it. Nothing has passed between ye parties since ye reasons for this, as will as ye subject itself, it does not appear to me to be desirable to portray on paper. A disposition to regret the course that I adopted sometimes arises, but a consciousness of rectitude of intention, check its growth. Though I may fail in practicing upon it, I think ye theory, good, that after having acted our part agreeably to ye best of our judgment and conscience, we should in regard to temporal things, discard anxiety about future events. We unsocialably encounter ills enough without creating such as not ye avoided. I intended answering Caroline's & Alfred's letterswithout much delay. I desire love to the members of thy household and remain thy affectionate brother,
   William D. Cope

   Dear Brother:
   
   Thine of 29th ult. has been rece'd. I was pleased to learn that our parents were well, and hope that Edward & Alfred may be benefited by their proposed excursion and that thou may’st also find time to enjoy ye benefits of ye same kind of recreation. Ye country is now enlivened by visitors from ye City and Susquehanna Co. is favoured with a share of them. James Holly Biddle bro't back with them from Phila. their sisters Sarah Biddle and Mary Drinker, and E. Walker's family have ye company of ye widow Morris, and her daughters, Susan & Elizabeth. We have lately been favoured also with a visit from Joel Woolman and Alvin Keyser, appointed by Abington Quarterly Meeting to visit Friendsville Preparative Meeting. they appeared to be man of plain, unassuming humble manners, and were well received by both Hicksites & Orthodox. Cha's Shoemaker accompanied them as far as a Stroudsburg, where he became so ill, as to present his proceeding further. We have subsequently had a visit from Ja's Bell, another orthodox friend and an elder, appointed by Stroudsburg Monthly Meeting.
    
    Dan'l Stroud has been indisposed, or he also wd. probably have visited this part of his flock.  he occasionally writes excellent letters of advice to afford thee an idea of his decisive and at the same time affectionate letters of language & manner, I will give thee an extract from one of them, recently addressed to E. Walker: "distressing as is ye fact, yet it certainly is the case, that the Hicksites are a distinct Society from Friends, and ye separation proceeded from ye leaders of that seccession having become corrupted with anti-christian doctrines, mostly Socinian, but compounded with some other speculative notions, made up into bills to suit ye subjects to whom they were to be administered, and gilt with specious professions of great spirituality, to captivate members and professors with Friends. this with various practices, such as are too commonly used in electioneering, have beguiled & seduced many, who have not or had not previously embraced those awfully dreadful notions, not fitting to be styled doctrines, when we are speaking of religion, and whether these will become leavened into the mass of infidelity with their leaders, or separate from them remains among the things which futurity must disclose. that thou & I, and ye dear children Providentially entrusted to our care, may be preserved from this direful contagion, I have earnestly craved, feeling some hope, that we may resist every temptation that may beset us, to unsettle us and loss about with every wind of doctrine.
    
   If we ever knew anything, "as we ought to know", le us "walk by ye same rule and mind the same thing." Let us be satisfied with and established in "the faith once delivered to ye saints",and say with ye apostle, "thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift", in uniting Deity & virility so as to provide salvation for our fallen race, consistently with divine justine & mercy, though the august plan & means were such as Angels desired to look into.  and tho' this wonderful union is beyond their conception & ours also, we shd. be grateful for it, for surely it is exactly adapted to the condition & need of us poor frail beings, inasmuch as it is complete, or affords complete salvation, both indemnity & cure. Redemption from the penalty & power of sin; remdemption from the penalty by the atonement made by Jesus Christ, our Lord, being God & man;- and redemption from ye power or government of sin by the Holy Spirit, so received into & operating upon our hearts, as to change them, producing a birth of ye spirit & furnishing divine ability in faithful humility & obedience, to resist temptation & be preserved in divine acceptance."++++- Present my very warm & cordial love to thy very dear children, who I feel expressibly near to me. I remember ye kindness of R. T. also; and entertain sentiments of regard for our dear yound friend W. D. Cope, your near neighbour. under sensations which I am thankful for, I bid you all affectionately fare well." (signed) Daniel Stroud.-
   
   Thy observations with regard to ye precarious tenure of our hold on life, are worthy of being often recalled, & deeply impressed upon ye memory & ye heart.- with thyself, I hope & trust that ye deep concern & unbounded affection of our dear deceased Mother for us, will not have been uttered & felt in vain;- that ye expression of her hopes & fears, her sighs & sorrows, have not been for naught.-  I sincerely desire that ye change in ye management of your business, may be advantageous in a pecuniary point of view to thyself & Alfred, but ye annunciation of it, caused a shade of sorrow to pass over my heart. ye expunging of a name, upon which we have been in ye habit of looking so long, that we look upon it with a degree of veneration, seems somewhat like ye disappearance of an old friend or favourite.
   
   I have had workmen pretty constantly employed at my building since my last return from ye City, sometimes to ye number of 6 or 8, sometimes more. ye attention which these, my farm & Father's estate, occupies my time, pretty fully. ye last mentioned concern requires in its present stage & condition much attention for but little profit. but it is absolutely necessary that something shd. be done to guard against ye effects to which it is liable from an accumulation of taxes & interest. I still look forward however, to a change, decidedly for ye better, but we are so apt to be too fast in our calculations, that it becomes us to be cautious.-  I think it likely from present appearances, that my investment in ye stock of ye Leigh Coal and Navigation Co, will be a good one. I am not displeased to find myself becoming more & more interested in my farm. I form an attachment for every tree & every field, which has called forth my care & attention,- for every hill and every valley, that have afforded me gratification by their smiles & beauties.  ye lover of ye country can often realize ye enthusiasm of [Hervey], & exclaim, "when the little hills rejoice & the vallies laugh & sing, who can forbear joining ye general joy". I have at all events reason for self gratulation, inasmuch as I am more pleased with my present mode of life, than I at one time ever expected to be.- I early perceived that with my limited means, I mustbe contented with advancing slowly, in any improvements that I might wish to make, but it has been very difficult to reconcile myself to making so little progress as yet been able to make, owing to ye circumstance last mentioned as well as others.-  I expect that ye capital & influence that Caleb Carmalt is employing in favour of this County, will be of advantage to it, though we we may not feel their effects immediately in this neighbourhood.  some of E. Walker's Family, who have recently been at Friendsville, mention, that he has 30 men & 9 yoke of oxen at work on his farm.  two of his brothers, & one of his sisters have also pitched their tents at Friendsville.-  his brother James, fm Philada., has purchased a farm of 1000 acres & is employed in improving it.-
   
   With particular love to all, I remain thy affectionate brother,
    Wm D Cope
   
   Since writing ye foregoing, I have received thine of 6 ins’t. I will attend to doing what is necessary, to further ye collection of ye divd on ye Canal loan. I hardly expect that there will be any divd. this year, on ye Lehigh Canal stock, but if there should be, I will be obliged by thy informing me of it.-  in addition to the drafts referred to by thee, I passed one to C. Avery & Co, on ye 10 ins't, numbd. 10, for $50.00.-  I regret that I can get no tidings of my missing papers.-  I am obliged by ye information communicated by thee respecting the C & D Canal.  that great work, seems still to baffle calculation.Woodbourne

    September 13th-1813
   
   Esteemed Friend William D Cope,
   
   I have received thy letter of the 30the of August which informes me that thee has accomplished thy journey Westward and is now at thy own home in Philadelphia. Therefore I now purpose writing thee a few lines by way of answer both to the above mentioned letter and that of the 25th of July. Friend Cope I judge thee thinks I am a very lazy fellow for nether meeting thee at West-Chester nor answering thy letter before this-time. but, as for the former I think I have a very good reason for I did not receive the intelligence of thee being there till about 5 days after the appointed time which was the only reason why I was not there for I would have been well pleased to of had the opurtunity of seeing my Friend by going the small distance of ten miles.but, altho thy friend was disappointed of the operturnity he thanks thee kindly for the invitation. The account thee has given me of Lancaster town is very similar to what I expected it was, but as for Columbia I did not expect its adjacent lands were so hilly, or, had such Mountains in them as thee mentions.I understand Friend E Lewis lately buried his son Ennoch with the flux. but I did not understan that the disorder has spread in the family.    
   With a hope that these lines may find thee in as good a state of health as I am in I conclude, and subscribe myself thy affectionate friend.

   4th day eve
   
   Dear Sisters,
   
    I presume you started as you expected at 7 o'clock this morning and if I may judge by the coolness of the atmosphere here at that hour,  I should think that you needed your blanket shawls on the river, and now perhaps you have them on again pacing the deck of the steamer on the Sound.
   
   But I write now more particularly at Father's request. He wished me to record the uncommon softness and mellow tints of the sky. For the Sun after a cloudy day is setting perfectly clear & the evening is certainly one of the pleasantest we have had this season. Though probably more so to him, having just returned from his business in the city. We miss your company very much, but I have no doubt but that you will enjoy yourselves exceedingly and return refreshed as you expect in body and mind.
    
   I wil now close for this evening and making a short addition tomorrow I will leave the remainder of the sheet to Mary.5th day 24st
   
   Wistar informed Mother last evening that Mamaduke Cope went to New York yesterday in the early line. You must have seen him. He goes to see the English Minister Pease previous to his tour to Canada.
   
   I expect that you have by this time nearly or quite recovered from the fatigue attending your journey. Sue would perhaps feel it the most as she is so unaccustomed to travelling. We intend to send Harry to the city tomorrow and our family will then be very small.
    
   You must write soon as father and all of us would wish to hear. Perhaps you will trouble yourselves to note down some of the most interesting things you see and then you will retain them more fresh in you memory for our benefit, as will as your own. Please remember me to Cousin William. We are all quite well & hoping that you are the same & wishing you every enjoyment
    I bid you adieu-
   
   Your aff Bro William.Dear Sisters,
   
   William & I concluded it would be a good place to set you all example by penning a few lines immediately; accordingly I have seated myself in our old apartment at 12 past 9 o'clock, whilst the rest of the family are quietly giving themselves up to repose, for since your departure we have retired ever earlier if possible than usual, in order to give you an idea how matters work on School house lane. We feel quite impatient to hear how Sue bore the journey. I hope you experienced no detention in consequence of the [---]; we saw by the paper this eve that the passenger cars from New York were notable to come on [---] day as so large an amount of rain had fallen as completely to deluge the road. Our meeting at Arch st was so as very large this morning as it was expected the English friends would be there but owing to the lat[---] storm they could not arrive till this evening I supposed they are now in the city. Francis B was at Uncle Moses' this afternoon perhaps if Anna had been at home he would have done her the favour to have called but as he has now received information that she is not at home he will take precious care that he does not show his face in these parts for several weeks; he had a letter a few days since from Cape May.  the family are all very well and intend coming home in a few days. Frank says if they do not return by second day, which is the last day the boat runs, they will have either to swim or return by land so that it is most probable they will arrive by the the end of this week. Wistar spent this evening with us very pleasantly he says every thing is going on in the city as usual very few persons have as yet returned. Mother wishes that you should buy her a [--] de [---] dress in Boston. If you see any thing that would be suitable; she wishes you to consult your own taste in the matter. If you see one with a small figure that you admire get it or if you see a handsome plain one, not too light a color, something that would be suitable for autumn.  A plain one she would rather prefer if youmet with what suited you. Give my love to Cousins R & Maria and tell the former I regretted exedingly not having an opportunity to bid adieu farewell Mother and I fully expected to have seen him in the city and were quite disappointed in not doing so. I hope you will write soon and let us know how you are coming on as it is the only thing you can do to cheer us during your absence as the evening draws to a close I believe I must now bid you an aff good night. excuse haste.  if you either of choose to favour me with an epistle I will promise to answer it immediately and to some length.  your aff sister Mary.I suppose the Cousins R. & Maria to whom Aunt Mary refers in this letter where Cousins Robert & Maria Earle.

   Dear Sisters,
   
    I presume you started as you expected at 7 o'clock this morning and if I may judge by the coolness of the atmosphere here at that hour,  I should think that you needed your blanket shawls on the river, and now perhaps you have them on again pacing the deck of the steamer on the Sound.
   
   But I write now more particularly at Father's request. He wished me to record the uncommon softness and mellow tints of the sky. For the Sun after a cloudy day is setting perfectly clear & the evening is certainly one of the pleasantest we have had this season.

   My dear Annette,
   
   When I reached Holmhurst last week Nanna immediately presented me with thy package, and I opened and found the irresistable little gentleman from Dai Nippon. Where did thee pick him up, I wonder! He will be a most pleasant memento of thee, though I shall hesitate to insult his diginity by inkinghis fine skirts! I have thought of thee, and of you all so much this summer, and greatly wished I could have seen thee and Carrie before we leave. I hoped Mrs. Cope would return while I was at Holmhurst, but she is I supppose still with you. If so please give her my dear love. Thee will forgive me I know for this tardy work, I spent a whole week nominally at Holmhurst, actually between the city, Germantown, and all the [---]. Thee knows onlytoo well what such packing is. Now I am enjoying a few day's rest at Woodbourne before going back to Awbury for a square start westward. Virginia here and sends her love, also says to tell thee that I will meet thee in Italy winter after next. I tell her I give the message as hers, not mine! Much as I should like such a prospect; she is much more liekly to turn up there in the next year or two, than I! Lillie and the girls & Thos. & Elizabeth Cope are entertaining Dr. Norris and a Germandoctor friend in the parlor, else they would doubtless send messages. Please give my love to Carrie and Clementine, I understand you are all together, and are glad to know you have that comfort. With dear love for thy own self, and thanks for thinking of me amid so much sorrow, I am as always,
   
   Affectionally thine

   Sept 4th 1904
   
   Dearest Mother, 
   
   Sunday and a large dinner having brought a temporary lull in the activities of our household I am going to get in a letter to thee before thee leaves Franconia. 
   
   With a jolly crowd, good weather and plenty to do we are enjoying ourselves very much and if only thee and Anna were here with us we could ask for little to make things complete. But since that may bot be we are rejoicing that we shallor at least some of us, see you before long at Batemans. 
   
   Since a week ago yesterday we have kept moving at quite a rapid gait, leaving for the most part out of doors and hence cultivating large healthy appetites. Plates are busy, I can tell thee, passing up and down the "festive board", and as for the butter words fail. Of course our for us of entertainment are not so tremendously varied but they are good ones and hence we do not grow tired of repeating. We generally start out the day by playing some good active to properly shake our breakfast down and to put ourselves proper frame of mind for a swim and  when this is attained we descend like "wolves on the fold" of those good friends of ours, the Whitalls, who in spite of our filling up their boat house and bath house still seem to preserve their equanimity of temper. For which let us be truly thankful, for really I don't know how we could get along without our good swim off their pier. 
   
    Sailing is our principal other pastime and we have had several good times in the faithful "Three Sisters". However, as we only hire the boat four days out of seven there are times when we must occupy ourselces in other ways. One of those days last we went on a picnic to Beaver Tail and had a splendid time the large express wagon up the Newport Transfer Co. sevred as our charist and pulled by four large horses kept in a gallop most of the way by our energetic driver we must I'm sure have made an imposing spectacle. The little cove where we usually go took on quite a homelike cozy air as it's walls reflected back the glow of our blazing bonfire round  which we sat while some of the musical members entertained us. I think I enjoy our Beaver Tail picnics more than any others. Still whereI think of one we had only yesterday over on the mainland near where the boys once camped in narrow River I am tempted to qualify that statement. 
   
   The Family Emlen are qutie prevalent here this Sunday Sam and Art have come up over labor Day, Sam staying here and Art at the Kimbers while Cousins Ellie and George are just across the way from us. It is very nie to have so many friends here. 
   
   I am sorry that my long delay in writing has this time not even an excuse of verse but a mother's forbearance is so easily imposed on, that I hope thee will forgive me once more I am very glad thee liked the poem. By the way, I never told thee that I would be very glad to hear what Miss Simpson has to say about my studying law. 
   
   With a great deal of love to ann and thyself. 
   
   Thy affectionate son

   Dearest Mother, 
   
   My postal from New York will have informed you that the first part of my journey was safely accomplished and you will be glad to know that the ending was also successful. After fooling around in the Natural History Museum till about eleven o'clock I went down town  again via the subway and boarded the Black Diamond in Jersey City. It was a fine day and very pretty coming up. The trip on the little train from Tunkhannock to Woodbourne was especially pretty. Many of the fields were a mass of white and yellow with daisies and buttercups and the soft late afternoon sunlight still brightness the hillsides. I arrived at Woodbourne just about ontime, that is, 7 o'clock and Frank and Er drove down to meet me. They are all well and happy apparently, disquieted only by the fact that Theadora has a habit of yelling like a trooper where put to bed. Tell Father and Miss Richardson that I placed two kisses, one on each check for the respective ones which they sent. She didn't burst into tears as you mighthave expected but only weathered me with a stony stare. 
   
   Last night was beautifully dear and today is bright. I hope the fog has been blown away from Conanicut. Aunt Lilly seeds her love and says to thank thee very much for thy letter; she will write soon. Please give my love to Father and Anna and tell the former that the mileage book was not good on the Lehigh Valley. 
   
   Affectionately thy son

   Dear Mother, 
   
   Here we are safe and sound on board the old craft and out of sight of land already at 7.30 a.m.  I am writing this to go by the pilot as he has not left us yet. The main reason for our being out of sight of land is that the fog is ratherthick.  I didn't turn out very early and am just as glad that I didn't as there wasn't much to be seen I guess, coming down the harbor. Ed didn't either, though he had thought of it last night.  Our roommates are named Argill and O'Brien. The latter appears to be a self-made Irishman, but rather good company I guess. Argill I have not seen yet in his civilized clothes. He is not what youwould call a sleeping beauty. George says he has a very nice man in his room.    A Mr Tucker. 
   
   Class Day and commencement went off very well and we had very good weather a very seemtial point. Uncle Will made nice address. 
   
    Please thank Anna very much for her steamer letter. It was very good of her to write. Please give my love and Aunty Lily and Ellie. Ed sends love to them and to both Ann & thyself in which I join. 
   
    Lovingly thy son,

Title: 1905 August 16, Hotel de Rome & Suisse, Venise, to Grandpa

Dear Grandpa,
   
   As mother in her last letter makes some mention of forwarding letters to you at North East I am going to try to give thee a little direct news instead of such second hand stuff. We are; as this large poster at the top of the page is intended to indicate, I suppose, staying at this Hotel de Rome in Venice. Hotel de New York would be a more apporopriate title as the house is full of Americans. 
   
   Venice is certainly a most picturesque and interesting place and would be a most attractive place for a long stay if it were not for the Italians and the smells. However in this last respect it is nothing to Desenzano, which  has certainly pleanty of "loacl atmosphere" about it. We arrived in Venice on Fifth day (8/24) and since then have been trying to see something of the sights of the old city. It was certainly a most complete change to embark on a gondola and be rowed, paddled, or whatever they call it, to our hotel. It seemed as though we were living in a picture. Fortunality our hotel  is on the grand Canal and only about five minutes walk from the square of St. Marks. We have spent quite a good deal of our time about the last and have enjoyed the fine old church much. The more one seens of it the more you begin to appreciate it. The mosaics are wonderful and the whole effect of the interior of the church (though somewhat interfered with by scaffolding, just now) is one of great richness of color. I think though that at least as far as architecture is concerned I prefer some of the fine onld English ministers. the Doges Place is also very fine in many ways but not nearly so attractive as St. Mark. The ceiling decorations are too heavyand intricate for my taste. We spent about two hours of one afternoon in a gondola on the Grand Canal, a most lazy but throughly enjoyable way of spending our time. Thee old canals are, I think, decidely the most attractive part of the place, and the gondola seems to fit them admirably. We want from one side to the other of the Grand Canal and were finally landed on our own doorstep. A most easy and satisfactory performance. 
   
   An emormous Italian (or French (?)) gentleman who is staying at our hotel is probably not so enthusiastic on this last subject as he managed to fall overboard during the performance to-day. Edward and I were aroused from the writing room by a great screaming of women and ran out on the porch expecting that something serious had happened, only to fin this great lump sitting on the steps, wet up to waist, and looking like some old sealion. He was so mad that he raged about in true Italian style and for some time refused to pay his gondoleer, or "poppe" I believe they call the man who runs the craft.  It was really very amusing. 
   
   This morning we went to the picture Gallery here.  The colors of some of the old masterpieces are very fine but I am afraid that I am not educated up to an appreciation of them.  The faces are so impassive that it quite destroys the sentiment and feeling in the work.  Uncle Tom I suppose will laugh at this, but I can't help it.  They are impassive.  Titian's "Assumption of the Madonna" was thr finest work we saw there I think.  The coloring and grouping in it are fine. 
   
   To-morrow we leave for Milan and thence on Second day we expect to go up into Switzerland again by way of Lago Maggiore.  It will be quite a relief in some ways, for I don't care for the Italian people or their smells.  Please give Uncles Tom & Will and Aunt Carrie my love.  Also please give a great deal of love to Grandma.  Ed sends his love to thee and Grandma.  With much love from thy affectionate Grandson Ernest.

   I was very glad to get thy letter - and am sorry I have not written more frequently of late.  I am also sorry that thee missed thy sleep even though it was for the benefit of thy son.  I hope thee don't wake up at such times usually. 
   
   We returned from [---] on Sixth day afternoon.  There were two crowds at the Lodge at different times- and so Margaret asked me to stay over I had a fine long visit from Monday morning until Friday noon.  Katharine, Mildred, & Marianna Buffum and Mary Reamy (a school friend of Margaret's) went over on the 6.15 trip of the Conanicut with Harold and me, and arrived at the Lodge, via. Mickford, at about two o'clock Margaret and George drove down and Mr Buffum and Billy rode on horse back.  We welcomed them to the Lodge about twelve, Mrs BuffumCope and George, the coachman, arrived about four.  Thus the first crowd migrated in small flocks.  Miss Blodgett came on Third day afternoon.  She is an East Greenwich girl and seems very nice and jolly though I dont know her very well -as I had never set eyes on her before she came to camp.  She stayed until Friday, but Katharine Mildred & Miss Reamy came up on Fourth day afternoon with Harold & George, so I was left a stranger among strangers.  The others who came late Tuesday night & on Wednesday morning were Mary Sands & Frida Paine (both Newporters) [---] Spencer and Geo. Phillips, the last being a Boston fellow.  Now I believe I have catalogued the crowd.  Thee knows that the Lodge is right on the Qiocompang Pond, a lake a little over a mile long and a little over half a mile wide.  The shores are quite irregular and are wooded right down to the very brink, the underbrush overhanging the water in many places, so the lake, though small is very pretty.  If you paddle to the far end of the lake from the Lodgeand then push up into a little reedy cove and make a carry of about 30 or 40 yards, you find yourself in [---] Pond- a small pond quite different in character from Qiocompang- as the shores are steep and there is a narrow stoney beach all around.  If you paddle to the far end of [---] Pond and then land and climb the hill through woods you can look out across the country and see the ocean beyond.  Which is a pretty nice thing to do.  I went down twice once with Katharine and again with Miss Blodgett.We had some good walks too.  The woods are pretty around that section and the whole country is surprisingly wild and unspoiled.  There are deer and grouse in fairly good numbers and they say that there are trout in the streams and bass and pickerel & pirch in the lake.  There are a good many nice wood trails to walk along and it is great sport exploring and seeing where you bring up.  You have to be careful though as you can lose yourself without much difficulty.  We had a great walk on Fourth day morning in a pouring rain.  Most ofthe way over (we went to Natchang Pond a lake about five miles from the Lodge by the way we went over) was through the woods for most of the way and through little trails.  I was piloting the party over and as I had only taken the walk once and that was two years ago I was a little nervous but by good luck turned out O.K.  Harold had been over this way with us the time before and Mr Buffum knew the general lay of the land pretty well so it wasn't so bad as it sounds.  It rained like everything and we simply drenched but had great sport.  Some of the girls went in bathing suits. 
   
   So much for [---].  I'll try to get down & things nearer home.  If it suits you I am thinking of coming up to see you for a few days.  As I have just been away and as there are great attractions here in the shape of a prospective canoeing party on the Ten Mile River and Henry Scattergood and possibly Frank Stokes on Seventh and First day, I think that I wont come up until to-morrow week Aug 22nd and stay until Sixth day the 26th.  If this don't suit you I hope you will let me know.  I feel as if I had been off on a great many side trips since this summer and don't feel as if I ought to be the one to go again.  It seems as though the other boys ought to have a turn.  But it looks now as though I were going to be this forward one again.  So I am looking forward to seeing you on the 22nd if all goes well.  It will be fine. 
   
   Esther arrived yesterday and Elizabeth Roberts is staying with us too and as Stodgell Stokes took dinner with us we are quite gay.  Yesterday afternoon Katharine and I walked down to Beaver tail.  It was very nice down there as usual tho. there was no surf.  We sat on the rocks for a while and got back just about seven.  The rest of them took a drive except Harold who played tennis with Margaret Buffum at the club.  Esther Emlen is staying at the Emlens.  She wanted me to send her love to thee and A. Please give the latter much love and keep much for thyself. 
   As ever thy affectionate son
   
   Ernest P.S. I think I will come up on the train leaving Boston at 10.00 & arriving at Littleton at 4.30 If Littleton is not the sta. please let me know.  Esther & Ed send love.

   My dear little Anna
    
   I have thought of thee very often since thee left us on 4th day morning and shall be glad to hear how thee and Ethel made out on your journey, did she behave well? and was thee very tired when thee got to Montrose? I expect you have had a great many nice plays together, I mean thee, Agnes, Franky and Ellie, not Ethel and thee! I left Germantown the day after thee did and came down  to Maryland with cousins George Emlen and Katy Stokes, Edith came over to Conowingo to meet us, with Robert, and they put the trunk in the front of the carriage and sat on it instead of a seat, cousin George rode up with Horace Stokes, so we all got home nicely, only the roads are very rough and we were well shaken up. Just after dinner today we had a very hard rain and Wistar, Edith and Franky put on thin bathing clothes and ran about out doors until it was nearly over and then they went down to the streamthat crosses our lane and here they found the water so deep they took another bath in that, which they thought was great fun. They have a kitten a little larger than yours but she is nearly all white except her tail which is grey with a white tip; aunt Kate says her name is Pennyroyal but Edith don't like that at all, and Wistar says she ought to be called Tip. We expect Henry home tomorrow and shall be very glad to see him. Cousin George, Ellie and the children are not staying with us now, theyare at Gideon Smiths but the children, all except Sam, are to go home tomorrow. I hope Franky's trumpet did not get bent going up, and that he liked it and the game. I am afraid Aunt Lilly won't care to have him blow the trumpet very near the house, perhaps you take it when you go out rowing on the lake or walking in the woods. I hope thee will get quite strong and fat and have a very good time. Give my love to aunt Lilly and Anna and a great deal to thy self with a kiss from thy aunt Hannah.The Children have all gone to bed or they would send love to thee.Anna Cope Evans

   My dear sister
   
   I am once more at home and quite miss hearing of thy welfare and dear Anna's from Jonathan's letters.  I hope you still continue to gain and enjoy the mountain air.  When I got home last 2nd day, I felt very much used up with the heat & the change in air, but now have become accustomed to it and feel quite well, tho' the amount of moisture in the air makes things damp & sticky.  No doubt thee has heard particulars of E.W. Copes last hours, the close must have been very peaceful, both Ellie & Madgie express their feelings of thankfulness that their mother did not have to endure long confinement and great suffering.  The funeral was small, so many are away, S. Morris and E Allen bore testimony to her character, there was nothing said at the grave but there was such a sweet, quiet feeling as we stood silently there in the evening lights, everything looking so beautiful & peaceful, words did not seem to be needed.  E. Allen said after meeting today to Eleanor & me, that after sheheard of E.W. Copes death she went into her room and such a sweet feeling came over her, she felt it was a forecast of the rest & peace into which Elizabeth Cope had entered.  I rode to the ground with cousin Rebecca Evans, she spoke of cousin Elizabeth, said the letter thee wrote her had been such a particular comfort and help to her, that Rebecca had felt she must write & tell thee but has been rather burdened with calls, so I said I would let thee know about it, I think R sent her love to thee.  Will & Grace have both had mumps, and little Mary, (Alice'sdaughter) has been very sick, she is now gaining down at the Dennis and Grace has been there with them.  Cousin Wm & John Rhoads have gone to T. Brown's camp for their vacation.  I send thee one of Esthers letters as thee may be interested to hear something of the Conference.  It seems to have been a time of spiritual refreshment & uplifting & I hope may prove of use to the building up of the Church.  Eleanor says the spirit of love & unity was very marked, Alfred urged that all [---] and feelings of antagonism between old & young, conservative & progressive should be laidaside, which seemed to be the case.  Alfred seems to feel his mind relieved of the concern, he went back to Bupshire yesterday & is going on to Northfield.  Frank Goodhue also went to Bupshire will spend today there & go on to Brattleboro taking little Mary with him.  Edith Silver came up on 5th day eve, it was very pleasant to see her, she went home yesterday, Betty & little Elizabeth & Sam Mason all went with her.  Betty intends spending a couple of weeks at Swallowfield where she hopes to have a good rest.  Francis Jr is at Bupshire so all the children are cared for.  Sister Eleanor & Tom I believe are going to Bupshire soon & Wistar to the South on business so the house will be deserted  for awhile.  Katy & the childrenpropose coming home on 3rd day.  Frank came on to the funeral but went back last night, I am glad for him to have a visit there.  Emma Edwards fell in her house and broke her hip, she is now very ill not expected to live & her life is not to be [---] under the circumstances.  I had an active time last week attending meetings but got on better than I expected to, tomorrow is Phila Quarterly Mg & 5th day ours, after that I shall take a rest and do a little here at home, as I see many things that need looking after.  I dont know when Esther will come home probably in about a week.  A great deal of love to dear Anna & also for thyself from thy attached sister

Title: 1905 September 5, Jamestown R.I., to Mother

Jamestown R.I.
   Sept 5th 1905
   
   Dear Mother
   
   I was just about to write to thee, in fact I started a letter last night, getting as far as the date,- when I received thine this morning.  I wrote to Mr. Wood on Sixth day and I suppose he has received it by this time.  It is rather a new experience writing to elderly gentlemen, so I hope I didn't say anything queer. 
   
   Art Brown arrived a week ago last First-day and he and Paul and I had a very good time.  Art is very different from the rest of mankind- he is so very anxious to please and writes letters at such an awful rate.  In one mail he sent eight or nine letters including postals.  Isn't that awful? We jollied him a great deal, Paul and I, too much I am afraid, but he was so good-natured about it that it was hard to know when to stop.  On Third-day, after we had been to tennis, Margaret Mellor asked us all to go out sailing.  I could not go as I had to play in the tennis tournament, but Paul and Art went and had a rather amusing time.  Then she asked us down to a marshmallow roast on Fifth-day night.  We were not very keen about going but nevertheless went and had a very crazy time.  In the first place the crowd did not know each other at all,- some of them were very gay and sporty while others were sedate and sober like myself.  Paul and Art spent most of the time having a marshmallow fight.  Eleanor Haydock was there (this was the one saving feature of the evening) and so I managed to survive.  The consequence of these two invitations wasthat we decided we ought to try to do some thing in return.  Sixth-day was Arts last day so we tried to find out what he wanted to do and finally decided to take a sail in the morning and the Ocean Drive in the afternoon.  Paul decided he would rather play tennis so Art and I went down to the Bay Voyage and asked Margaret Mellor and Eleanor Haydock to go.  I am not especially keen about Margaret Mellorm so she, of course, went, while Eleanor, who was staying at [---] Wharton's, decided she had better return and see whether they had anything for her to do.  We took three large fat magazines and managed to have a pretty good time.  In the afternoon we took the Ocean Drive and nearly died laughing.  The swells were out in force with their footmen and coachmen, and, as
Paul and Art were not much used to them, some of their remarks were very amusing.  They kept speaking to the different ones they passed and then went off in fits of laughter.  We drove back over the hills back of the golf-course, and it certainly was mighty pretty.  Art left that night and went down to Elsie Smith's house-party the next day.  Paul left on Seventh day morning on the nine o'clock train for Boston and went up to the White Mts (as far as Plymouth by the same train as we took).  He is at present at the Flume House, and I should not be so very much surprised if he came over your way some of these days.  His father and mother, Ellis and he are going to stay there for a couple of weeks and Paul told me that his father had been going up there for the last fifty years and had only missed about
ten.  I don't know whether this is true or not but Paul said so!  Alg and the rest of the crowd arrived about an hour after Paul departed this island (You say "departed this life" so I don't see why you should not say "departed this island").  Things began to move [instanter?] and the first thing done was a game of roof-ball in which Art and I defeated Joe and Alg most ignominiously after which we inquired if they could play marbles or any such game!  A little baby-in-the-hat was the result but unfortunately was interrupted by swimming.  On Seventh-day afternoon Jim asked me to race with him in his new half-rater (15 footer).  I accepted with great pleasure and went down to Whitall's to lunch.  Six of the little boats, all exactly alike, started.  There were two of E.D. Morgan's (one sailed by his daughter and the other byhis son) one of the Lippitt's, on of the Wetherill's and one sailed by Miss Grosvenor.  Miss Morgan did not understand the course and started off wrong, but instead of giving up the race she kept her nerve and came chasing after us.  When we rounded the last buoy we were third but were soon passed by another boat.  From that time on Miss Morgan and we did not follow the rest but showed our independence, and we won while she came in second.  I was pretty nearly as glad to see her beat the rest of them as I was that we won.  It was Jim's first victory so I think I must have been his mascot!  When we awoke on First-day morning a good old southeaster was snoring outside but we braved the elements and went to meeting.  Comong home it rained so hard that it went right through my rain coat,and rendered thy little Willie boy quite damp.  Second-day was still fine and wet so we fooled round the house most of the day.  In the morning we read a couple of Kenneth Grahame's "Dream Days" stories, and they certainly are pretty good.  We also read a crazy story by Paul [---] entitled "Love Will Find a Way" and "The Maltese Cat" by Rudyard Kipling.  In the afternoon we tried to take a sail but failed as Father had told the captain he could have a holiday.  However we went up to Whitall's and Greta and Alg and I went out  in a row-boat with a sail in it.  The little craft went sideways pretty nearly as fast as it did forwards so we did not get very far.  The rest of them went out in the rowboat and took a row.  This morning was cloudywhen we got up, but we had decided to go on a picnic over to Gilbert Stuart's so we did and before we had fairly started the sun shone forth in all his grandeur and we had a fine day.  I took Colin along and he behaved very well and seemed to enjoy it though he was pretty tired before we got home.  Altogether we walked about thirteen miles so thee sees we had plenty of exercise.  After lunch we walked back toward Kingston and got a good view of the country.  We had to hustle back to catch the five-thirty boat, but when we got to Saunders town we found we had time enough to eat some ice cream at a fair that was going on behind the hotel.  We walked over from the West Ferry and then Joe, Art, Alg and I took a short swim at Whitall's.  It is getting pretty late, the news and this sheet are rapidly coming to a close and I am tired so good night.With lots of love for both thee and Anna
   I am as ever
   Harold
   
   Please give my love to Miss Richardson.  Katherine and Jacquee say to thank thee very much for thy letter.  If any of you think of it you can remember me to the Leeds and the Hodges.  Tell me about the tournament and give my congratulations to the young Miss Hodge if she won.

Title: 1907 July 11, Chester, to Grandparents

Chester
   July 11th, 1907
   
   My Dearest Grandparents, 
   
     I have been meaning to write to you for some time, but somehow have not got it done so far, with the exception of one poor postal. 
    
   Well, we have been having the best kind of a time. The voyage was most enjoyable for there were some very jolly people on board and there was lots of deck-room for games. 
   
    Since landing we have had a good deal of rainy weather but we don't seem to mind rain at all, and it has not interfered with our plans except once or twice when we have taken the coach instead of walking in the rain. The cold too, for it has been pretty chilly at times, has been rather a blessing than otherwise for it has made our walks and sightseeing tours all the more enjoyable, and the soft coal fires have been very nice and cheerful. 
    
   Our trip through Devonshire was a great success, though we can scarcely call it a walking trip as we walked only two days instead of four. From London we went straight to Tintagel, arriving there Seventh day evening. The cliffs are perfectly magnificent and we spent most of First day morning admiring them from King Arthur's Castle which is on a beautiful promontory. Finding it was impossible to get our bags to Bude on the Sabbath we took the only course open and drove there,  taking them with us. It was disappointing to miss the walk, but we had the more time at Tintagel of which we were very glad. Bude was rather uninteresting, but the walk from there to Clovelly is certainly charmingly quaint, though the tourists have, I suppose, come in such swarms that it seems as though the place were artificially natural (if you can guess what I mean by that). From Clovelly we went to Ilfracombe by boat and thence we coached to Lynton. Here again we had expected to walk but were again prevented, this time by rain. Lynton and Lynmouth took my fancy very much, and Paul Brown and I had a delightful walk up the Valley of the Lyn to Watermeet (where the East and West Lyn come together)The next day we walked to Porlock in spite of the rain.  We were very fortunate, however, and each time a shower overtook us we were able to reach shelter.  The dark, low-flying clouds with here and there a burst of sunshine rather added to the wildness of Exmoor and it was not hard to imagine that the Doones might almost still be living in some of the wild valleys.  We saw a herd of the wild Exmoor ponies but were not fortunate enough to see any of the red-deer which we were told at Porlock are not at all uncommon.  From Porlock we went to Tintern by train.  It was a rather tedious journey with a good deal of waiting.  The two place are only about thirty miles apart in a straight line, but it took us six hours toreach our destination.
   
   Tintern Abbey is a fine old ruin and takes you back to the Middle Ages, giving the whole town an air of antiquity.  The little chapel on the hill, which they say is older than the abbey was also very interesting and we spent last Seventh-day morning (till train time) wandering around them and taking pictures of them.
   
   We came straight to Chester from Tintern, and I must say I was rather disappointed in it.  The Cathedral is fine but the Walls do not amount to very much it seems to one.  We left here First-day evening and went to Carnarvon where we were very much interested in the Castle which dates I believe from 1256.  At Carnarvon the rain again interfered with our walking, and this time it rained so hard that the coach did not run and we were obliged to go to Bedd-gelert by train.  In some ways Bedd-gelert appeals to me more than most of the places we have seen.  It is such a quiet little town, "far from the madd'ning crowd's ignoble strife," nestled in the heart of the Welsh Mts, that I felt I should like to have more time there.  In the afternoon it stopped raining and we walked down the Pass of Aberglaslyn where they say the cliffs rise eight hundred feet from the road.  It is especially fine now as the recent rains have filled the streams very full and the little brooks tumbling over themselves down the mountainsides are very beautiful.
   
   When we awoke the next morning we were again greeted by the pleasant patter of rain, but we decided to walk to Beltus-y-coed at any rate.  I am very glad we did as it soon stopped raining and it was a very pretty walk.  At Capel-Curig we again saw the king (we had seen him twice in London) this time in plain every-day clothes in an automobile, on his way to Carnarvon.  The people had gathered from far and near and greeted him enthusiastically.  I was interested to her them sing the Welsh national anthem in their native language, which is certainly most unintelligible.  This morning we returned here and this afternoon visited the Cathedral after which Arthur and I went to see Eaton Hall, the Duke of Westminster's place.  As he is now in London we were allowed to go over his house, of course for a shilling, (everything is for a shilling) and were very much interestedto see how he lives.  It is a most magnificent place, "rich but not gaudy" and somehow seems much more "fit" than some of the summer cottages at Newport, though I imagine, as far as money goes that Newport's "cozy little cottages" are quite as grand.  Eaton Park is a beautiful stretch of land about three miles (or more) long and the deer grazing in the open fields were very pretty.
   
   I have now come to the end of my letter, and as it is growing late I must close.  Please give a great deal of love to Uncle Tom and to Aunt C. and Uncle W and their family and keep a great great deal for yourselves
   from your loving grandson
   Harold.

Awbury
   9/30/1906
   
   Dear Mother, 
   
   It certainly does seem much more than two days since we parted from thee and Anna, Miss Richardson and Harold on the ferry wharf at Jamestown. I don't know why the time should seem so long but it is even hard to realize that only last Tuesday father and I were looking out over the Bay blue as could be in the sunlight of a splendid September day as we sat on the deck of the "General" on our way to Wickford. It seemed a great shame to spend so good a day in that stuffy parlor car.
   
   We got through the packing very comfortably, and (although father did say that in the middle of one night he thought we would never be able to get it all done) with very little worry I think. The only thing now is that none of the freight has yet come. We seem to be getting along very nicely on what we have brought.
   
   Since my arrival at home I have been to see two of my doctor friends. Dr. Van Pelt and Dr. Bassett the latter fixed me up without doing anything very much, a lucky escape for me because I haven't been to the dentist for over a year and Dr. Van Pelt is going to make an examination of my eyes with the aid of drops later on in the year. He goes away tomorrow and thought there would hardly be time to do it now. 
   
    Last sixth day afternoon Father and I took a drive. We went up through the Wissahickon, pretty as usual though the foliage hasn't changed much and then stopped at the Philadelphia Cricket Club grounds where I met Alg. And we had some tennis. Father seems pretty well I think and says he has enough to keep him busy in town for some time so perhaps it is just as well the freight hasn't come yet or he might try to do something at once.
    
    Yesterday I went up the  Rancocas with Harold, George and Esther, Eleanor Haydock and Anita Downing. I believe Harold thought some of the members of the house party wouldn't be able to go so did not try to get there to-gether this time. In spite of the fact that it was a threatening day and rained just as we reached the ferry and notwithstanding the fact that Harold and I forgot to eat any lunch we had a very nice time and escaped any wetting. It cleared up before we got back and the moonlight was beautiful. Our only accidents were, I think, that Esther [---] on the [---] of a very irascible old Irish woman in the trolley car who swore around at a great rate and was not at all mollified by Esther's apology. Then Eleanor dropped her umbrellaafter meeting broke up. John and Mary Emlen were there and altho. they tried to get off pretty quickly thee may be sure a lot of us caught them and detained them for a word or two.
   
    Alf. is coming to us for supper which will be very nice. Alg. is now reclining on the sofa reading and sends his love to thee and Anna and Aunt Lilly. Before I close I must ask if thee has heard of the latest engagement--Billy Haines to a Miss Janvier, of Orange, NJ and niece of Thomas Janvier who writes for the magazines somewhat.    
     [---] in Alg's message of love to you all and [---]

   My dearest Algie,
   I think thee is awfully good to keep on writing me such perfect letters, and when I got the last one, which was a dandy by the way, I just decided that thee deserved a letter and was going to get one too.  I suppose thee is up at Woodbourne now, having a fine time with Frank.  I can just imagine you getting up at some unearthly hour of the morning and kicking up such a row, so that nobody else can possibly sleep, because you have caught a mouse or some other poor little animal in a figure four.  I bet Aunt Carrie was mad when you waked her up, I remember she always used to be.  Tell Frank I was very much shack[---] to hear of his playing such a wicken trick on Aunt Carrie.  I hope he has been severely lectured for it.  I think he must be getting very wild.  I wish he would write me a letter, but I suppose he has so many other girls to write to he would hardly have time to spare a few minutes to me.  I suppose thee sees from the top of thisletter that we are in Venice at present, and I wish I could change places with thee for a minute or two, and let thee see what it is like.  I am not very good at describing things, as I guess thee knows by this time, if thee has [wadded?] through many of my stupid letters, however, I will do my best.  In the first place it is very beautiful and very different from anything else that I ever saw, or that anybody ever saw I guess.  The Gondolas are perfectly fascinating.  They are all painted black, and are long and narrow, with pointed ends curled up.  That's graphic, isn't it?  Never mind, I am going to draw thee a picture of one.There it is!  Thee sees the man stands at the back and works the boat with one oar.  It is more like paddling than anything else, only the man stands up and throws himself forward on  the oar each time.  It is a very graceful motion, and they do it beautifully feathering the oar each time.  I never saw anything like the way in which they guide the great long boats in and out among each other, and around sharp corners, without any collissions.  It is really wonderful.  Oh!  Algie!  Thee gave me such a scare about Colin.  I really criedwhen I heard he was lost.  and when I read thy next letter and found it was all right, I was too delighted for words.  Why I hardly said good-bye to the old fellow, and to think of not seeing him again nearly broke my heart.  Wasn't it queer his going off that way.  I hope he wont do it again.  We have gotten some lovely letters since I stopped writing and amoung them  was a paper tellingall about the Tennis Tournament, which Papa had sent to me.  I enjoyed reading it immensely, & got very much excited over the descriptions of the different matchs.  I felt almost as if I was there seeing them.  Some of them must have been fine.  I would love to have seen the one between Hovey and young Sears, it must have been awfully exciting.  I am sorry poor Huntington was not in it this year.  I am awfully glad he won the doubles anyway.  Campbell must have played beautifully and you must just have held your breaths all through the matchbetween him and Hobart.  From what I gathered it was intensely exciting, wasn't it?  I can just imagine how sorry you were when Hovey was beaten.  I know how broken hearted I was when Huntington was done up last year.  It must have been something the same, at least it says that Hovey gave out entirely in the end, and evidently was not well, and that was just the way with Huntington.  Now Algie, I must stop.  I guess thee is sick of hearing me talk about the tournament and will not be very sorry.  Good-night old boy!  Take a great big kiss and hug and all the love thee wants from
   Thy very, very loving Sister. P.S. Please give my best love to Agnes, and tell her I am waiting eagerly for a letter from her.  Why don't it come?  Give Ellie my love too, and tell her she is a perfect jewel to write to me, and that I will try and answer it if I can find time.

   Dearest Family, 
   
   I have so many things to thank you for & tell you about that I dont know hardly which to begin with.  First, dear Father, thank thee ever so much for all thy trouble in spending me my photos, etc.  I am afraid it was quite a bother, but I was so glad to get them & have enjoyed showing them to the different ones, as well as having them around my room.  And then the flowers!  They were & still are lovely, dearie, & thank thee ever & ever so much.  If you could all see my room now, I should have lots to show you, for I havehad a lot of presents lately!  My bureau is decorated with Fathers daffys & some beautiful roses Miss Wendell sent me last week, with such a swell little note saying she wanted to come & see me if Dr. Stedman would let her & I felt like seeing her.  I told her when I wrote that I certainly did& that Dr. Stedman was quite willing so I expect I may have a visit from her before long.  She has gone or is going away from home just now on her Mother's account.  You know her Father has just died.  Well to go on with my decorations.  Around my mirror ivy is twining (that sounds swell, doesn't it?).  Miss Barnard, one of thr patients have me a plant of it,as she heard me say I wanted one, & I am so pleased with it.  Then on my mantel are some of Father's roses, & the little daisies, & on my table a vase of pussy willows which Mary the waitress brought me, & what do you think? - a little bowl of gold fish!  Miss Stedman brought them to me the other day, &they are so pretty- I think it was very sweet of her, & of them all, & I feel very rich with so many things given to me.  The gold fish are quite an object of interest.  Dr. Shine appeared this morning with a long pole with a line & bent pin dangling from it, & I had to rescue them from his clutches!  He is great fun, & I came up stairslast evening with my side fairly aching from laughter.  Oh, I forgot in my [---] to mention the dear little witch Aunt Lilly sent me.  She brought it in the witch house in Salem, & it is very cute. 
   
   Now what do you think I have been doing this week?  Wouldnt you be surprised to hear I had been to Boston to see some pictures?  It's all true, though.  Last Monday Miss Webb & I went in to the exhibition of "Fair Children" at Copley Hall, & I certainly enjoyed it.  We didnt stay long & I was very much pleased that I didnt get more tired.  Copley Hall is quite near the Back Bay Station so we didnt waste much time getting there.  It is jolly beinglanded so near the Library & the Art Museum & all, for it will be so easy to reach them.  I saw the Brunswick.  It was funny, as we weren't on the street but about 15 minutes all together & met very few people, that one of them should happen to be Bishop Mc[---], & that I should so have the pleasureof speaking to someone I know. 
   
   I have decided to finish this letter up & send it this afternoon, instead of [---] till some other day.  This means I must say good by now, however & leave the rest till another time.  I have some very nice letters to thank you for.  A perfect daisy from thee, Father with lots of news, & a [---] nice one from Alg, with ditto ditto.  I am not sure I ever thanked thee either for the one thee wrote last week, which thee started by saying that thee was sleepy & it would probably suffer.  I dont know how much more brilliant it would have been if thee had been more awake, but I certainly did not find it in the least stupid!I hope thee is [---] all right again, dear old Benjamin.  Thee has my sympathy, though it is rather late for that I fancy, & I hope thee hasn't needed it much all along.  Does thee remember when we had the real measles together? 
   
   And now with a great deal of love to you all Father, Alg, Ted, Ern, [---] & thee too, dearest little Mother, for they will send this to thee, I suppose I am
   your very loving
   Daughter  & Sister

May the eighth

Dearest Grandma,
I thought thee might like to see these little pictures, although this place is too beautiful for pictures to do it justice.  You lose the height, & also the color, which is very lovely- partly because of the red soil & partly, I expect, on account of the wonderful lights & shadows.  Yesterday afternoon a shower swept across the water toward us with a rainbow in its midst & theeffect against a dark background of clouds was beautiful.  I know how thee would love & enjoy it all, & I long to send it across to thee.  The streams are very rocky & swift & the fresh delicate [---] of the [---] along their banks makes a beautiful picture.  The primroses are exquisite- so delicate, but I have not seen any violets like ours at Awbury!

Miss R. wants me to give thee her love.  She has thy little pincushion hanging by our mirror & we feel quite decorated!  Please give my dear love to Grandpa & to Uncle Tom & Uncle Hazen & Aunt Margaret.  Also to Aunt Anna & Aunt Carrie if thee should think of it.  With a great deal for thyself, I am thy very loving Anna.Lynton Cottage Hotel,A Devonshire Lane, Nr Lynton.Allerford bridge.Salisbury, The Close, Pretty Corner.

   Knowing you will be glad to know of our whereabouts and our welfare I suggested this afternoon to Chellie that I should write to thee dear mother-  We are now seated on the balcony overlooking the Hudson and enjoying ultimately the lovely view and thoughts of the dear ones left at Germantown-
   
   But to go back to where our sixth day letters left off-  It was then our intention to have gone to Overlook yesterday.  But Chellie woke up with a headache and as the boat left pretty early in the morning we gave it up-  After breakfast Chellie feeling much better we concluded to come as far as this place and spend firtst-day here and go onto Overlook tomorrow.  Which plan we have thus far carried out-  Our ride up the Hudson was perfectly beautiful-  The afternoon being cool with just enough soft flucy clouds floating about to make the hills beautiful in light and shadow.  I have never been to Cozzens before and it certainly is a most delightful place-  The view is much more extended than from Roe's, (and seen when the Highlands are covered with the soft purple light of evening and the western sky filled with a gorgeously colored clouds or when softened by the moonlight pouring over the top of the opposite hills and silvering the waters of the Hudson), it is remarkably beautiful-  I hope you are having a share of the delightfully cool air we are enjoying today and I wish some of you at home and thee especially could be invigorated after all the fatigue both bodily and mentally thee has undergone within the past few weeks with its mountain pureness-
   
   Our plans for tomorrow are to leave here on the steamboat and go to  Rondout and go up the mountain the afternoon reaching the Hotel sometime in the evening-  As to what we have been doing I guess I had better follow Chellies advice and say nothing about it, as under the circumstances we should probably be laughed at whatever we did-  However I will tell thee, for I know it will meet thy approbation that we have kept pretty quiet that Chellie (and myself as to that) might rest-
   
   Chellie is going to add a postscript to this so must leave her some room so with a quiet deal of love to father Lily and all the rest at home I will
   conclude.  With much love I am thy
   affectionate  son
   
   J. Evans It seems hardly worth while, dear mother, to add to Jonathan's epistle for he has told about all there is to tell, but one thing he has not told thee, and that is what good care he has taken of this daughter of thine, how he writes on her as she has never been waited on before, until she tells him that she is afraid he will spoil her by making too much of her; though I hope there is no danger of that, and I don't truly think it will.
   
   We have so enjoyed our visit here, that I think it is just as well probably that we were detained, and spent our First-day here instead of at Overlook, and if we only have such lovely weather at the latter place as we have had here we can desire nothing better. With much love to father Lilly, Hazen, my dear little sisters and all, I remain thy loving daughter

Overlook 6mo 10th 73
   
   My dear brother
   
   It was very nice upon our arrival here yesterday to find thy letter awaiting us, and as it was the first tidings we had from home we were not long in opening it-  We were very glad to learn that you thought of sending cake to the various persons, as in the multitude of other things we never thought of that-  [---] have received our West Point letters, I hope, and know of our doings or rather of our goings up to that time-  The next morning we left at half past eleven in the Daniel Drew.  The weather was pretty warm but when we got on the boat we had a nice breeze-  The Drew maintains her old expectation for speed, and running at the rate of eighteen or twenty miles an hour soon brought us to Rhinebeck which is opposite of Rondout-  We got our dinner on the boat, and were seated at a table with a party of Irish people who amused us very much.  As soon as seated they ordered of one of the waiters "three plates of roast beef" which they continued to order of the various waiters as they passed.  The waiter of our table having gone out after our dinner of course none of the others paid any attention so them and they waited for some time, whereupon they began to talk in a very funny way-  When our waiter came they asked him how soon they were going to get their dinner.  He said they had not ordered yet whereupon they waxed quite pathetic and said they could not tell who they ordered it of but they had ordered of three or four and they all looked just alike- when we left they were comforting themselves with roast beef but were grumbling that they were missing all the beautiful scenery-  When wereached Rhinebeck we found the boat "The Lark" (peculiar name is it not for a boat but we thought in our case rather [---] for this occasion as we felt inclined for going on "a Lark") waiting and were soon landed at Rondout-  Here we had to walk about a square to the depot, depot did I say, no, I dont mean that, but to the street corner from which the cars start-  Thee would have been amused to see the manner of conducting the railroad-  The told us the cars started from that corner and the train would be ready in a few minutes-  Some time after the time for starting we saw the engine coming from down toward a wharf and were not a little surprised to see a horse car coming towards us from the opposite direction upon the same track.  It occurred to us we would just as leave be where we were as in either- but when they got close to=gether they stopped and did not attempt pass upon the same trackChellie asked out Conductor if they used the same track promiscously and he relieved our minds by saying "no"-  After we left Kingston the car was pretty full and some of the people were real characters.  The front seat in our car was occupied by a real old fashioned farmer and his wife .  Presently a man came though the car and stopped and spoke to him very hard and then it seemed all of sudden to dawn upon him who he was and he hollared ? out "How'd you do my hearty" and pulled him down on to the seat with his wife and himself-  The poor little woman was almost crished and the whole thing was very amusing in the reality, more so I am afriad than I have made it seem.  Afterward the two men went to another seat and the farmer sat with his arm around the other mans neck in a most affectionate manner-  As Chellieis writing home very fully and as [---] is rather scarce, I am afraid I shall [repent?] so well bid thee farewell-  Please give my love to father and mother Lilly and my two little sisters and with a large share for thyself I am thy attached bro

Title: 1873 July 26, London, to brother

London 7 mo 26th 73
   
   Dear brother
   
   I have been intending for some time to write thee a letter but since our arrival in London there has been so much to do and so little time for writing that I have dont next to nothing in that line-  And now what shall I tell thee about for between Chellie and Tom both of whom have written I feel as if there was nothing left for me to say-  On fifth day last we went to the Zoological Garden and I do wish thee could have been along, we were very much amused as well as interested-
   
   The first thing that struck us in particular was the storks.  With their long legs (only one of which they stand upon at a time) their necks which they draw well down between their hunched up shoulders, their grave or rather I may say melancholy expression gives them a ridiculous appearance and when they gyrate or give a great jump as they sometimes do with no apparent object it was perfectly [inesistable]-  The monkey house also proved a place of no small amusement-  as we visited it about 11 o'clock I suppose it was the hour for the old monkies to be taking their morning naps however that may be a number of them were asleep-  One old ape amused us very much he was taking a nap upon one of the bars and apparently the last idea that had entered his head beforefalling asleep was that it would be desirable to scratch his head so he would raise his arm until his hand nearly reached his head and then down it would drop, this he repeated over and over again-  In another cage there were three asleep upon one of the roosts with their arms around each other0  In other cages there were the usual pranks and absurdities going on which monkies indulge in. 
   
   The keeper of the laughing hyenas was very obliging and gave us the opportunity of hearing "the very remarkable noise" which the song informs us the animal makes every fifteen minutes"- 
   
   In the snake house every thing seemed to be in a very quiet state most of the snakes being coiled up  under their blankets-  One or two of the Boa Constrictors were tied up in sundry knots and laid out on the tree to sun-  We saw quite as much of them as we care to snakes not being our favorites-  We next visited the Hippopotomi and Rhinoceros.  The former are the most ungainly looking animals I ever saw.  There is a little one only eight months old and altho' so young its body so much longer than an ox.  The keeper brought some grass to feed them and made them open their mouths-  But I will stop for I am afraid I have said too much already about animals-  I think thee would be very amused at some of the servants we see here the absurd way they are dressed-  Not unfrequently5
   we see footmen with drab coats with brass buttons, crimson breeches, white stockings, low shoes and with either white wigs or powdered hair-
     
   The other day I saw an old fashioned coach by an old fashioned coach I mean one driven in the style of olden time four horses with a guard who had a long horn which he was blowing as they drove through the streets.  I believe it is owned and driven by a young lord who having plenty of money and a fancy for that sort of thing amuses himself in this way-  He has men to attend to all the money matters and to the passengers while he just drives-  Yesterdat we went out to the Crystal Palace and spent most of the day there-  It is a wonderful place so much to see-  It is something like our Sanitary Fair was, if thee remembers that, only on a larger scale.  We went around until we were very tired and then we dined.  After dinner we continued out investigations visiting amongst other things the "[---] animals"- These are large creatures made to represent what they suppose some of the extinct species were like-  They are placed about among the trees and on the edge of one of the lakes in natural positions but it struck us there was a good deal of humbling about it-  One sixth day evening last Tom, Rueben, & I went to Parliament-  We couldnot get seats for Chellie and H as they told us they were often engaged a week ahead in the ladies gallery-  We had rather an amusing experience-  We reached the hall about five minutes of nine and were told we would have to wait for a few minutes as the  House was just being made up.  We were seated with a number of others upon benches in the Hall and after waiting for sometime the first was told it might go in and then the second-  We passed up a long flight of stairs and went into a little toom where our tickets (which Tom had purchased from a man in the afternoon) were examined we were in a bitter trepidation while this was going on as we did not know whether they were good for anything or not, however they passed us- As soon as weentered the gallery the janitor came to us and pointed us to seats into which we sank he then told us we must park our hats under the seats, then he turned to another man and told him he must not raise up to see, then he made another man put his umbrella upon the seat behind him not allowing him to hold it in his hand so if he had ordered us to pull off our shoes I should not have been surprised- We heard three or four speeches upon the Army bill and were very much amused-  Every once in a while the speakers would get rather muddled and there would come a succession of aws and grunts and hesitations which was absurd-  And then there were occasional mysterious sounds which at9
   last we discovered was applause in the shape of hear! hear!-  How they made such sounds I dont know it was a kind of mingled mumble and rattle it put me in mind of the child that swallowed the bead necklace-  We stayed until nearly half past eleven and then concluded we had got nearly two shillings worth and would go. 
   
   This morning we went to Westminster meeting and were not a little surprised upon going into see Chas & Anna Sharples and their daughter-  After meeting we had quite a talk with them and learn that they are going to sail on the second of next mo:-  They have visited Vienna Switzerland France &c [---] trip ideed-  We also met Wm Bradford (the Artist) who is spending the summer in London) he was very kind and invited us to come to his studio-  Bevan Braithwaite was at meeting and pressed us to come and see him when we return a very warm hearted Friend.  We expect to leave tomorrow for the north-  Tell mother we are all pretty well-  Please give a great deal of love to father and mother and each one of brothers & sisters.  Tell them none must feel slighted when letters are not addressed to them individually for all our letters are intended for all.  Please give love to them at Uncle Johns & Toms also at School Lane.  Chellie joins me in message of love.  Please excuse this writing as I am using a quill pen which writes better on this paper than a steel one-  With much love I am thy affectionate brother

   My dear Mother
   
   Altho I have written to father and Tom has also written a long letter so that I am afraid they will be as uninteresting as "twice-told tales" yet I am going to send thee a few lines in a scrappy way for they own edification. We do so enjoy having Tom with us and he seems to be not only enjoying himself but improving--when he first joined us at London he looked very badly not having recovered from the sea voyage I suppose he was very pale and thin, but has been gaining pretty steadily so that now his cheeks have quite a color and he looks fuller in the face than I ever remember to have see him--I do not think his leg troubles him much, as he says it does not hurt him, and he walks about a good deal--we shall try to keep him from doing too much--
   
   I think Chellie seems stronger than when we left home, as she is certainly able to walk more and does not get as fatigued as she would at home--
   
   She has gained some flesh but is not what you would call stout yet. For a day or two her throat has been a little swelled, but I shall get her some [tannin?] or a gargle and I think that will relieve her. I have written [---] particularly in regard to health as I know thee would like to know. The weather except a few days in London has been cool so that we have generally not been able to wear our [thin?] clothes. Chellie has not found her waterproof dress to wear for traveling and now that we are going north shawls are called into acquisition. Evening 9.05. I wish thee could look in upon us this evening and see how snugly we are fixed, seated around a centre table in our cosey little parlor with four candles burning upon on the table and at this point Tom came in and proposed we should take a row upon the lake in the moonlight and as it was a lovely evening we went and now have just returned--I did wish for some of the girls form Awbury for it was so perfectly beautiful that even the [staid manied?] people almost grew sentimental--The lake was just rippled by the gentle wind and the moon was hanging over the western mountains throwing a silvered path across the water, and on the shores we could dimly see the outlines of Wray Castle and the pretty residences with which the shores are studded, and in which the lights were brightly shining. The rain which continued most of the day stopped toward evening and although the roads were rather muddy we started out for exercise and had a pleasant walk of three miles toward Bowness. [---] tt has cleared we expect to start early tomorrowmorning for Keswick. As this letter is for thy information on little points in travels I will tell thee of our general hours. We find it suits us best not to dine later than three or half past and so whether we take our dinner at the hold or elsewhere try to have it at that hour. We breakfast generally at half past eight and then take tea at half past seven or eight and spend our evening in our sitting room either writing home or in journals or in talking over the scenes of the day and planning for the morrow. In traveling we generally manage to have a car to ourselves and Reuben looks after the baggage and Tom eitherkeeps him or assists Chellie and H, while I am buying our tickets-  We get along very nicely indeed-  In the last letters thee said that some of them at home thought "thee was writing too much", I hope thee will not stay thy hand on that account, but only as thy strength will warrant, for I can assure thee every detail of home news is very interesting-  We think of you very very often and I hope the time may come when thee will enjoy the beauties which we are visiting, but altho the present is so full of enjoyment the future (when we shall return to your midst) looks very pleasant.
   
   The little books dear mother, which thee gave us just before leaving are our constant compantions in our travels and it is pleasant to think as we read them morning and evening that thee too has them and altho the time may be different yet we read them the same day-  I enclose a little bunch of wild flowers which I picked while visiting Swarthmore part of them I gathered at the meeting house and part from the Hall, I wish they were better preserved but they were pressed under difficulties in my pocketbook and I had to arrange them for pressing as we walked.  I send them thinking thee might like a little memento of Swarthmore-  I am afraid this will prove a scrappy letter and rather uninteresting for it is madeup of little nothings-  Hannah desires her love to thee and the rest of the Awbury family-  When thee sees them at School Lane please give them my love also a great deal to all at home and at Uncle Toms and Uncle John's, Chellie has retired or would join me in these messages-  With much love I am thy loving son
   J.Evans.
   P.S.  I dont know if any mention has been made of how Reuben is and as his father and mother were rather anxious about him when we left, will thee tell them that I think he is much better, but would improve faster if he took more rest especially in writing his letters and journal as he often sets up late and is up early-

   My dear Mother
   
   I hope this evening that no one has written home for a day or two and know thee will like to hear often so I will send a few lines this evening before the mail closes.  We have had a very warm day the thermometer standing at 83 [degrees] a good deal of the time and there has been very little air stirring-  This morning Mary, Alexis Alf, John Hazen and Henry made an excursion to the top of Kate's Mountain.  They had an early breakfast and got off about 8 oclock and did not get back until nearly one.  They had a pretty rough scramble and some how did not get to the right place and so missed the view-  I was glad they went as they thought it paid and I am afraid they find it rather monotonous-  The life is a very lazy one and while it is so warm in the middle of the day there is very little to be done in the way of excercize, with any comfort-  I think Alf seems better and the water suits him but Hazen is not able to drink the sulphur water and does not seemed to have impreoved as much as I hoped he would-  I do not mean that he is sick but he still looks pale.  He seems bright and much less nervous than when he left home and I hope he will improve more after his return-  Lily has bathed twice (yesterday and today) having her bath at about 100 [degrees] and says she thinks it suited her for after lying down she felt refreshed and better-  but of course it is too soon for there to be much change-  She stayed in the first day only about 2 minutes and today 5 so thee sees she is feeling her way.
   
   This afternoon Lily and Alexis took a drive-  I have been disappointed 3
   in the air here it is not bracing at all-  and as the mountains are all around us often we get but little breeze-
   
   The daily routine of our life here is not thrilling-  We rise about half past seven and it is often half past eight before we get assembled at the breakfast table-  After breakfast (which we rarely get through until quarter past nine) we walk around the grounds for a little while visiting the spring, Japanese Store, Post Office &c and then spend the time until 11 o'ck (when we bathe) either in reading, writing or talking-.  After the bath we put in the time as best we may until dinner time 2 O'clk.  After dinner we set out under the trees upon the lawn or upon our piazza and read aloud or talk until tea time and after tea we generally take a walk and then sit in the parlor until bedtime "and thus our days go on, go on"  The boys vary it occasionally by a little walk upon their own account or by going swimming or sometimes we roll a game of ten pins-  I have gone very much into details and I have no doubt father and Tom will laugh at the letter and groan over such a life (so do I) but I thought these little nothings would interest thee and moreover there is very little else to tell-  Our movements in the future are very uncertain and as yet we cannot say when we shall home or whether some will remain- as soon as some conclusion is arrived at we will let you know.  Please give a great deal of love to father Tom Anna & Carrie in which Chellie would join me if she knew I was writing but I am in the gentlemans writing room and she does not know of it-  With much love for thyself I am thy loving son J.

   Having received a message from thee through a letter to Tom, and not being able to plead sickness as a reason for not writing, I am going to send thee a greeting-  Well we are not going to see thee until next spring, it seems a long time, and we were all of us not a little disappointed when the news came.  We were counting the days until the time when thee was to sail and beginning to speculate upon the probable length of the passage, when suddenly all our hopes were dashed-  I was going to say I would not flatter thee by telling thee what lamentations there were on the part of some of us, but I think it does no one harm to know how much they are loved and missed at home, on the contrary I think  to a young man it does good, tending perhaps to keep him out of some things by which he might otherwise be tempted-  Now for the scrape of news I can glean up-  Last fourth day Tom and I drove over to Haverford to bring away thy [chattels?]-  We arranged to go on third day, but on that day we had a regular old fashioned Nor'easter and it poured most of the day-  The next morning about nine oclock Tommy appeared at our house in the [---] with Lady and Eric (Harry having been laid up some time with sore feet) after getting some more warm wraps for it had cleared off quite cold when we started-  The roads were in a pretty miserable state of muddiness and as we undertook to go by the Lancaster road we almost stuck so to speak-  However we reached the College about half past eleven, and finding the students in recitation we went up stairs and explored-  We found all thy things had been moved out of thy room and were locked up in another closet of which the matron hadkey so she had to be hunted up-  We packed most of the books and some other things in a drawer which Tommy and I carried down to the front door Tommy saying it was "like carrying down a little coffin"-  We donated to Frank Haines a bottle of eye wash, a little bottle of carbolic acid and a few other valuables?-  Thus were the last rites performed-  We packed the books in the bottom of the wagon, and put the precious articles, around with we supposed tender associations ( clung , (a broken fan with names thereon &c) between folds of the down cover-  We drove home to dinner reaching Awbury about quarter of four-  We had a good laugh at Tom - one of the objects over was to bring home the hanging book shelf and we forgot all about it, and came home without it - which rankled in Tommy's breast-  By the way talking of Haverford does thee know they have raised a sufficient amount of money to enable them to build, and Samuel Alsop Jr told me it was decided to go ahead-  The day we werethere was the day before Thanksgiving day, and as I waited upstairs in the entry while Tom was hunting up the Matron I was amused at two of the students, one was in the hall down stairs and as the other came out I suppose from recitation - he announced the fact that they were going to have Turkey for dinner, whereupon there went up such a howl of rejoicing as almost upset me-  We hoped while at Haverford to have had time to have called upon Margaret Yarnall, but we spent to much time at Any Marys that we had not time.  I suppose you have heard that Ellis and M Yarnall are boarding at [---] during the Winter.  I am glad to hear they are vert comfortably fixed-  It seems an out of the way kind of place for them, a good deal away from most of the latter's friends, I should think she would long to have her daughter with her.  I do feel for them very much-  First day 12/5.  A week, my dear Afred, has passed since I commenced this letter yet it is not finished.5
   During the week we have been pained from day to day to hear of Uncle Alfred's increasing illness.  As early as the beginning of the week Dr Wister said he seemed to be failing, and on second day they telegraphed for James, they received an answer the next morning only saying "will come" and that is all they have heard.  Up to second day Uncle Alfred has been able to get over into the library, this he has accomplished with the aid of a man who has been staying with him at night for a number of weeks- assisting him to dress and undress.  One second day he was so much weaker that he had to remain in bed- and since then he has been gradually growing weaker and weaker, until yesterday afternoon about three o'clock he quietly passed away-  He does not seem to have had any acute disease-  His appetite almost entirely gave out, and he gradually weakened - with the exception of a pain in one of his lungs I do not think he has suffered any-  Since last first day Uncle Tom and John E Carter have been sitting up with him half of alternate nights, the nurse sitting up the other half.  Lilly and Edward have been staying over at Fairfield for the last day or two-  Yesterday morning having heard how he was the evening before Father, Uncle Tom and Aunt Lizzie went over there, the Doctor came soon after they arrived and said he did not think he could live but a few minutes.  They went up into his room (except Father who had gone on to town) and sat there for two hours awaiting the close- he seemed entirely conscious but lay perfectly still excepting once when he passed his hand through his hair as his custom was and once he put his hand under his head-  They went to dinner and a few minutes after dinner was over he passed away, no one but Aunt Rebecca, Lily and Edward being present.  Just at the close, there was a short spasm and then to him all was joy and peace and rest-  What a wonderful and glorious change it must be for him after a long life of ill health and suffering during which I suppose he could never have said he really felt well, to awake inthat Holy City none of whose inhabitants can say I sick and where "there shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, neither shall there be ay more pain: for the former things are passed away"-  Aunt Caroline seems to feel it very much, not having seen for some time except a few days ago, when hearing how sick he was she went out to see him, but ut was thought best for her not to go in the room or let him see her so she looked at him through the door-  The only remarks I have heard that Uncle Alfred made (though he probably said more which I have not heard) were that some days ago he told J.E.C. "that it made very little difference which way it ended" meaning his sickness-  To E. Allen who visited home within a few days, and as she was leaving said she supposed she should never see him on earth again and that she did not doubt but that the change would be a glorious one to him he replied "I have been forced to feel very quiet and peaceful"  I think those were the words he used-  The funeral is to be next third day at two oclock.  It will be a great trial I doubt not to James to find all over when hearrives - 
   
   Last sixth day Uncle Tom commenced his winter readings and it was said to have been a very interesting occasion-  Neither Chellie nor I was able to get there-  There is a good deal of stir in our City now over the meetings of Moody & Sankey-  They have fitted up the old freight depot of the Pennsylvania RR so that it will seat about eleven thousand and meetings are being held I think twice on week days and three times on first days - they are largely attended and from accounts some of them must be impressive.  I hope they may do good-
   
   I suppose Mother in her weekly letter told you that Hazen had sprained his ancle, turned it under him as he was rushing out of the side door to catch the train-  Tommy seems to think it was a mercy he sprained it as it will probably save him from something worse if he will only take warning.  He had to hold it up for nearly a week.  However he is about again now tho he says it feels weak.  Aunt Lizzie Brown is still down at Atlantic City where she has been for some 9
   weeks and from accounts does not seem much better.  Aunt Fanny went down last third day taking with her a maid to stay with aunt Lizzie-  I am afraid her sickness is a pretty serious one and not to be gotten over in a hurry.  The rest of them at Grandfathers are pretty well now-  Grandfather has had a cold but is better-  Aunt Martha Leeds I suppose you have heard is at the Frankford Asylum, and from last accounts was not much better in her mind and was also very sick with [---] in her head-  I dont know whether thee has heard or not that the new building at Haverford is to go up next year they having got enough subscribed to warrant them in commencing so Samuel Alsop Jr told me.
   
   Lillies letter from [---] arrived on sixth day last and we were very glad to hear of your being so comfortably and pleasantly fixed-  Please give a great deal of love to both Lilly and Alexis and tell them I often think of them both with much affection and truly it does seem a long long time since we parted with them.  I do hope the stay will do you all a great deal of good-  I am afraid you have missed some of our letters Chell and I both misunderstood and have been directing our letters to Brown-Shipley & Co Liverpool - and I am afraid they have not forwarded them-  I wrote not long ago a letter to thee and one to Lilly and Alexis enclosing a photograph of the baby to each-  If they have never come to hand I will send you another-  Harry has at last made up his mind to return to Minneapolis - he expects to start next fourth day.  I hope he will have a more prosperous time the coming year than he has had the last-  Upon looking over the forepart of this letter which I wrote a week ago I find I have mentioned about the building at Haverford in that so thee will please excuse my telling it again-  I dont feel like rewriting the letter-  Chell sends her love to you all in which I join and wish you "a merry Christmas" and "a happy New Year"-  I remain thy
   loving brother

   My Darling wife. Altho I sent thee a postal from NY this AM for I am going to post a few lines the afternoon. I reached Philada about half past one and found the weather very different from Newport. The thermo. hanging by my side as I write standing at between 85° and 86° and the air somehow feels lifeless. I came away in such a hurry at the last that I forgot several things. Tell Hazen we need not have hurried if we had know for I waited nearly an hour before the boat arrived. I carried of the Post office key which I enclose herewith. I think sister Ann has my pocket knife which I lent her yesterday morning and either Algie or Edward has my [rule?]. These last I do not need and you can keep them until I come on or until some one is coming this way. I forgot to tell thee that I wish that bucket of solution of [copperas?] poured down the kitchen sink and then lit John put about two double handfuls more of it into a bucket of water and let it stand for about a week and then pour that down and put about a pailful down any week. I wish thee would call and see Truman Pickham some evening as you come home from a ride and ask him about the well and the drains I went to see him but he was not at home and he is at work except after six in the evening or between 12 and 1 at noon. I had not time to call again. If the cow you have does not prove satisfactory get Hazen to see what Ward will rent his cow for he did not tell me definitely and if he would take 4.00 per week I would take her if this one does not prove satisfactory.I do hope my dearest thee will take things easy. I am afraid the care will be so much that thee will not gain much and please do remember that it is my special wish that thee shall either have extra help or have the washing done out or anything that will [unnerve?] thee. I wish I could be on hand to help and relieve this. I do hope you are all well and are getting on comfortably. If I was only sure that the well and the drains were all right, I should feel much more happy. I hope they are and have done all I know how. I fully intended to have brought on two of those [Appolinans?] bottles full of the well water for Reuben Haines to have examined. I wish theewould send them on by the first opportunity. Please give my love to the two Annas and Hazen and with lots for the dear children and thy own dear self. I shall try not to worry about you but leave you in the care of our loving Heavenly Father who I feel has been and is very good to us and to whom we should give our love and thanks. Here are kisses for the [---]. 
   Kiss Anna
   Kiss Algie
   Kiss Edward
   
   Farwell dearest from thy loving husband,

   My very dear wife, 
   
   I am writing at home before meeting so as to take the letter with us to meeting and mail it. This is a very cool morning the thermo at 6.40 standing at 56° and although it has grown considerably warmer since yet it is still quite cool. Oh! my dear how I wish I could see you I do love you so. I feel quite anxious to hear how you are but suppose I shall hear nothing now until I see Tom--I had indulged a vain hope that somehow I might spend the fourth with you but there is so much to do at the office that I could not leave just at that time but I am hoping I can get off so as to come on the latter part of the week, but don't count on it too certainly but I will if I anyhow can. They want me to spend the fourth down in Maryland and I think I shall although it will hardly pay as I shall not be able to go down until the 5 o'clock train third day evening or early fifth day morning. I enclose a letter I received from Kate this morning it came enclosed in one to Madgie. I do hope you are getting along comfortably and are all well--give my love to the family. I paid John's wife the $25 yesterday. Thee can tell him that they were all well.Mother had a postal yesterday from aunt E. Brown she is still at the [Rigi?] something and expects to stay there all summer she seemed in good spirits. I am ashamed to say that I have not been over to call upon the Newhalls yet but from reports they are very much pleased with the place. There mother seems stronger and sleeps better. I am afraid dearest my letters are very stupid- writing every day there is not much chance for a collection of news but then thee knows each one contains any quantity of love and sympathy and dearestI feel that we are growing nearer and dearer to each other all the time and it is such a comfort. Margaret is still at Awbury but expects to go home tomorrow-morning. The carriage has just come up so I must bring this to a sudden pull up.
   
   With dear love to the children and lots for thyself I am dearest they loving husband

My Dear aunt

I expect this   will be the last letter I shall write to thee this session   as the time is drawing near when we shall go home.  we are   now reviewing and it is not so hard as I expected it would   be  we have to be very industrious [about] our studies as   some of them are very hard particularly the history and I am   very much afraid I shall fail in that at examination as the   greater part of it I have not learned for I have not been in   that class, all the session.  Thomas Kite’s wife is here   spending a day or two and her daughter also.  I suppose thee   has heard of the little boy who has been so ill here he was   taken with the measles and that layed the foundation for the   consumption and after suffering for a long time he was taken   away at three o clock in the morning of the first of spring    we had no school on six or seventh day but we all went to   our school rooms and red our bibles and on seventh day   morning we were taken into see his corpse and he was buried on seventh day afternoon   his name was Nathan Comstock and he was an orphan he lived   in Lockport New York  he has a brother and sister here and   his sister is a lovely girl but I know very little about his   brother.  Benjamin Sharpless was here to thee funeral and he   asked me if I had ever seen him at Tommy Cope’s and I told   him no., but I have often heard of him.  I am looking for   uncle Samuel to come and see me as he has been away so long   and I think he might come to see me this session
Aunt   Lydia is not at all well she has a very bad cold and a good   deal of pain in that lump on her face and she keep her bed   the greater part of the day but she is rathe better at   present than she has been lately  I think she would of been   better if she had not of gone down to supper last night   through the cold entry.  I have some things to write for and   I do not think I shall have any more time to write to thee.

He has beguiled some of the hours of his confinement      in doors, by reading “Rollo’s vacation” to me – & we have      found it quite entertaining –  I think it arrived just at      the right moment –  So much for Thomas –.  now for Willie –      with whom I am becoming better acquaintedas the ice is now broken – & he frequently pays us a visit      in our parlor –  He tells me – he is more comfortable than      formerly – & that the cause of his unhappiness is re-moved –      what this cause was, I do not know – but he looks so      pleasant & happy that I am inclined to believe he is not      depressed by any great weight of troubles –  They are very      different boys but both have found means to interest me      warmly for them – & I think I shall not soon cease to love      them – Tom is sitting by me begging me to proceed – but the      end of my paper warns me that I may already have tired thee      – therefore will take the hint after desiring my love to thy      mother – and assuring thee of

I      promised thy little brother to add a postscript to his      letter, inasmuch as he thought he should be unable to fill      the sheet – but he has left me so much room that I believe I      shall have to call in William’s aid to clothe the preceding      page –  Thos. has been in the parlor for a day or two, in      consequence of a bruise he has received on his eye –  It was      occasioned entirely by an accidental blow from a stick in      the hand of one of his companions, & seem’d at first rather      disposed to be troublesome – but by a faithful application      of lead-water yesterday it is nearly recovered – so nearly      that it occasions no inconvenience, & is but slightly      discoloured –  He seems to think that eye is particularly      unfortunate, as it is the same one which was hurt some time      ago –  I do not think thy mother need feel uneasy about it,      as we shall try to take all necessary care of him, if any      more is needed –  In regard to being careful himself, he      needs some few cautions, tis true – but I will tell it to      his credit, that for an active, adventurous little boy he is      very well disposed to take advice – & when he makes promises      to adopt it, is, I believe, very scrupulous in fulfilling      them.  He has beguiled some of the hours of his confinement      in doors, by reading “Rollo’s vacation” to me – & we have      found it quite entertaining –  I think it arrived just at      the right moment –  So much for Thomas –.  now for Willie –      with whom I am becoming better acquaintedas the ice is now broken – & he frequently pays us a visit      in our parlor –  He tells me – he is more comfortable than      formerly – & that the cause of his unhappiness is re-moved –      what this cause was, I do not know – but he looks so      pleasant & happy that I am inclined to believe he is not      depressed by any great weight of troubles –  They are very      different boys but both have found means to interest me      warmly for them – & I think I shall not soon cease to love      them – Tom is sitting by me begging me to proceed – but the      end of my paper warns me that I may already have tired thee      – therefore will take the hint after desiring my love to thy      mother – and assuring thee of

Dear sister

I hope you are      all well, My cold is quite well.  Freind Mary Davis sends      her love to Mother.  I am glad to hear that Aunt Ann is so      much better and, I hope that she will continue so, and I am      glad also that thee is getting well enough to walk out  How      is Aunt Hannah and uncle Thos, and Harry  Where is Williams      slipers  I think ought to be done.  It snowed last night      there a little.  The green house is nearly finished but the      plants are not yet aranged. we have had some pretty good      sleding.

I      promised thy little brother to add a postscript to his      letter, inasmuch as he thought he should be unable to fill      the sheet – but he has left me so much room that I believe I      shall have to call in William’s aid to clothe the preceding      page –  Thos. has been in the parlor for a day or two, in      consequence of a bruise he has received on his eye –  It was      occasioned entirely by an accidental blow from a stick in      the hand of one of his companions, & seem’d at first rather      disposed to be troublesome – but by a faithful application      of lead-water yesterday it is nearly recovered – so nearly      that it occasions no inconvenience, & is but slightly      discoloured –  He seems to think that eye is particularly      unfortunate, as it is the same one which was hurt some time      ago –  I do not think thy mother need feel uneasy about it,      as we shall try to take all necessary care of him, if any      more is needed –  In regard to being careful himself, he      needs some few cautions, tis true – but I will tell it to      his credit, that for an active, adventurous little boy he is      very well disposed to take advice – & when he makes promises      to adopt it, is, I believe, very scrupulous in fulfilling      them.  He has beguiled some of the hours of his confinement      in doors, by reading “Rollo’s vacation” to me – & we have      found it quite entertaining –  I think it arrived just at      the right moment –  So much for Thomas –.  now for Willie –      with whom I am becoming better acquaintedas the ice is now broken – & he frequently pays us a visit      in our parlor –  He tells me – he is more comfortable than      formerly – & that the cause of his unhappiness is re-moved –      what this cause was, I do not know – but he looks so      pleasant & happy that I am inclined to believe he is not      depressed by any great weight of troubles –  They are very      different boys but both have found means to interest me      warmly for them – & I think I shall not soon cease to love      them – Tom is sitting by me begging me to proceed – but the      end of my paper warns me that I may already have tired thee      – therefore will take the hint after desiring my love to thy      mother – and assuring thee of

I want very much to see you, I hope you   will come and pay us a visit, I am still Favoured with   Health, and that you may enjoy that Blessing is the Desire   of your affectinate Grandmother
Rachel DrinkerDear Cousins

Our dear Grandmother is Kind enough to   permit me to add a few lines to her letter–  I wish it was   in my power to communicate to you something that would   afford pleasure.  But alas!  I have lived to see the   melancholy period that death has seperated from me one of   the best of mothers, whose affection I believe I possessed;   and that I loved her with sincere affection, affords me no   small share of consolation–  She suffered much during her   illness, but such was her Christian fortitude that she never   discovered the least impatience, and constantly maintained   her usual cheerful serenity of mind, which was her   characteristic through a life of trials.  It was painful to   see her suffer so much bodily pain, but infinitly more so to   see her breath her last, a[l]though she suffered not the   pangs of death, but passed from this terrestrial world to   one where peace, happiness and pleasure reign triumphantly;   and where she now enjoys the blissful harvest of a spotless   and well spent life–  Such has been the immutable decree of   heaven to deprive me of an affectionate Mother and you an   affectionate Aunt– We are still blest with having our dear   Grandmother to cheer us–  She enjoysher usual health, which I hope she may enjoy for years to   come–
The last letter we received from Arthur states that   he and Cousin Henry are both well, and expect to leave the   West Indies very shortly; we of course expect them   daily–
Uncle is at present in good health, and I hope   will long continue so; here I must close this short epistle   and hope that I will see you before long –  I remain your   affectionate

Bridgewater Cottage
8.14. ’05 —

My very dear   friends –
I was very glad to hear again of you,– tho’   sorry to learn of your semi-invalidism,– in which I can   fully sympathise,– but I am overwhelmed – by your generous   check – which was so thoughtful – & so useful! –  I cannot   express myself with sufficient gratitude, & can only say   that it is accepted in the same loving spirit in which it   was sent, & for the inherited friendship of our re-spective parents & grandparents.–
– Did you ever know, or   hear among your family traditions of the strong intimacy   there was between yr. grandfather,– Thomas P. Cope – the   shipping merchant,– & my grandfather – Philip Price the   Superintendent of Westtown School, nearly 100 yrs. ago?–  My   grandfather had a large family of 10 children to educate &   c.– & when his eldest son,– Dr. Wm. Price rec.d his   diploma,– yr. grandfather gave him a double position on one   of his ships going to China,– those of Dr. & also of   supercargo,– & he made 2 trips,– each for 3 yrs,–  It was a   great event in the P. family
I am glad you are having a   pleasant summer in your quiet retreat.–  I am preaching "the   simple life"– more as weknew it in our quiet country homes, or in the simplicity of   Friends.–  I enjoy social life in a quiet way with good   neighbors & a few friends calling in the evenings – but the   constant round of it all day & every day is wearing.
–   What halcyon days we used to have at Woodbourne,– and my   children have no knowledge of it &, only the older ones –   have a bare recollection of dear Cousin Sarah, with none at   all of your lovely Mother.–  What a sunbeam she was!–  I   have some lovely memories to look back upon, but I don’t   seem to acquire in my old age the gentle loveliness of so   many of our old Friends, tho’ I am frequently called upon to   say with a dear old cousin of my Mother’s – Priscilla   Townsend,– (whowas the Mother of the Dentist Elisha K. Townsend who   founded the Philada. Dental College–) "Let me number my   blessings!"–  And another saying of an old Irish neighbor we   had – who had many trials & sorrows – but would end up her   stories with – "but sure, Welcome be the Will of the   Lord!"–
– But I am too reminiscent for young people, &   this letter is terribly egotistic, so I will stop but your   kindness & dear Annette’s letter have brought back many   delightful memories.–  The years are rapidly rolling by, & I   have now entered my eightieth. –
Good bye,– with dear   love to you both & many thanks I remain
your old   friend

My Dear Cousin Jonathan Evans

Thine of   yesterday is at hand--I am not sorry I wrote to thee as thy   answer assures me there was misapprehension on my part as to   thy expression. We had spoken of the discipline at Westtown   and of the laying aside of rules there and at Haverford   which were difficult of enforcement and some of them   unnecessary to proper order. Afterwards, if I recollect   right, thee expressed thyself in favor of rescinding all   rules, the word discipline being used; which I supposed   referred to that of our Y.Mg. when I now think the   discipline at Westtown may have been in thy mind.
I am   glad to be corrected, and to have thy opinion of the Revised   Discipline as given in thy letter.--I greatly long
to have unity of belief and effort in upholding essential   Truth and its principles by Friends, and increased   recognition of the intent of our Lord and Master when He   taught His followers the deep meaning of "The Kingdom of   Heaven."
Some few practices of the most substantial   Friends I am willing to leave to individual conscience for   adoption, if their rejection does not contravene any plainly   stated law or principle in the New Testament.  Thus in   dress, simplicity is conformity to the law of Christianity;   and truthfulness is necessary to speech when addressing   others.

With love thy cousin

Awbury Dec. 11th 1863

Here’s a nice stormy 6th day   afternoon at last, My dear Cousin Clementine, in which I can   find a little time to write to thee, I expect thee thinks I   am very naughty indeed not to have found a little time   before, but if I had thee here I could so completly convince   thee in half an hour, that thee would entirely agree with   me, that it is a moral impossibility ever to get any time to   write letters.  We have learned a great many things   Angelica, since last I had the pleasure of conversing with   thee, (I wonder how many months it has been) Yardley as well   as Mary Haines has become ourinstructor, other-wise intelligently he is teaching us to   ride, thee don’t know what fun it is, we have splendid   times,  Yardley & one of his daughters always goes, &   sometimes Tom or Reuben, & Cousin Lillie, Jammy or Casper, &   very rarely Tom Stokes, however I believe Yardly don’t   approve of him as Rachel & he behaved badly the other   afternoon riding too far ahead for Yardley’s notions, so he   came posting over in the evening & held a private   conversation on the piazza with father, to R’s extreme   disgust & indignation.  I suppose thee has heard of our   charities over at the meeting house, we have got up some   contraband meetings for the benefitof the “Young Friends Association” they have a man to cut   out the things, & then they are sent round to the various   meetings to be made up.  We have a branch concern here every   3rd day evening & have a great deal of fun, especialy after   Yardley & his daughters leave, we get tired of our work by   that time, & have a little music “both vocal &   instrumental”.  
But the last & greatest fun, that we   have now, is skatting, Oh! Cousin Clem, I do wish thee would   come over, yesterday afternoon was grand, I haven’t enjoyed   any thing so much for ages, the ice was delightfully smooth,   & my skates elegantly sharp, & they glided over so swiftly,   as to give metwo or three pretty hard tumbles.  Some of the gentlemen   rolled splendidly, the Sun in particular he was one of the   best skaters on the dam.  Compositions are as horrid as   ever, imagin my having to write one last night in addition   to all my other lessons after I got home, with my head full   of every thing else; I missed thy help very much, does thee   remember how thee used to give me ideas, last winter.  O!    Cousin Clem I wish thee would come back again.  We had the   nicest walk last 1st day afternoon that ever was, we went   all round by Harpers & Butlers dams thee knows, a whole   party of us Stokes & Awbury folks in addition toMiss A.C. Smith, I said we had a delightful walk, & so we   had as far as the walk went, but I believe I wasn’t in a   very good mood to enjoy, however I am not going to tell thee   about my mopy fits, I never have them now, ever since I had   that talk with thee at Newport I determined to have nothing   more to do with them; & I was dreadfully provoked at myself   for indulging last first-day afternoon, I beleive a   conversation I had in the morning rather effected my   spirits.  But how foolish I am!  thee’ll think I haven’t   improved a bit if I go on rattling about myself this way.    But CousinClementine thee will have to come over here right-soon, or I   shall begin to think we are never to see thee again.  
I   was very much obliged for thy photograph, though I must say   I can’t flatter thee on it thee way Uncle Harry did, whats   thee think he said about it?  he was looking over my album,   & when he came to it he said to me “thats a fancy piece aint   it”.  I laughed & told him who it was, & he said “it was so   pretty it ought to be put in the stores in Chestnut St.”    wasn’t that complementary now?  But I don’t think it is near   pretty enough to be put in Chestnut St. nor do I think it at   all does thee justice, & I hope thee won’tforget thee has promised me one of those really pretty ones.   But now I geuss thee is beginning to be quite tired of my   nonsense so I will close; hoping thee will answer this very   soon in person

ever thy affec. little Lily

My Dear Annie

That   thy very interesting letter has thus long remained   unanswered has been that I have not very often thought of   thee, as I trust thee knowst- and I was much disappointed to   find that I had gone to Germantown a week too soon to see   thee. This to be sure I had but a few hours to stay there,   still I had hoped to spend part of them with thee.- I hope   dear Annie thee is better for thy sojourn at Newport. For I   know the return home without thy father’s welcome must have   been very painful.- even with all the love & kindness of thy   brothers & 
sisters and with the strong consolation thee has of   believing that thy dear parents are forever “where adieus   and farewells are a sound unknown”.- May we realize more &   more the infinite importance of eternal things.- For myself   I seem to glide on day after day occupied with a round of   duties, but in a kind of lethargy in regard to spiritual   things Certainly without that earnest striving which is   commanded & which we may believe is essential to Christian   progress- But confession of our faults avails little without   amendment & I should not burden the with mine. 
We have   parted with our Lizzie to go to Select school. She boards   with John and Sallie Hilles who very kindly offered to take   her- & so far likes her school very much better
than any she ever attended before. I loved that school very   much & whenever I think of it, always see, in my minds eye,-   thee & Julia & Clemmy coming in - &  going to the cloak   room.-
We miss Lizzie exceedingly & I am ready to wonder   how we shall do without her for six months.- She is to come   home after every monthly examination & I long for the time   to arrive.-
Has Clemmy been much with thee lately? I have   scarcely heard of her since her return from Baltimore or of   Julia for a long time- I saw some of George’s pictures   favorably noted in an “art criticism” the other day, at   least I supposed they were his. George B. Wood is his name,   isnt it?
How sad it is that Mary Ann Morris
continued so poorly- tho indeed it is not to be wondered at.   Mary wrote me a few days ago- that she was still much   afflicted with sleeplessness - &  was very nervous. The   former must be most distressing & very [wearing] upon the   constitution.- I hope cousin Eliza will be better for living   in Germantown as the trips out there have done her so much   good. It is to be hoped their walls will not tumble down   before they get moved tho [-----] does not think it would be   son fine &  exciting. – I think their house will be a good   way from you will it not? I am hoping dear Annie to spend a   few days with thee before a very great while- tho I cannot   now see when it will be – probably not for some weeks.- Tho   I do want exceedingly to see thee & as I said before fully   expected to before this. Please write to me when thee feels   like it.- Father  mother have gone out to teaor would said their love- Mine please to thy sister Lizzie &   a large share for thy self from they truly attached   
Susie-

Dear Tom,
Thee must excuse   me for having been so long answering thy letter, & not think   that I did not care about it, for I was right pleased that   thee wrote to me, & I have said to myself ever so many times   [said] that I must write to that “Little “Toms”—  but thee   sees now I have got to be a school mistress, I have so many   cares that I cant always do[o] what I’d like & then I have   had a good many letters to write to different people &   knowing that thee saw the home ones & knew all about me, I   took it the easier.
I have now been “school”mom=’en” long   enough to get a prety good idea of the business – & my idea   of it is, thatits a good deal easier to be a scholar than I teacher, – so   thee can remember that for thy comfort when thee has a hard   lesson to learn.  To teach a school of troublesome boys I   shd. say was one of the hardest businesses’s that cld. well   be got up..  The girls are bad enough, but when it comes to   boys – – they’re the [---] of man.  I have in my school   about 35 boys & a dozen girls between the ages of 6 & 15 —   The girls I have but little trouble with, but the little   boys are regular monkeys.  No sooner is my back turned than   they begin their discussions of wh. they have a variety —    Its the hardest thing in the world to keep them still, & if   they get a good chance there’s not one of them that is too   good to get up & takea dance or a fight or any other such little amusement that   they think will set the school in an uproar.+  [+ Throwing   spit balls is a very bad habit they have – also dancing “Ham   fat”]  My punishments are various.  Sometimes I shake the   culprit & if that wont do, tie em up hand & foot & put em in   the corner — wh. is a very troublesome operation to me.  But   it seems as if nothing wld. beat it into their heads that   school is any thing but a place to play in.  
Most of   them can read a little some not at all, & like “Busy” – they   must always spell girl gril and dirt – drit –.  It seems as   if it came natural —  One of their best accomplishments is   singing wh. we sometimes let them do in school.  My children   know “my”native country thee” & the colored “Wolunteer”— wh.   they shout out with great effect. But I guess I’ve told thee   enough about the darkies  We’ll talk a little abt.the whites.  How comes on work at Haverford?  By the way thy   hand writing is coming on so well, that when I got thy   letter I thot. it was Busy’s himself, it was so good.    Have’nt you a boy named Allen Thomas,?  I expect he’s a nice   fellow & has two very nice brothers whom I met last eveng.    There are [---] pleasant frieds here & I do not often have a   chance to feel lonely or home sick.  How does Prof. Cope &   his botany lectures?  I am going to try to write him a note   to send in this & consequently must say farewell or shall   not have time.  Thee can take this down home with thee next   7th day & tell ‘em it’s all they’ll get this week.— as they   dont deserve any for some time.  Give my love to all, & if   thee gets time write again to thy affec sister C

B 6/7—65—

Dear Mother & sister Annte.

I think   I’ll address you collectively this time, as I suppose   Caroline’s head’ll be turned with weddings & unable to   appreciate common topics. I recd. yr. very interesting &   spirited epistles this morn.g & reply at once, in order that   you may not have cause to complain of remissness this time,   & upon what ground you did it last, I must say I cld. not   discover, as I think I have been up to the mark quite as   much as you have. Thy remarks [a] on properness &c were   quite edifying. I expect thee wd. be charmed with the   Baltimore people. They are certainly most social & charming   in their manners, tho’ I dont believe afterall, when you come to the foundation of things that there is   any more good substantial material among them than among   some of that despised class denominated "the proper." As to   the gentlemen I cant say that I have met any whom I consider   very deeply interesting As far as gallantry & politeness go   they are certainly very attractive Bt if we cld. only   introduce a little more of these elements with some of our   [imperturbables] I incline to think these wld. be found   quite as deep in the long run. I must say it is refreshing   to get hold of some thing that is more [impressible] than a   stone & I intend to [---] up Baltimore ways loudly when I   get home. Tell Cousin Mary she must hurry & come down as   fast as she can, or I fearI shall not get to have my sprees with her. This morn the   new teacher who is going to take my sch. arrived & I was   promoted or depressed I dont know wh. to the rank of   assistant to Mr Waterman, the principal of the sch. It is a   splendid change for me, as his room is much pleasanter & I   have none of the discipline to do but only the hearing of   the lessons—intellectually, it seems a most magnificent   advance frm. a-b only to geography and arithmetic & I shd.   be quite willing to teach there for weeks if it was’nt for   the hot weather, as it is, however, considering the [--] &c   I think I had better not stay much after the three months   are up wh. will be abt. the mid of June--& very soon—as you   will perceive, so you may make preparations for me, soon   after that time—I hope you’ll havepleasant little surprise prepared for me in the way of a   closet—wh. wont be the linen closet—I have to keep up such   an everlasting foolding and unfolding here that I shall be   perfectly delighted to get a place to "hang up" in.

I   expect I am indebted to my frd. Jesse for this release frm.   the infants—I said to him in joke some time ago that I thot,   I shd. give "notice" soon for them to get another teacher &   he took it in earnest but I am very glad, on some accts, as   I shd like to get some ideas about older teaching frm Mr.   W.

I expect you’ll enjoy [Mr. N’s] wedding most as   much as Lilly’s—There was a young gentleman here the other   day who told somebody that he thot L’s wedding was   dreadfully stupid, & that he thot’ one or two of the   bridesmaids (he did’nt say all) were the ugliest girls he   had ever seen—not a very complimentary speech I think.
As I shall probably come home so soon it will not be worth   while to send the things by express—tho’ if I cld only have   had them now they wld. have been exceedingly useful -- I   think maybe I’ll try & get myself a beige skt. here & we   shall not be likely to have many more tea parties now the   warm weather has come -- We’ve never heard any more abt.   Jessies strawberry party & we’re afraid he’s forgotten it.   He took us to a small one out at his bro. James’ night   before last. We went in a buggy & pair & came home by   moonlight—quite romantically -- The buggy is only used on   very romantic occasions, I believe. Its so nice here   moonlight nights—the ladies all dress up in their whites &   sit out on the front door steps, & go round [seeing?] one   another with beaux or beau less just as it happens.Has Fanny Drinker gone home? I reckon she has & where is   Cous. Sarah? Give my love to her if she is about still. I   ought to have written to her. Give my love also to all the   Wynndowners also please give my love & congratulations to   all the bride cousins & tell them I’m very sorry not to be   giving them anything-- Maybe if I aint so lazy I’ll make em   something after I get home. But dont tell em that. I believe   this is all I have to say at present—will write and fix the   day of course before I come. If Cous. M. comes soon please   send the shawl and the [b----] skt. as I [---] much love to   all—yrs. affec

2nd day eve
190 Calvert st

Dear Mother & sisters,   Tired as I am I must write you a few words to night, as I   shall probably be at the sch, in the morn & the mail closes   at 1 P.M. & I thought you’d like to know that we arrived   safely about 5 this aft. & I am installed in my new boarding   house wh. promises to be very nice.  They ladies were   exceedingly kind & welcomed me as if I had been an old   friend  They are so free & easy.  One of them Miss Talbot   came right up in my room & talked to me while I was getting   dressed – & was as kind as possible  They used to know uncle   Jasper & quantities of our friends, so that I begin to feel   quite at home already  It is a large 4story house with a very nice pleasant parlor, & a   comfortable dining room, where we had tea on a little   refreshment table—the 4 school “marms”—as cozy as possible.    They say “thee” & call me by name wh. makes me feel much   less strange
Jesse called a few minutes after we arrived   in his elegant carriage, having been to one of the dipots to   meet us, but we unfortunately had got out at the wrong one;   & very much out of our way.  The ladies seem in very   moderate circumstances only keeping one servant, & a sch. of   near 40 day scholars.   consequently they have not much time   to attend to housekeeping nor much talent in that way I shd.   think.  Their kindness however makes amends.The house is on a very high situation & there is a fine view   of the city fr[m]. my room, wh is in the 2nd story & very   airy & pleasant.  But there is no closet unfortunatley wh.   is remarkably home like & seems to be my fate.  Not a place   to hang a dress, but I have 5 beaureau drawers & can make   out.  So much for the house.  3rd day morn.  We went last   evening to see the sch. & I was most agreeably disappointed   in it in every respect..  The rooms are well ventilated &   airy & no disagreeable odour.  & their state of advancement   is surprising.  There were a few to be sure who reminded me   of Busy—in his attempt to spell girl—but mostly they were   astonishingly quick--& cld. add & subtract like quite   accomplished arithmeticaians.  Quite as fast as I cld.   myself.  They were mostly adults.  In the morningThey are children.
I am to have a class of 30 & am very   glad to find that I shall be in the school with Miss Field,   who is a very pleasant young lady about my own age I shd.   judge, & we can go backwards & forward to gether, & shall be   companionable I hope.  The morning session is frm. 9 till 1   1/2 not 3.  The evening teaching you can take part in or not   as you choose.  So it will not be very laborous & in every   respect, it is going to be I think, much pleasanter than I   had anticipated.  & if you are only satisfied I think I can   be very comfortable & enjoy the work & the change.Love to Cousin Sarah.

Dear Sister–
I   recieved thy note (for I cannot call it a letter because it   contained so much nonsense) yester-day morning; but I did   not say poo! because I had an idea it was from Rachel or at   least hoped it did not contain nonsense.  I was glad to   recieve such information as thy note contained, & thought it   was a great compliment to be called handsome by sombody,   although I do not think father was much complimented by   having his hair called an iron gray color; unfortunatly I   did not lose my heart with her, although I think I must have   seen her & was very sorry I could not go to meting but my   knee was not equal to it.  I could have found some time to   write to you or thee butI have been very lazy since I have been here.  I delivered   thy message to Father (about Dr Thomas) but fear he has   forgotten about it, so I will remind him of it & now I must   close for I am getting lazy & will tell thee what we are   doing when there is some thing to tell about of more   consequence.  I believe Mother intends writing a   P.S.

I am sorry there should be any   mistake about Dr. Thomas  I thought I told you, you would   have to send him word when you were ready to begin  You had   better tell him of myabsence from home so that he may understand why he was not   called on before.  So much for that - the burden of my   [----] is “painting.”  It is the burden on my mind & must of   course show itself in words.  Uncle Tom sent me word that he   had expressed a sample of color which Craig has prepared for   our inspection.  I suppose we may get the package tomorrow –   but what troubles me is the delay – Craig said he would have   it all done so we could come back the 20th.  If he has got   to put on two coats after he hears from us I fear he will   not be ready for us.  We are getting tired of this plan &   anxious to know whether there will be any difficulty about   getting intoour house on the 22nd.

Perhaps if Craig can not get all done & dry he can have the   kitchen & back passages finished & if the last coat is on   the parlors &c we might come in before it is dry–  I feel   sorry to have filled up Toms sheet with nothing but such a   message – try to do better next time.

Locust Shade. 3. 15. 1865

My dear Annie

Does   thee think I have quite forgotten thee and all thy kindness,   & my delightful visit to you? That I have been such a long   while without writing to thee. Indeed I have not, & never   shall I hope- but my wonderings [early] terminated last 7th   day & since then I have had a very bad cold, which thee   knows makes one lazy. - I have wanted to know how thee   faired after our parting on the hill. My walk was brisk & I   did not keep Maggie’s [---] waiting long, and did not feel   tired. I fear thee did not fare so well. Our visit to our   Wilmington friends was very pleasant.
Richie, thee knows, joined me in that. Tho he was not well   enough to enjoy it thoroughly. Lizzie seems very happy & we   hope is learning something, - at least she gets very good   numbers. - The roads were so bad it was not easy to get   about & my journey to Faulkland was a [arduous] one. but the   pleasure of cheering cousin Mary a little & hearing Dr   [Fell]  talk,- a great deal more than repaid me for it.-   

When I returned to Phila John & Sallie Hilles & I   went over to see Charles Rhoads. It was very touching to see   those five little motherless children. Charles looks tens   years older and much broken down.- His sister was very   pleasant- I never knew her before. They are certainly much   favored in having such kind caretakers & hardly feel their   loss as they will after awhile. - I often think of   what

thee said to me in the car after our visit to Clemmy. dear   Annie, with loving sympathy. Deserving too that I may fully   appreciate the blessing of a mothers love while mine is   still spared to me. - I hear Clemmy is going, or has gone to   Baltimore, to teach the Freedmen. What do you think of it?   It seems to me that anything that would give interesting   employment to both mind and body, would be good for her. Tho   I’m right sorry to have her go so far away. - Thee will miss   her too. - Do write some & tell me all about her plans. -   Lilly Collins seems to like her situation very well. I found   a letter from her awaiting me on my return.- She gives an   amusing account of a colored meeting which she attended, - a   real happy [----------] affair.- Lilly enjoys the variety I   should think & it keeps her from being homesick.- Cousin   Elizalooked & seemed more cheerful when I called - but she   certainly is very weak.-

I suppose the preparations   for the wedding are proceeding briskly- Does the go? I quite   want to hear about it. - Lizzie Brown’s sister is to be   married tomorrow & I hope the threatened storm will not come   to spoil all their nice dresses.- Lizzie’s friend Edward   Balderson stayed with us last night. He is to wait on a   young lady from Jersey -  so I fear the love affair between   him & Lizzie is all over - but time will make manifest. Has   thee seen anything more of the interesting students- Till   thy brother Thomas his opinion of the [-----] position of   Carpenters is very family impressed upon my mind.- It makes   me smile now to think how frightened I was, I deserved   rebuke too.- Do please write to me soon dear Annie.- My love   please to thy father & sister E & with a large share of the   same for thyself I am thy sincerely attached & grateful   friend

Dear Ed, Got thy cousin Thomas letter [for] 6th days mail - Suppose the credit of it is due to him not to thee - Therefore thee will not have looked towards getting an answer That was rather an awkward sort of a business wh. Joseph & Jonathan enlisted in where they undertook the Italian Opera I guess Joseph thought it did not operate very well- & he must have felt decidedly the most awkward of the actors. Well, for you was it, that the charge this time happened to be false. For I greatly fear me that some of you, at some other times, have not been overly scrupulous about such transgressions. - So for this consideration let us try & be lenient to the poor Professor remembering that poor human nature is apt to err. & if you are only innocent it will not trouble you much.
Wish regard to my coming down! (every body has to "come down" She knows & as you all seem to be trying to brings me down, I shall not wonder at finding myself fallen in among you some of these days. If they dont get well before Geo.gets ready to start - I shall think it incumbent upon me to go with him. (I do want them to keep very sick on my acct only a very little will be enough) for me to come on, as I have been on the look out for some excuse this Great while. (Don't for pity's sake think that's earnest.) I was sorry enough to hear how really sick poor Harry had been & I feel right anxious to know how he is. If thee hears from them wont thee let us know. It will be sad if they shd all get the measles together as Julia anticipates.
I wrote to thee so lately that I do not seem to have much on my mind just at present. "The storm's rose & the winds blew (blew) might be said of our weather. If I do go down with Geo. I will endeavor to get out to see thee. If I do I've got no time to spend writing to thee that's another thing so adieu adieu [jusqu an remain]". Find out what what means in the French Dic. Thee can tell cousin Thos. I seem to be humble & willing to come down. But this world's a region of certainty - Write at an early period & remember thy ever affec   Sister

Thee will reccollect my dear Brother that when I last saw thee I promised to write to thee in a short time.  Thee will conclude that my short time is a pretty long one but I have been pretty constantly employed since I returned and have not felt in a very letter-writing humour.  I wrote to Caroline about 3 weeks ago and have not yet received an answer I hope thee will prove a better correspondent than she or I shall have but little encouragement to write.  I have begun tolearn french and I like it very much as far as I have gone.  Sister Rachel told me when I was at [Home] that Hannah Bolton had returned from Weston I should be obliged if thee would give my love to her when thee sees her.  Thee desired to know what I was studying.  I am studying, Geography, Grammar, history and spelling and at present how to write a letter worth reading.  Tell sister Rachel I should be pleased to receive a letter from her though I am not willing to risk writing just again but if she will write to me I will endeavour to be more punctual in the answering of her's than I have been of thine.
When thee writes please to tell me how mother is for I believe all ourfamily have forgotten me and therefore I need not look for a letter from any of them.  Tell Alfred I will answer his letter as soon as I possibly can.  mean-while he must wait patiently.  I must now stop for the present as school is just going to close.
Thee desires to know how the swelling is behind my ear I believe it is much the same as it was when I left home.
Please to give my love to Father, Mother, Grandmother, Rachel, William, Caroline & Alfred and accept a large share for thyself & little Mary From thy affectate sister

   My dear Lily,
   
   I expect Caroline will give me "Jesse" as the saying is, if I presume to enter on the stage with her.  Nevertheless as she has occupied the floor for some weeks past in thy favor, I think I shall dare to add a note, tho' she tells me it must be short & upon no account much upon Revenna.  Wherefore conclude she has been expending herself on that ancient & delightful city- & forbear.  Thy letter of-- containing the childrens photographs came tohand two days since, & gave much pleasure.  We think thine, with little Eleanor, is the best of thee we have ever seen, & as to the little E I shd. say she was her Mama in miniature just as little F is his Papa over again only with a few shades more of jollity in his face.  What a sweet little good natur’d  happy kissable face it is & tho' I believe we have understood that he was'nt particularly fond of the latter operation, I doubtnot he has to undergo a good deal of it, & he does'nt look as if he wd. be very refractory under any circumstances, Indeed such a nice little jolly face must be a great comfort to look at, &, I need not suggest for Mamas to be proud of.  I suppose when we get home thee & Alexis will be a grand old couple, sitting up in the middle of your flock, looking very wise & experienced, as you contemplate with "majestic pride" the youthful scions growing & flourishing about you.
   
   I don’t see that thee has a very care worn air however in thy photo-graph.  but on the contrary one might suppose that they cares & worries of domestic life were quite [---] & pleasant.  by what you say I shd. think the heat must have been of that nature wh. wd. have a tendancy to drive you to seek for a cooler clime.  For my part I dont see the use of undertaking to live in such a climate at all, as the chief object of life seems to be with most people to get away from it.  Why not try to live, as I said to the Awbury people yesterday, where such fearful agonies wd. not have contin-ually to be gone thro' with in order to try to effect an escape.
   
   I am very sorry for Madjy's disappointment as her letter to us showed that he hopes were very much set on Europe, & she seems to need some change so much.  It is a great pity they have to undergo such alternations of hope & despair, because they have got [---] on the living side of the Atlantic.  At least it seems to be the side wh. is very much below par with most persons who inhabit it judging from the frantic manner in wh.they rush for the other shore.  The papers say that pretty much Ole America is now on the way to [---].  We concluded that the pleasure to be derived from seeing the play, wh. I think wd. be but doubtful at best, wd. be very much spoiled by the crowd of cooks & other tourists who will infest the country. We therefore have chosen to spend some time insteadin Geneva in French family No 2.  Not that we were disappointed with our experiences in No 1, but that we fell very much in love with this family last fall, when we took some lessons of them.  They are more cultivated people than the others- consequently moreinteresting, & tho' less well off- they are still friench, wh. means that they are practical & know how to be comfortable on a little.  We only pay about half as much as we do at the large Hotels, with more real comfort, beside the very good advantage of hearing the best of french spoken.  The lady has two sons, one a professor in the University & one a clergyman, & two dhrs. all highly educated.  The advantages of the education here for those in moderate circumastances are so very great.  We shall stay probably a month or more until the weather gets to hot wh. does'nt seem very likely- as we are on pretty high ground just outside the city with plenty of green trees & alps in profusion in the distance.
     
   My advice to you is to come & build a cottage on one of the hill sides of Geneva, instead of Woodbourne & get a Savoyard maid as we have, who with her mistresses aid does the work for a household of 9 persons.  We have two dinners daily, of several courses & very well cooked, & how in the world they do it all I cannot conceive.  I suspect that Madam is at the bottom of a good deal, but she does it all with such apparent grace & ease, that one cannot suspect her of cooking.  There are beautiful building lots to be bought here, by the way, on the high ground along the town with the Lake on one side & Mt. Blanc on the other, & there are many beautiful gardens & suburban residences- wh. are quite unseen & [---] by the mere passing traveller.  If it was’nt for those children of yours whom we want to see!- I shd. be quite tempted to invest in one of these little spots & settle down for the rest of my days.  Will thee please ask Alexis to inquire of cousin FRC if he rec'd a letter fm. me posted June 8. containing a cheque for $200.  I also posted one on the 13 June to M.S.C. containing cheque for $100.  As there is some risk of these things being lost shd. be very much obliged if A or some body wd. advertise Provident Life & Trust Company of [---] and [---]. of these two cheques payable to the order of the above mention’d persons.  Hoping soon to have news of you in a cooler clime & under Mrs. Hotchkiss' hospitable roof.  Ever thy affec- sister C.  Ever so many kisses to dear little Agnes & to theothers as for as appreciated by them.

   Dear Uncle,
   
   As I suppose that thee has by this time returned from Sykens' Valley, I will endeavour this morning, to fulfil my promise.  I wish that I could find something to say that would interest thee but I am afraid that in a place like this a person is much better able to hear than to relate news.

I expect that in thy promised letter thee will give a very interesting account of the journey.  I must not forget to mention that we expect to have a French teacher here next week.  He is a Frenchman and has lately come from Ireland where he had been living since his banishment and where his wife now is.  He was a captain under Buonaparte and showed us a number of wounds which he received in the battle ofLeipsic with lances, and several places where bullets had gone entirely through his arms.  When the Pope was taken prisoner by Buonaparte he was guard over him and he treated the Pope so kindly that when he was liberated he made him captain of the Guards of Honor.  He appears to be a very pleasing and goodn-natured man and like all the French, extremely polite.  We expect that he will tell us many very interesting accounts of the battles that he has been present at.  He appears to be a very intelligent man and speaks Arabic, Spanish, Italian and English very fluently.  He accompanied his father who was minister to the Count of Persia and while there acquired a knowledge of the Arabic language.  His name his D'Mouillon.  I do not know whether I have spelt it right or not, but that is the way that it is pronounced.

   As I suppose that thee has by this time returned from Sykens' Valley, I will endeavour this morning, to fulfil my promise.

   Dear Mother,
    
    I had intended to write as soon as it was determined in what class we were to be placed. We are in a class Preparatory to the third session and which will join the third junior at the commencement of the fall session. We like the school very well so far but I suppose that we have not had time to give it a fair trial. I mentioned that a boy by the name of Caleb Needles was with Offleg Sharpless in town I was mistaken in the boy: it was not him. The boys seem to regret Samuel Hilles' leaving them and seem to miss him very much. Please to get us Morocco Portfolios to keep our papers in nearly all the boys have them. Please to get us one yard of figures baire to cover our desks with there is some which is very pretty at Townsend Sharpless: Please send out Franky's Surveying, Mathematical Instruments, History of [Chart] and my Latin Grammar and History of Chart a couple of boxes of blacking, two cups to be used when we wash our teeth and some quills. Saml Linch had a meeting yesterday, afternoon at the meeting house. We received father's letter and are glad to hear you well we are well. We get very good meals except the coffee which is miserable. I am they affectionate.

   Dear Uncle,
   
   As I have but little to do to day why should I not be punctual in answering thy very interesting letter? Perhaps my desire to answer thy letter is not a little increased by what thee says in the latter past of it, that I am indebted to a white-wash woman for it. I have puzzled myself a great deal about how that could  be and at last have come to the conclusion that the said wash-woman is white-washing Grandfathers house, and thee had on that account been obliged to go down to the store, where having nothing to do in the business may, has very kindly taken it into they head to answer my last, especially as the seems to have anticipated a something from the letter that was lying on the desk. However I hope they next will solve the mystery.
    
   As to Monsieur, I told thee all that I knew about what had happened to give us a bad opinion of him, I merely heard that he had moved to be something of an imposter. If he is an Imposter for I can hardly believe that he is, he must be capable of acting the part of the hypocrite extremely well.Thee says that thee cannot accept my excuse for not writing a long letter and that I did not squeeze the right way; whether I squeezed the right way or not, I cannot tell, but when there is nothing to come, nothing will come. As thee had been please to liken the case to milking a cow, suppose I do the same. If the cow has had nothing to eat (in other words if nothing has happened for one to tell about) squeeze might [mong] or stand still as the woman Grandmother Drinker told about did nothing can come: such is my case. Perhaps thee will say "why did not tell thee about those things that thee mentioned last: With respect to the first I have already told thee all I knew about. Monsieur which to be sure is precious little, and with respect to Wm Dennis Address it cost but a trifle, not worth mentioning. Look there! Haven't I argufied  my case right well; at any rate, if I haven't made out any good reasons, I have made it help fill my sheet. Don't thee think that I have made out as good an excuse as thee did for not answering mine sooner.
   
   Thee will please excuse my using the offensive phrase "do not understand": I would not wish thee to understand by that, that they letters are unintelligible to me; they are not by any means. The personages I alluded to thee says are a distinguished inhabitant of the renowned city of Moodle doosie and his faithful and only friend Tom, who by the way thee says is apig. Quite a Compliment! The boys of the 3rd Class (of which there are about a dozen) have just returned from an excursion they have been making this afternoon to the Inclined Plane with Daniel B Smith to obtain minerals. According to their account of the matter they had a delightful time after having obtained the objects for which they went, they went in swimming in the Schuylkill , and found the water very warm, notwithstanding it has been such a cold morning. They were at one time within a mile of the city, and I think had I been with them, that the temptation to run in to the city and say "how-dye-do" to all the folks at home would have been almost sufficient to have induced me to do so, if I could have stayed but a half an hour. Now won't thee acknowledge that I have written a pretty long letter, considering what a poor hand I am? I shall expect a sheet well filled with interesting matter (a thine usually are) to arrive very shortly folded up and dissected to me. I hope top thee mill acknowledge that I have been very punctual in answering thy last. Time slips away very fast and very pleasantly with me. Why does thee not come out and pay us a visit some day.

Philada. 9th mo. 14th 1852
   
   Dear Clemmy,
   
   Grandfather this morning told me he wished me to write to thee for him and invite thee to come down and spend the winter with him, and he sends thee the enclosed notes to pay thy passage.  So thee sees he takes it for granted that thee will come, and when we consider how lonely as he says himself he will be it seems so desirable to all the family that he should have thee with him that we trust Uncle William and Aunt Susan will be willing to spare thee again.  I need not tell thee how glad we shall be to have thee among us, though we do not forget that it will make a break in your family circle.  Grandfather spent yesterday in town (which is the day I began this letter & was interrupted and it is the 15th now) and went out to Uncle Edward’s in the afternoon to stay about a week: from there he will go to pay a visit at Uncle Nathaniel's: he does not expect to return to Uncle Alfred's.  He has been generally much better than he was in the spring & more cheerful.Elizabeth and Anne received thy "double almond" letter as it might be called inasmuch as there were two very good kernels in a shell and as I see that they have torn them apart and Elizabeth has her half in her keeping, I have no doubt she intends to consider it a whole letter and send thee a whole answer which shall not be a postscript to some one else's.  I do not recollect any thing new or strange to tell thee and I will not undertake to entertain thee with the particulars of Harry's advances in talking & Franky's in gymnastics which are uppermost in our thoughts and might come out first if I would let them.  Julia returned from Reading a few days ago having spent a couple of weeks there after her grandfather's death, and we are all together again and jogging along as usual.  Mary & Carry Yarnall spent a few days with us lately.  Aunt Mary is at Chester and I do not suppose she will return home much before Grandfather.
   
   This is a very pleasant task Grandfather has put upon me.  I was not surprised at his sending for thee for I thought from remarks he had made several times during the summer that it was very likely he would do so, and now that the time for his return home draws near we are old and young united in thinking it very desirable, for it would not do for him to have no one living with him but Aunt Mary, it would be lonely for both & if she was unwell at any time he would have no one with him.  Send us word in time when andhow thee will come down.  thy blanket shawl we will send up if we can find a conveyance early enough, unless thee tells us that thee does not want it.  Being in town next winter will give thee an opportunity of continuing some of thy studies though the sciences of baking and nursing and general housekeeping may be neglected for a while.  Anne and Julia expect to continue French at School- whether they will go on with the other studies or part of them is undetermined but not very likely, but we hope they will find some way of making good use of their time.
   
   Our three families send their love & hope soon to have thee [am]ong us.  Julia says she will write in a few days.  Ann[e is] spending the evening with Laura.  Hoping soon [---] from thee and soon after to see thee, I am affectionately

   I suppose Father has told you that I arrived here safe and therefore it is needless for me to say anything in that respect.  I found it was harder to part with Father than I expected:  I felt the difference between being with my connections and Master Lewis' family; however I have got pretty well used to their noise and have got once more settled down to my studies pretty much in the old way.  I am sorry to have it to tell you that the cloth I got while I was at home is damaged.  there is a very ugly place goes round the sleeve of the coat and there are a few spots in other parts of the cloth.  I dare say this will be very disagreeable news, and I am sorry for it but can not help it.
   
   I did not find Alice as I hoped to find her, down stairs, nor is she able to come down now.
    
   I would tell thee nothing to tell Grandmother but I shall give her the pleasure or I hope I shallof informing her myself.  perhaps thee may wonder what I mean by saying, I hope I shall; I dont mean that I hope I shall write to her but I hope it will give her pleasure if I do write.
   
   I have read Think-I-to-myself since I cam back and I think it is a very interesting tale; but I suppose thee would much rather hear that I had read the Bible and so I have read some of it.  perhaps thee will say to thyself, I wonder how much; why I can tell thee 3 verses at least.  perhaps thee may now say to thyself, very little indeed; but hower if used rightly it might be better than none.  I have not heard from Caroline since I left her at West-town but she seemed to leave us quite contentedly, an indication I think (though I dont pretend to know much about it) of a strong mind.  I can easily see a difference between me and her in that respect, (but it is best to be sensible of our faults Jacob Lindley tells us) for I am pretty sure that I felt more dejected when Father left me than Caroline did when Father left her.I would like to hear how Father & Alfred got home but I suppose if any of their legs or arms or any of their bones at all had been broken I should have heard of it.
   
   The preceeding lines have been written several days ago and I was waiting for a favorable opportunity to send them which I now have by Charles Allen.  one of my hands is again affected by poison.
   
   The spots on my coat have in a great measure disappeared.

Woodbourne 7mo. 29th 1830
   Dear Brother:
   
   The idea presented in thine of ye 20 inst. of finding me out in the woods, I may truly say, excited in me very pleasant feelings; tho' at ye same time, I feel as if I can scarcely dare to invite you, for reasons that I think it wd. not be proper to mention in a letter. I will give thee a remote exception of what amongst other things, I allude to, by refering to a frequent remark, that in every flock, there is a black sheep, & a Judas in every community. more than this, I ought not to say. I believe I have never hesitated to answer any query put to me by relatives & friends respecting my situation, nor have I any objections to doing so, unless I may have a very particular reason for secrecy. but Marmaduke will perhaps from having been an impartial spectator, be more likely to give thee a satisfactory description of Woodbourne than myself.- E. Walker bro't me thy letter whilst I was spending ye evening as usual, with his family. I mentioned what was said by thee about visiting me. George desired me to tell thee that they shd. be very glad to see thee: and Priscilla said, tell him to bring Rachel &Martha. they all seemed to be as glad to see Marmaduke & our other cousins, as if they had been their own relations. it seemed to me to be quite like an era in ye history of Woodbourne, when my City relations had actually paid me a visit.- I think you had better come on, and take us by surprise as they did, and thus give us no time to think about any obstructions, objections, or difficulties. with regard to any pecuniary considerations, I think I cd. fully satisfy my neighbours, tho' they will not listen to any direct proposition relative to consideration money.- in expressing what precedes, I have used ye freedom, which ought to exist in ye intercourse between brothers. to one, who does not stand in ye same relationship to me as thyself, I wd. have felt some hesitation in saying what I have said to thee.- I was much interested in reading thy description of ye proposed institution for imparting instruction in ye higher branches of learning to the children of Friends, and had no idea that so great an advance had been made towards affecting ye object in view. it is a noble undertaking, & if accomplished, will tend to increase ye reputation of the Society. the sup-position or opinion, that our profession, principles or religion acquires ye discouragement of literary knowledge & intelligence, appears to me pretty evidently to be a mistake.-  I was fearful that there wd. be an appearance of ambiguity in my observations with regard to the Union Canal stock.  In my last communication on ye subject, I expressed a willingness to invest, if I cd. obtain five per cent on the am't invested.  this I shd. receive, were I to give $240 per share, or 120 per cent.  consequently, if I am right in my estimate, ye price is still below my limits.  but of course, there would be no advantage in offering a high price, if there is none of the stock for sale.-  I am much obliged to thy attention to the subject.  supposing that the Bank of Penna has declared ye dame divd. for ye last as for ye previous half year, I inclose a Power of Att'y for its collection, & one also for the interest on the C & D Canal loan.  if the Lehigh Co. shd. have disclosed a divd. please inform me.  I see by the news-papers, that 3 1/2% has been declared by the U.S. B'k.
   
   With best love to family & friends, I remain thy affectionate brother,

   I now take up my pen to write to thee my much esteemed Friend William D Cope. whose letters of the 15th, 21th (of June), and the 1th of July have received. by that of the 15th thee has informed me of a sorrowful circumstance respecting thy dear cosin, a circumstance which by thee and many others I judge will not be soon forgotten. And altho thee and has been so kind as to inform me of some very important circumstances respecting the affares of the Country, yet I believe thee will not think strange of me if I say but little or nothing on that ssubject, as what little news I get is unly such as thee has heard thyself, for it is principally from the Westchester paper which is extracted from the papers of the City. I was at Ennoch Lewis's about three weeks ago and I think the boys are nether better contented there than they were last winter, for the rules are somewhat milder, they are now allowed to go to bed when they please. And as for going out of bounds I believe there is but little attention payd to  it, that I think Friend William, (altho I was so tired of it last winter) I could spend a few months more there very well. I believe about two thirds of the boys are such as ware there when I was and of think thy all appeared to be in good health.John Taylor was at our house a few days ago and informed me that he had lately received a letter from John Elliott, which stated that his brother that went into the Army was shot at the time of the battle at Far York. I understood he was not in the battle at the time he was shot, but was out some distance from the Army with a few others and ware met by about fourty Indian's, who immediately fired at them and killed nine. I understood Johns Brother rode about a mile on Horseback after he had received three shots. One in his arm and two in his body, He was then taken off his Horse. But expireed in a few minutes after one of our neighbour's had his barn burned a few days ago by the lightening and his crop was all burned in it which was to him a considerable loss as he was not in very affluent circumstances. I think Friend Cope if thy double letter had miscarried and been broken open by any person he or she would of seen something in it worth a laughing at. I mean the part respecting thy beard. I understand thee is so tormented with thy huge beard that thee has been studying what thee should get that would kill it. But as thee is not likely to get anything that will answer the purpose, thee has requested thyFriend to take up a resolution and to good for evil (that is for pulling his whiskers) by contriving something that will answer the 8th purpose. but of should not think it a friendly act to destroy that which nature has formed as an ornament for my Friend.

   My Dear Carrie-
   I hope the expression of sympathy & affection may be acceptable, even though there may be no new thoughts of comfort to suggest.
   
   I was so sorry to hear from Sister Lillie today that Edgar's health had been poor. I though of him as a strong man. It will be a pleasure, no doubt, though mingled with sadness, to Nettie & thee, to minister to the comfort of your remaining brother.
   
   The memory of Alexis is one of calmness & sweetness. I did not know him well, yet recall with pleasure the queit cordiality of his greeting. Samuel Morris, who rode in the same carriagewith me at the funeral, said he had learned to love him much. I think it is grateful to look back on his life here as a happy one, & his life there as is fit & glorious consummation. And he left a dear legacy in his children. I am glad you have them. I count myself so rich in my dear nephews & nieces, my young brothers & sisters, as I sometimes call them. Does thee know I am a great-aunt? My oldest nephew, Joseph Rhoads, has a wee Edgar, away out in Plainfield Indiana, where he has gone to teach. Hetty  is out there, helping. Has been away nearly 7 weeks & we don't know when we shall get her back. She went to help furnish & arrange the new little home.
   
   Fanny & Alfred Garret were here last evening a while. We do think Fannya very lively have character, & Alfred seems to be coming out a fine manly boy, & doing well at college. 
    
   How the time does fleet away! Think of it being 50 years since we were at West-town together! And what can those fleeting years show? For me, a life made up of many little things, & with too many idle hours. I enjoy my work of various kinds though; simple household cares, an extensive correspondence, partly for pleasant sympathies, partly for teaching, & on the rest days, a restful work in the care of my first-day class. Dr. Rhoads holds a school at our house and I have as my class nearly 20 boys & girls from 9 to 14 years old who troop up to my room with me. I will not claim to do them much good. I don't believe in direct religious teaching exceptwhere there is an opening for it, but I think the hour passes not unprofitably, & they learn to find the study of the Bible pleasant.    
   I hope Ellie Alderson may continue to improve. I should be glad to hear from thee if thee can feel like writing, & to be told what your prospects are.
   With Love to Nettie & Thyself,
   ever thy affectionate friend

   My Dear Cousin,
   
   I enclose herewith copy of minutes adopted at the last meeting of the Board of Managers of Haverford College and which I was directed to send to thee.
   
   I cannot tell thee how I missed cousin Jonathan at this meeting. He wasone of those I always counted on for sympathy and enouragement.
   
   Sincerely thine,
   CJ RhoadsI hereby certify that the following is a true and correct copy from the minutes of action taken at a meeting of the Board of Managers of THE CORPORATION OF HAVERFORD COLLEGE held 5th Month 19th, 1911.
   
   The President reminded the Board that since our last meeting two of our fellow Managers had had been taken from us by death, and it was unanimously resolved that the following minutes be entered on our records.
   
    On 3rd Month 26th, 1911, Jonathan Evans passed away in his 67th year. He was elected a Manager of this Corporation on 10th Month 12th, 1897, and continued in active service until his death. We shall always remember his as one who loved his fellow men, which trait endeared him to those with whom he came in contact. For many years he took a lively interest in all the out-door activites at the College and by frequent visits to the campus kept himself informed of the condition and needs of the grounds and buildings. On this account his judment on question that came before us was the more valuable because it was based on personal knowledge. He was personally known to many of the students, who were often helped by his affectionate sympathy with all their interests. His fellow Managers will truly miss his presence at their meetings, at which he was a faithful and regular attendant.***********

   Here we are safe and sound on board the old craft and out of sight of land already at 7.30 a.m.  I am writing this to go by the pilot as he has not left us yet. The main reason for our being out of sight of land is that the fog is ratherthick.  I didn't turn out very early and am just as glad that I didn't as there wasn't much to be seen I guess, coming down the harbor. Ed didn't either, though he had thought of it last night.  Our roommates are named Argill and O'Brien. The latter appears to be a self-made Irishman, but rather good company I guess. Argill I have not seen yet in his civilized clothes. He is not what youwould call a sleeping beauty. George says he has a very nice man in his room.    A Mr Tucker. 
   
   Class Day and commencement went off very well and we had very good weather a very seemtial point. Uncle Will made nice address. 
   
    Please thank Anna very much for her steamer letter. It was very good of her to write. Please give my love and Aunty Lily and Ellie. Ed sends love to them and to both Ann & thyself in which I join. 
   
    Lovingly thy son, 
   Ernest
   
   June 17. 1905
   P.S. I forgot to thank thee for thy steamer letter too, dear.

Dear Mother
   It certainly does not seem over two weeks ago that I saw you at Aldine, and I can scarcely tell what I have been doing with myself.  The Sophomore-Freshman debate caame off the Third-day of the week after I saw you, and so I was pretty busy preparing for that.  Unfortunately we lost.  It was the first thing the Freshmen had beaten us in, so we were rather sour.  Then the next night came the Entertainment for the Preston Boys' Club.  I had no idea of staying till the dance but go to talking and didn't get back till after twelve!  It was very good fun and I enjoyed it very much.  It is rather good fun to watch other people dance even though you don't dance yourself.  It was a success financially too, and we cleared $156.25 all of which, I am glad to say was given to the Boys' Club through Dr. Babbitt.  For a wonder the newspaper report about Emily Fox and the Biddles was true except that I think it was greatly exaggerated.  Detectives have been put on the case, I believe and they hope to recover at least some of the things.  I don't know whether they think they lost it or that it was stolen.  It certainly was mighty hard luck as I believe some of Emily's things were valuable on account of being heir looms. 
   
   Ernest's knee, I think is just about all right.  He can walk around on it all right but I imagine it is still weak. 
   
   The weather here has been quite warm and the snow has been melting pretty fast, but there is a good deal of ice over things and it takes a good while to melt that off.  To-day however is quite cool again, though I imagine it will warm up toward the middle of the day as the sun has so much power.  It sounds fine to hear of May days and violets and daffodils but it will not be so very long before we too shall be getting spring, for here it is about a third of  the way through March.  It certainly seems funny to think that there are only three more weeks of the third quarter left; for the fourth quarter goes by like grease-lightening.  I am glad I am not in Ernest's shoes. 
   
   To-night the gymnasium competition with Lehigh University comes off and I certainly hope we win.  Last week our team went up to Rutgers, and when the last event began we were several points behind, but we won the event and the meet by one point!  I hope it will be as exciting to-night. 
   
   It is fine to hear of all that Anna can do.  Please give her a great deal of love from me and tell her that this letter is for her too.  I suppose thee has heard of President Sharpless' illness.  He has not been at college for nearly three weeks, I think.  They took him into the Pennsylvania Hospital where Fred Sharpless  is one of the physicians, but he is better now. 
   
   Last Fourth day afternoon we had another festivity in the way of a Faculty tea for the Sophomores.  It was rather good fun, though I don't think much of teas.  They are too stiff and formal. 
   
   I think I shall have to cry a halt as my slender stock of news is about exhausted.  With lots of love for you both and thanking thee very much for thy letter, 
   
   Thy very affectionate son   Harold.

Title: 1875 November 28, Church Lane, to brother

Church Lane 11 mo 28. 75
   
   My dear brother
   
   Having received a message from thee through a letter to Tom, and not being able to plead sickness as a reason for not writing, I am going to send thee a greeting-  Well we are not going to see thee until next spring, it seems a long time, and we were all of us not a little disappointed when the news came.  We were counting the days until the time when thee was to sail and beginning to speculate upon the probable length of the passage, when suddenly all our hopes were dashed-  I was going to say I would not flatter thee by telling thee what lamentations there were on the part of some of us, but I think it does no one harm to know how much they are loved and missed at home, on the contrary I think  to a young man it does good, tending perhaps to keep him out of some things by which he might otherwise be tempted-  Now for the scrape of news I can glean up-  Last fourth day Tom and I drove over to Haverford to bring away thy [chattels?]-  We arranged to go on third day, but on that day we had a regular old fashioned Nor'easter and it poured most of the day-  The next morning about nine oclock Tommy appeared at our house in the [---] with Lady and Eric (Harry having been laid up some time with sore feet) after getting some more warm wraps for it had cleared off quite cold when we started-  The roads were in a pretty miserable state of muddiness and as we undertook to go by the Lancaster road we almost stuck so to speak-  However we reached the College about half past eleven, and finding the students in recitation we went up stairs and explored-  We found all thy things had been moved out of thy room and were locked up in another closet of which the matron hadkey so she had to be hunted up-  We packed most of the books and some other things in a drawer which Tommy and I carried down to the front door Tommy saying it was "like carrying down a little coffin"-  We donated to Frank Haines a bottle of eye wash, a little bottle of carbolic acid and a few other valuables?-  Thus were the last rites performed-  We packed the books in the bottom of the wagon, and put the precious articles, around with we supposed tender associations ( clung , (a broken fan with names thereon &c) between folds of the down cover-  We drove home to dinner reaching Awbury about quarter of four-  We had a good laugh at Tom - one of the objects over was to bring home the hanging book shelf and we forgot all about it, and came home without it - which rankled in Tommy's breast-  By the way talking of Haverford does thee know they have raised a sufficient amount of money to enable them to build, and Samuel Alsop Jr told me it was decided to go ahead-  The day we werethere was the day before Thanksgiving day, and as I waited upstairs in the entry while Tom was hunting up the Matron I was amused at two of the students, one was in the hall down stairs and as the other came out I suppose from recitation - he announced the fact that they were going to have Turkey for dinner, whereupon there went up such a howl of rejoicing as almost upset me-  We hoped while at Haverford to have had time to have called upon Margaret Yarnall, but we spent to much time at Any Marys that we had not time.  I suppose you have heard that Ellis and M Yarnall are boarding at [---] during the Winter.  I am glad to hear they are vert comfortably fixed-  It seems an out of the way kind of place for them, a good deal away from most of the latter's friends, I should think she would long to have her daughter with her.  I do feel for them very much-  First day 12/5.  A week, my dear Afred, has passed since I commenced this letter yet it is not finished.5
   During the week we have been pained from day to day to hear of Uncle Alfred's increasing illness.  As early as the beginning of the week Dr Wister said he seemed to be failing, and on second day they telegraphed for James, they received an answer the next morning only saying "will come" and that is all they have heard.  Up to second day Uncle Alfred has been able to get over into the library, this he has accomplished with the aid of a man who has been staying with him at night for a number of weeks- assisting him to dress and undress.  One second day he was so much weaker that he had to remain in bed- and since then he has been gradually growing weaker and weaker, until yesterday afternoon about three o'clock he quietly passed away-  He does not seem to have had any acute disease-  His appetite almost entirely gave out, and he gradually weakened - with the exception of a pain in one of his lungs I do not think he has suffered any-  Since last first day Uncle Tom and John E Carter have been sitting up with him half of alternate nights, the nurse sitting up the other half.  Lilly and Edward have been staying over at Fairfield for the last day or two-  Yesterday morning having heard how he was the evening before Father, Uncle Tom and Aunt Lizzie went over there, the Doctor came soon after they arrived and said he did not think he could live but a few minutes.  They went up into his room (except Father who had gone on to town) and sat there for two hours awaiting the close- he seemed entirely conscious but lay perfectly still excepting once when he passed his hand through his hair as his custom was and once he put his hand under his head-  They went to dinner and a few minutes after dinner was over he passed away, no one but Aunt Rebecca, Lily and Edward being present.  Just at the close, there was a short spasm and then to him all was joy and peace and rest-  What a wonderful and glorious change it must be for him after a long life of ill health and suffering during which I suppose he could never have said he really felt well, to awake inthat Holy City none of whose inhabitants can say I sick and where "there shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, neither shall there be ay more pain: for the former things are passed away"-  Aunt Caroline seems to feel it very much, not having seen for some time except a few days ago, when hearing how sick he was she went out to see him, but ut was thought best for her not to go in the room or let him see her so she looked at him through the door-  The only remarks I have heard that Uncle Alfred made (though he probably said more which I have not heard) were that some days ago he told J.E.C. "that it made very little difference which way it ended" meaning his sickness-  To E. Allen who visited home within a few days, and as she was leaving said she supposed she should never see him on earth again and that she did not doubt but that the change would be a glorious one to him he replied "I have been forced to feel very quiet and peaceful"  I think those were the words he used-  The funeral is to be next third day at two oclock.  It will be a great trial I doubt not to James to find all over when hearrives - 
   
   Last sixth day Uncle Tom commenced his winter readings and it was said to have been a very interesting occasion-  Neither Chellie nor I was able to get there-  There is a good deal of stir in our City now over the meetings of Moody & Sankey-  They have fitted up the old freight depot of the Pennsylvania RR so that it will seat about eleven thousand and meetings are being held I think twice on week days and three times on first days - they are largely attended and from accounts some of them must be impressive.  I hope they may do good-
   
   I suppose Mother in her weekly letter told you that Hazen had sprained his ancle, turned it under him as he was rushing out of the side door to catch the train-  Tommy seems to think it was a mercy he sprained it as it will probably save him from something worse if he will only take warning.  He had to hold it up for nearly a week.  However he is about again now tho he says it feels weak.  Aunt Lizzie Brown is still down at Atlantic City where she has been for some 9
   weeks and from accounts does not seem much better.  Aunt Fanny went down last third day taking with her a maid to stay with aunt Lizzie-  I am afraid her sickness is a pretty serious one and not to be gotten over in a hurry.  The rest of them at Grandfathers are pretty well now-  Grandfather has had a cold but is better-  Aunt Martha Leeds I suppose you have heard is at the Frankford Asylum, and from last accounts was not much better in her mind and was also very sick with [---] in her head-  I dont know whether thee has heard or not that the new building at Haverford is to go up next year they having got enough subscribed to warrant them in commencing so Samuel Alsop Jr told me.
   
   Lillies letter from [---] arrived on sixth day last and we were very glad to hear of your being so comfortably and pleasantly fixed-  Please give a great deal of love to both Lilly and Alexis and tell them I often think of them both with much affection and truly it does seem a long long time since we parted with them.  I do hope the stay will do you all a great deal of good-  I am afraid you have missed some of our letters Chell and I both misunderstood and have been directing our letters to Brown-Shipley & Co Liverpool - and I am afraid they have not forwarded them-  I wrote not long ago a letter to thee and one to Lilly and Alexis enclosing a photograph of the baby to each-  If they have never come to hand I will send you another-  Harry has at last made up his mind to return to Minneapolis - he expects to start next fourth day.  I hope he will have a more prosperous time the coming year than he has had the last-  Upon looking over the forepart of this letter which I wrote a week ago I find I have mentioned about the building at Haverford in that so thee will please excuse my telling it again-  I dont feel like rewriting the letter-  Chell sends her love to you all in which I join and wish you "a merry Christmas" and "a happy New Year"-  I remain thy
   loving brother

My dear Lilly.  I know   that thee has thought it strange that I have never written   to thee all summer. but one thing and another always turned   up. & [---] the days go by without doing so – now that I   really have something to tell thee perhaps it won’t be so   hard! but I wont go on like Elliston Morris – but will get   to the point of my tale which is simply that I am engaged to   Will Lewis!  The engagement is not to be announced for a   long time yet –  This is especiallyimportant on Will Lewis’ account and I am sure thee will   help us to keep it quiet and be very careful not to let the   children or anyone else suspect the truth!  It does seem   strange that I should be engaged to one whom neither thee or   Chellie know – but I Sincerely hope you will soon know him   and learn to like him as one of the family!  My happiness is   so complete that I can scarcely realize all that has   happened –  that what I have prayed and longed for for so   many months has actually come to pass and I am engaged to   him whom I have loved for so long a time – it has all been   Sosudden! the Change – that I feel as if I was in a dream &   cannot realize the truth!  Our own immediate families are   the only ones who are to know anything about it for the   present – so please be very careful not to mention the   subject –  I really think it would be better to talk about   it as little as possible – for "little pitchers have big   ears" thee knows! of course thee won’t have anyone to talk   to about it now.  but I meant especially when J and R. go up   & after you all got home.
The mail is about to go –& news is scarce at present – so I wont continue scrawling.   
With love – I am thine 
very   affectionately
Carrie.

B 6/7—65—

Dear Mother & sister Annte.

I think   I’ll address you collectively this time, as I suppose   Caroline’s head’ll be turned with weddings & unable to   appreciate common topics. I recd. yr. very interesting &   spirited epistles this morn.g & reply at once, in order that   you may not have cause to complain of remissness this time,   & upon what ground you did it last, I must say I cld. not   discover, as I think I have been up to the mark quite as   much as you have. Thy remarks [a] on properness &c were   quite edifying. I expect thee wd. be charmed with the   Baltimore people. They are certainly most social & charming   in their manners, tho’ I dont believe afterall, when you come to the foundation of things that there is   any more good substantial material among them than among   some of that despised class denominated "the proper." As to   the gentlemen I cant say that I have met any whom I consider   very deeply interesting As far as gallantry & politeness go   they are certainly very attractive Bt if we cld. only   introduce a little more of these elements with some of our   [imperturbables] I incline to think these wld. be found   quite as deep in the long run. I must say it is refreshing   to get hold of some thing that is more [impressible] than a   stone & I intend to [---] up Baltimore ways loudly when I   get home. Tell Cousin Mary she must hurry & come down as   fast as she can, or I fearI shall not get to have my sprees with her. This morn the   new teacher who is going to take my sch. arrived & I was   promoted or depressed I dont know wh. to the rank of   assistant to Mr Waterman, the principal of the sch. It is a   splendid change for me, as his room is much pleasanter & I   have none of the discipline to do but only the hearing of   the lessons—intellectually, it seems a most magnificent   advance frm. a-b only to geography and arithmetic & I shd.   be quite willing to teach there for weeks if it was’nt for   the hot weather, as it is, however, considering the [--] &c   I think I had better not stay much after the three months   are up wh. will be abt. the mid of June--& very soon—as you   will perceive, so you may make preparations for me, soon   after that time—I hope you’ll havepleasant little surprise prepared for me in the way of a   closet—wh. wont be the linen closet—I have to keep up such   an everlasting foolding and unfolding here that I shall be   perfectly delighted to get a place to "hang up" in.

I   expect I am indebted to my frd. Jesse for this release frm.   the infants—I said to him in joke some time ago that I thot,   I shd. give "notice" soon for them to get another teacher &   he took it in earnest but I am very glad, on some accts, as   I shd like to get some ideas about older teaching frm Mr.   W.

I expect you’ll enjoy [Mr. N’s] wedding most as   much as Lilly’s—There was a young gentleman here the other   day who told somebody that he thot L’s wedding was   dreadfully stupid, & that he thot’ one or two of the   bridesmaids (he did’nt say all) were the ugliest girls he   had ever seen—not a very complimentary speech I think.
As I shall probably come home so soon it will not be worth   while to send the things by express—tho’ if I cld only have   had them now they wld. have been exceedingly useful -- I   think maybe I’ll try & get myself a beige skt. here & we   shall not be likely to have many more tea parties now the   warm weather has come -- We’ve never heard any more abt.   Jessies strawberry party & we’re afraid he’s forgotten it.   He took us to a small one out at his bro. James’ night   before last. We went in a buggy & pair & came home by   moonlight—quite romantically -- The buggy is only used on   very romantic occasions, I believe. Its so nice here   moonlight nights—the ladies all dress up in their whites &   sit out on the front door steps, & go round [seeing?] one   another with beaux or beau less just as it happens.Has Fanny Drinker gone home? I reckon she has & where is   Cous. Sarah? Give my love to her if she is about still. I   ought to have written to her. Give my love also to all the   Wynndowners also please give my love & congratulations to   all the bride cousins & tell them I’m very sorry not to be   giving them anything-- Maybe if I aint so lazy I’ll make em   something after I get home. But dont tell em that. I believe   this is all I have to say at present—will write and fix the   day of course before I come. If Cous. M. comes soon please   send the shawl and the [b----] skt. as I [---] much love to   all—yrs. affec

   "I long have thought my absent friends, a something to have sent you,
   Tho' it should serve nae other ends, than just a kind memento."
   
   Thy letter bearing date of twenty seventh of last month- came to hand after some detention- and has determined me to set about writing immediately- as I owe it, both to my duty, and my feelings, to send a speedy reply to thy communication- containing intelligence of a nature- which astonished & vexed me not a little.  I was astonished, thee should suppose me to be the author of that document, styled by thee, the "witty letter;" and vexed, that any one should descend to such meanness- as thus to endeavour to practice upon thy credulity.  As for me, I must disclaim all knowledge or connection with it in any way- and I do not envy the person who could be guilty of such an action- any of the wit it displayed- or grammatical learning- which if I understood thee rightly it is woefully deficient in.
   
   By the bye, I am much indebted for the compliment, of having so fine a piece of wit and learning, attributed as the production of my hand and pen- at the same time I will frankly own- from some expressions in thy letter- I think the shadow of a doubt more than [---] crossed thy mind as to my being in reality, the author.
   
   And now the question is- who can have been the offenders and against whom are we to direct our honest indignation? for I assure thee I feel no small share- I have not the slightest idea who it can be and yet some one it wd. seem, who had some knowledge of the circumstances- must have had a hand in it.  I think the want of learning displayed- could only have been a part of their plan to avoid detection- and not from real ignorance of the rules of grammar.  I've a womans curiosity to see the letter, and know all about it.
whether the writing resembles mine- if 'twas dated B........ with my name appended to it; all of which enquired I hope to have answered.
   
   The says in thy letter- ro please the ladies- thee must not broach serious subjects- if thee wishes to please my ladyship- and thee has professed as much- thee may make choice of any subject- whether "sober prose, or prose run mad"- I shall not object to anything and 'tis quite a mistaken idea- that ladies are never pleased with serious subjects- notwithstanding the author of the witty letter to the contrary.- Although thee may think there is very little like sobriety, or a disposition to moralize, in my character- I think my heart can duly appreciate and respond to good sentiments, whenever it is my good fortune to meet with them.
   
   Have we not had a very delightful Autumn?  such beautiful weather for riding or walking- and yet we have not availed ourselves of the bright sunshineand pleasant air- to make any rambling excursions in the woods or along by the banks of the river- the scattered foliage is already strewn upon the pathway- and in a few short days- we shall have the bare and leafless branches- telling us of the desolation of natures beauties.  Spring has always been my favorite season- but in all its gaiety and animation- it could not spread a scene more showy or more varied than the one now before us- such a happy blending of colours- but we have no beautiful hills or fertile [---]- where nature at this season appears so prominently beautiful.  In the "far off country" which thee inhabits- there must be every variety and beauty of scene- but then the distance is such a barrier- so many hundred miles from all ones friends-  I almost wonder thee has not been tempted to move within the reach of those thee holds most dear---
   
   I am sorry thee has experienced any uneasiness onaccount of having read to me those New York letters;- since it is so- I regret thee favourd me with a sight- at the same time I feel very certain of not having betrayed the confidence reposed in me- and have not the most distant idea who the lady can be.  I think the young lady- with so many [trunks?] – must have played the coquette very skillfuly- to have secured so many offers in so short a time- she knew her power I suppose- and was determined to excersize it- at the expense of her numerous admirers- Before I close my letter I must not forget to acknowledge the receipt of two newspapers- sometime in the month of August- for which accept my thanks the tale which they contained (the title of it I forget just now) I quite admired.--  The other day I met with something which pleased me exceedingly, in one of [Lardners?] papers.- It was an essay on lovers- and described the different kinds of lovers, most admirably- I recognized more than one or two, or three of my acquaintance in the descriptions.  I wd. like them to see it.-  I must now conclude my letter- as I have already written more- than I expected to- or that can afford thee much interest in the perusal.  with [---] of    rememberance-
   I remain sincerely thy friend,
   S.....
   
   Thy letters have all been duly received- Pray admire the beautiful direction- especially the D.10 Mo. 24 at Montrose

I am giving thee dear William- a proof of my sincere and unabated affection- in this early replying to thy most welcome letter of the 8th which only came to hand this morning- thee may be sure its arrival was awaited by me, with more than usual impatience- I could not believe another week wd. be suffered to elapse- without the accustomed message of love, and rememberence,- and every day I wd. say to myself well- I certainly will hear to day- but very many times have I been doomed to suffer disappointment- how however- I am relieved by the actual presence of the well known hand writing- and will thus evince my greatful feelings- in its early acknowledgement.-  Let me tell thee dear William- I think thee greatly undervalues thy epistolary talents, thy letters cannot be any thing but interesting to me- and if I acknowledge them to be so- why that,- must be as much as thee can desire- as for my own I have long since despaired of arriving at any thing like excellence in the art,- and the only and slight merit- if merit it may called- which they posess- is the spirit of affection which they [---], & which prompts me to the undertaking I have not the least partiality for the employment thee knows- and often with merely for the purpose of receiving in return.-  To day I was [---] gratified & delighted- for independent of the pleasure thine afforded me- there was one from my dear sister Caroline.  I will not tell thee what she says, now- but when thee comes- thee shall see it.- I do not know that I recollect to observation thee alludes to- as having been made by me- when last here- at least I am not certain what it was.- The will find in me as usual- a very ready and willing listener to all thee may have to communicate- I hope my presence will not prove talismanic and cause thee to forget what thee had to say- I did not find it necessary to apply to Father for information respecting the time of holding our monthly meeting- it has just passed, last week- and the next oneoccurs- on the ninth of April- The [---] is- the first fourth day after the first second day in the month.- I had a sweet little note from cousin Edith the other day- it contained an invitiation for us to come, or rather go out to make them a visit- I knew it wd. not be very pleasant just now and in my answer, declined the invitation for myself- and promised to deliver the one to thee when next we met- Edith styles thee, her "cousin elect" already.-  What an appalling spectacle the burning of the Wm Penn must have been- It will have an effect I think, to increase the fears of [---] travellers-.  How sorrowful I felt, upon learning of the death- of R.B. [Thornson?], during her life we had each of us, made attempts to become better acquainted- but were never very successful- and now in her death, I feel as if I had almost lost a dear friend- her family will feel her loss to be irreparable- I should like to have some particulars of her death- I trust it was a happy one- holding out consolation to her afflicted and berieved family-.  Dearest Wm. I must now say farewell! as it is fast-approaching [---] 6 o'clock- and I am encroaching not a little [---] the time usually devoted to the indifference of my friends [---]- with a thousand assurances of undiminished affection

Thy letter of 25 inst. I have just rece'd & feel a deep sense of gratitude for thy kindness in answering my last to thee. I had made arrangements for my departure for Woodbourne early tomorrow morning, but I shall postpone my return thither in order to see thee tomorrow. I should come immediately, were it not my plans require some change. I should have left this vicinity with much regret, without having had another interview with thee, and I cannot now think of doing so, without trying to do everything in my power to remove unpleasant feelings, and substitute those of a better kind in their place. I shall make thee a full & renewed avowal of my sentiments & feelings to and in regard to thee, and shall acknowledge my past errors. for such indeed they would seem to be, when viewed in the abstract. I must confess, tho' perhaps the acknowledgement will not serve as an extenuation, that as remarked by thee, I am inexperienced with regard to that part of human nature, comprehended in the female character. I shall repose entire confidence in the safety with which I may communicate with thee, and will thee not Dear Susan do the same in regard to me? let us consider that the heart of each is to be a sacred secure depository of the thoughts & feelings of the other. do, Susan, let me see thee look cheerful. it wounds me deeply to see thee otherwise. May we realize the truth of the last but not the first lines of the following stanza:The greatest joys those seldom prove,   Who free from quarres live.   O! tis the sweetest part of love,   Each other to forgive
   
   Let us cast the veil of oblivion over everything that has taken place of an unpleasant nature between us & begin anew, or rather continue as it were our acquaintance from its most auspicious & happy one.- Believe me, to be faithful & true and as heretofore, thy attached,

   My very dear wife, 
   
   I am writing at home before meeting so as to take the letter with us to meeting and mail it. This is a very cool morning the thermo at 6.40 standing at 56° and although it has grown considerably warmer since yet it is still quite cool. Oh! my dear how I wish I could see you I do love you so. I feel quite anxious to hear how you are but suppose I shall hear nothing now until I see Tom--I had indulged a vain hope that somehow I might spend the fourth with you but there is so much to do at the office that I could not leave just at that time but I am hoping I can get off so as to come on the latter part of the week, but don't count on it too certainly but I will if I anyhow can. They want me to spend the fourth down in Maryland and I think I shall although it will hardly pay as I shall not be able to go down until the 5 o'clock train third day evening or early fifth day morning. I enclose a letter I received from Kate this morning it came enclosed in one to Madgie. I do hope you are getting along comfortably and are all well--give my love to the family. I paid John's wife the $25 yesterday. Thee can tell him that they were all well.Mother had a postal yesterday from aunt E. Brown she is still at the [Rigi?] something and expects to stay there all summer she seemed in good spirits. I am ashamed to say that I have not been over to call upon the Newhalls yet but from reports they are very much pleased with the place. There mother seems stronger and sleeps better. I am afraid dearest my letters are very stupid- writing every day there is not much chance for a collection of news but then thee knows each one contains any quantity of love and sympathy and dearestI feel that we are growing nearer and dearer to each other all the time and it is such a comfort. Margaret is still at Awbury but expects to go home tomorrow-morning. The carriage has just come up so I must bring this to a sudden pull up.
   
   With dear love to the children and lots for thyself I am dearest they loving husband

Awbury –
April 2.nd.

Dearest Lilly –
I don’t   know what thee has thought of me for not thanking thee   before for thy Most generous Contribution to our Collection   for the Colored Summer Home –  it came on the day of the   evening when Jonnie was stricken. & I forgot about it   entirely until the following Tuesday, the day of our   Collection, & I should have sat downright then & written. but Anna was writing to thee & I sent   a message. & thought I would wait until I had more time to   write a longer letter.  but that time has scarce seemed to   come until now!  We have just finished dining at Mother’s –   & while Mother is engaged in her usual occupation with the   dishes in the pantry. I had sat down in the library with Tom   & Will who are both reading. to write to thee.  Anna was so   long ingetting her letter off to thee.  I imagine the Contents told   everything up to within a day or two –  Chellie is very   wonderful,– perfectly calm & like herself –  but she looks   badly – & I fear as the days go on & she realizes more &   more what has happened. that she will show it even more –   but she is blessed with four devoted Sons who are looking   after her in every way –  Miss Richardson of Course, as thee   knows is with them – & they kept theNurse, whom they had for Jonnie, until yesterday.  Anna too   keeps well. & so far is entirely natural – but Miss   Richardson watches her like a hawk. & never lets her be   alone long – they want her to go away.– but she does not   want to.– & Miss R. told me yesterday that they would not   insist upon it – which I am glad of – for I think we cannot   always judge what is best for others at these   times.
Mother, I am thankfulto say, is very well – & with Anna & my being here   alternately she has gotten along very well with the new maid   whom Anna got for her – but of course she is not a Companion   – or a trained nurse – and I think we are going to be able   to get Susan Stewart out next week for a few weeks until she   (Susan) goes to the Hospital –  We may be able to keep her   until Mother goes to North East, but thatI Cannot say –  Chellie was in hopes that Mother would   [heed] this nurse who has been with her this week.  & if she   liked her to have her go to Northeast with her.  but Mother   was strongly opposed to it –  I think largely because she   was a stranger – now we had proposed Miss Moses’ name.  &   she wants her –  So I expect she will be gotten –  I had had   a talk with her. & she is entirely willing to undertake it   if she is wanted. & both Mother & Tomseem to want it – tho’ Tom says he wants nothing except what   Mother wants –  The trouble is about Miss Moses she will   have to [leave] Mother to be home by the first of October –    I am quite sure she will be a very devoted nurse – and I   think it will be very hard for Mother to let her go –  I   only wish we could get a permanency –  Before Jonnie died   Miss R. had told Mother that she would come back to her in   the fall. & I think Mother ishoping for that –  but I feel that is not to be counted   upon.
Please forgive such a lenghty epistle –  Mother has   now returned from the pantry – the men have departed & I   must say goodbye to thee –
Please give my love to Ellie &   much for thyself –
from thy loving sister

Dear father
I rec’d   thy letter 5th day morning.  Thy accounts quite make me wish   to see England some time although I dont know that that time   will ever come.  On 4th day we sailed round Canonicut, and   since Lilly says she has given thee a condensed account of   our trip, I will copy our log by way of variety.  The   officers were: Capt. Geo. F Merritt, 1st mate T.P. Cope Jr   2nd mate A Cope Jr; Seaman T.K. Longstreth, Cabin boy F.H.   Cope.  Steward M. C Collins.  Cook V. Hartshorne and 6   passengers, A Newhall, M Newhall, M Farnum, H Carter, M.   Collins, & E.S. Cope.
Log of the Canonicut Party – Yacht   “TCope [Deferred]”
(Rations limited)
Started from the   pier at 8 1/2, A.M., arrived at the lighthouse at 8.40.   there met M.C. Cope and party in a row boat, who wished us   joy,and desired us to report all new discoveries; soon after we   commenced telling fortunes.  2 m. of 9 o’clock saw a   porpoise on the starboard side.  9.22. off fort Adams,   weather, calm, thin canopy of clouds, at this moment it was   proposed to “put more steam on.”  Three persons forward of   the “Lobster Box.”  progress, “slow but awfully sure.”  10.   o’clock, interesting information concerning the compass, by   Capt. Merritt.  surf seen at Bever Tail, fears entertained   for the health of the party.  Some excitement caused by the   appearance of two fish, which produced restlessness on the   part of the cabin boy –  10.11. opposite the Dumplings.  11   o’clock opposite Castle Hill the game of quintettes played   with interest by the 1st mate, cook, and several of the   passengers; the steward seiged with headache – at this time   doubts were expressed by the captain as to the probability   of the winds changing before 6 P.M. weather still calm.  [8]   m after 11. met a sailing vessel commanded by captain Henry   Merritt, rowed by the capt. and sculled by Henry Merritt jr   who hailed us, and threw a small lobster into the boat one   of the passengers was badly bitten which caused great   excitement untill she was rescued from the jaws of the   carnivorous creature.  11 1/2 A.M. Slight windthe South and visible, stood off to welcome it.  Party   regaled themselves with rations. 12. M. South wind   continues.  candy handed.  Met a schooner and were saluted   by a dog on board.  Long swells, health good.  12.10.   conversation on the weather prohibited– a number of the   passengers retired to rest – Cabin boy reclining on a   passenger–  cook on the dinner basket–  1st mate absorbed in   a book.  12.45. Point Judith lighthouse in sight.  After   serious consideration it was decided to pursue our journey   on which account three cheers were given.  12.50. Passing   Bever Tail.  three more cheers – passengers happy – saluted   by the horn and a towel was waved to us, which compliment   was returned passengers waving handkerchiefs.  2. P.M.   Dinner – great dispute on the subject of ringing the   triangle.  2.45. from “Lobster Box” end–  dinner   accomplished satisfactorily leaving the voyagers in a   quiescent state of mind–  dinner consisted of 9 courses   closed with sour-drops–  opposite M. Williams’- Bay   comparatively speaking very rough!  Fast passing Wickford –   Slight excitement Fortunes being told again aft. The 1st   mate has just restored the cabin to order, after dinner.    Aft becoming very impudent.  Bow hair dressing.  1st matesweeping and thereby discomboberating all – 2.55. Patience   in sight.  sentiment in the bow, 3.12. Approaching the end   of Canonicut Greenwich off the larboard bow.  Patience and   Rocky Pt. ahead.  the breeze delightful, and all of the   party very comfortable, some reading, some working zephyr   work.  3.20. Rounding the north end of Canonicut.  Three   cheers given by all the party.  3.35. P.M. Rounding   Canonicut.  Newport in view – on our homeward trip – breeze   good.  some of the party wishing to land we are going to (we   did’nt) 3.38. Met the Providence steamboat- Needless anxiety   on the part of the passengers.  Now dashing gaily towards   Newport.  3.55 Proceeding fondly – just played games of   authors and consequences.  3 m. of 5.P.M. off the   Lighthouse. health good.  Fine breeze- Band tuning up for a   song before we reach the pier.  Arrived at the pier at   5.P.M.  On first day evening we took a walk to Tammany Hill.   we started after a 6 o’clock tea but were not able to get   there untill dark or dusk.  It is the first time I was ever   there.  We saw the lights at Point Judith, the Light Ship,   Bever Tail and the Break water.  Yesterday was splendidlyclear.  In the morning we took a short float, I cant call it   a sail there wasn’t any wind, after which we went bathing.    In the afternoon I made up a small sailing party consisting   of Alice Carter, Abby Newhall, Tom Longstreth and Alfred, we   went out to the Dumplings and landed, & afterwards came back   to take Caroline Mary her first sail.  She could’nt have had   a more pleasant evening it neither too cold nor too warm, &   there was a splendid breeze.  We went around Rose Island and   got back in good season.  though not strictly obeying her   mothers instructions about being home at half past 6.  This   morning we went bathing as usual and also engaged the boat,   Alfred preferring to go to Coddingtons Cove to bathing.    Thee will observe that I’ve been getting about as much good   out of boating as possible this season.  Since we arrived   Alf has become a staunch friend of Geo. Merritt’s and Hazen   of Geo. Barlow’s. Its quite remarkable how devoted Alf is,   he spends the big parts of his time at the reading room with   George.  This morning I got a new key fitted, formy valise, having lost the other since my arrival.  We were   not able to mail these letters in time to go by the [La---]   so they will have to take their chance by going via New   York.  There are 24 folks going to Philadelphia the night we   go, which will make a pretty effectual change in Mary   Williams’ boarders, and there will be no one left but Tom   Longstreth to do the honors of the occasion.  We are rather   puzzled as to what to do if we were left by the 7 o’clock   train from New York, since the 10 o’clock train has been   taken off the line.  We will have to run the risk, I   suppose, of getting the 8.40, Washington train, stopped at   Frankford.  Having run out of news and since mother is also   writing I will stop.
affecty thy son

Title: 1831 August 1, Philadelphia, to Sister

Philada 8th. mo 1st. 1831

I dare say, my dear sister,   thee has felt inclined since we parted, sometimes, to apply   to me the old adage with regard to promising people vis.   that, 
“A ready maker
Is a ready breaker:”
since   the offer to write to thee was entirely voluntary on my   part, and yet I have suffered two weeks, nearly, to pass   without making an effort to fulfil my engagement.- As usual,   I am rich in excuses--the most prominent of which, is the   impossibility I found in obtaining a certain direction to my   letter; and either imagining the epistle, when completed,   would be too valuable to be thrown away, or else deeming, (I   did not stop to analyze feelings), my time too precious to   be expended upon that which would profit my correspondant   nothing, I concluded to defer writing altogether, until   Henry came up to this, our quarterly   solemnity.---

And now, having got thro’ the most   important and generally most stupid part of epistolary   communications, vis. the preface, let me dash at once into   my stock of news, and  cull for thy benefit such pieces of   information as will be likely to interest thee. I greatly   fear the selection will be a small one, for summer is a   particularly unsocial season, unless it is with our most   intimate friends and of course, we hear but little of what   is passing in
the world without.- I suppose thee will say it is respecting   the movements of friends thee would wish to be informed; and   if they would only do something, in the least degree, and of   the common line, I should take great pleasure in   transmitting an account of it to thee; but they are all   pursuing their usual routine of occupations, enjoying   themselves in a most provoking state of quiescence, and   doing and saying nothing that would give use to any   comments.----- Maryann tarried about two weeks at [Calcon]-   Hook, and she says passed her time very pleasantly,   notwithstanding the ungracious sounds, issuing from young   master Frank’s mouth, which occasionally saluted her   maidenly ears.-- I believe she could say, very pathetically,   “I am never merry when I hear such music,” she thinks, I   imagine, that we need never apprehend consumption in the   case of our little nephew, adopting, as I opine she does,   Anna Braithwaites favorite maxim that all our faculties,   bodily as well as mental, may be “strengthened by reason of   use”.-- Father, Mother, the aforenamed cousin, and myself,   spent a day with Caroline not long since.-- She seems quite   comfortable and very well; she is fattening on cottage   cheese and “lovely, rich cream.” and fortifying her bodily   powers by riding frequently on horse-back- Her darling son   looks admirably, walks boldly  alone and chatters at a most   rapid rate.* [Note at bottom edge of page: “lest thee should   be led into the mistake of supposing him, even a more   marvellous child than he really he is, I must state that his   conversations are carried on in a language peculiar to   himself, and are quite unintelligible to ordinary   hearers----“] I must do him the justice to say that he   behaved himself very gentlemanly during the whole period of   our visit and struttedabout in his apron of thy purchasing, (with which, by the   bye, he is delighted), with quite the air of a person of   importance---------

We had a considerable collection   of friends at our mansion during the whole time of the   conference—Jeremiah Hubard and his wife, two female friends   from Providence, and cousin A. Barker lodged with us, and   they attracted others during the day—so that we had a real   miniature yearly meeting-- With the consignment from your   house, we were all, I believe, much amused—Oh! if thee had   but been present at the relation of their courtship given by   the husband, and heard the gentle, deprecatory tone in which   the wife endeavored to ward off the narration, & the very   singular intonation of her voice in her exclamations of “oh,   Jeremiah, now dont”!! It was absolutely irresistible!—She   has now gone with “cousin [Nat]” to visit her relations in   Virginia, and her better half has taken refuge from the   intolerable heat of our city, at Joel Woolman’s.—Now this, I   should say was “a bitter change, severer for severe,” for a   more exposed, comfortless-looking country dwelling I have   seldom seen than the residence of this same   milkman.--------

I hope the purchases I have made for   thee will prove satisfactory—the cambric, I procured as   nearly like Henry’s cravat as I could.—Do take notice of the   beautiful picture on the cologne water bottle.- I have often   heard of the angel of health coming with healing in his   --
wings, but the idea of being kicked into “salubrity” (to use   Caleb’s phrase), is quite novel, and from the position in   which the ministering spirit here stands, I should suppose   the virtue lay in his heels—Uncle Jaspar’s family have been   very regularly heard from.—Abbeyann is much better but   Uncle’s eye still continues bad and they fear he will be   obliged to have an operation performed when they reach   Cincinnati.- I saw Martha on sixth day and never saw her   look better--- Mother is somewhat improved—She and Father   have at last fixed upon this week for leaving home.- the   latter part of it I expect.—Mary Stokes is added to the   party---- I have almost filled my sheet and have not said a   word about the fire we had had—It was “horribly beautiful”   but terribly allarming 

Rachel R. Cope
DealI must refer thee to Henry for particulars.---- I am glad to  hear the boys areenjoying themselves-- Give my love to them and tell them not  to be tooventuresome.-- I dislike apologies about letters, but in  looking over this I cannotbut be struck with the triffling nature of its  contents.—However, the weather is too warm to be  intellectual, even supposing I had it in my power, and it is  only on rare occasions that I am sentimental. Such as it is,  I hope thee will deem it worthy an early reply to thy  attached sister

Thomas Kite’s wife is here   spending a day or two and her daughter also.  I suppose thee   has heard of the little boy who has been so ill here he was   taken with the measles and that layed the foundation for the   consumption and after suffering for a long time he was taken   away at three o clock in the morning of the first of spring    we had no school on six or seventh day but we all went to   our school rooms and red our bibles and on seventh day   morning we were taken into see his corpse and he was buried on seventh day afternoon   his name was Nathan Comstock and he was an orphan he lived   in Lockport New York  he has a brother and sister here and   his sister is a lovely girl but I know very little about his   brother.  Benjamin Sharpless was here to thee funeral and he   asked me if I had ever seen him at Tommy Cope’s and I told   him no., but I have often heard of him.

Aunt   Lydia is not at all well she has a very bad cold and a good   deal of pain in that lump on her face and she keep her bed   the greater part of the day but she is rathe better at   present than she has been lately  I think she would of been   better if she had not of gone down to supper last night   through the cold entry.  I have some things to write for and   I do not think I shall have any more time to write to thee.    Cousin L sends her respects to all of you. but I send my   love to all be lieve me as ever thy affectionate   niece

7th mo. 28th. 1867.

Dear Father
Lilly and Chelly having been keeping up such an active correspondence by the last two steamers, I thought I would reserve my efforts untill they had got through. 
We received a letter from uncle Tom inclosing a letter from thee informing us of the loss of thy masticators, it      would have been remarkably unfortunate if thee had not had      an extra set with thee.  I hope by this time thee is      enjoying thyself on terra firma, but since the difference of      time between where thee is and where we are is so great, we      find it hard to guess what thee is about.  We received letters from home last night, dated the 25th., saying they   were all well and preparing to leave for Newport on 5th day.   Mother had also received a letter from thee mailed at   Halifax
On last 6th day we rode to Stony Clove, an   entirely new place to me, about 10 miles distant.  The road   is quite rough, and runs between two mountains, one of which   rises almost perpendicularly about 1000 ft, as near as we   could judge, and on each side there are large rocks under   which we found ice: they say the sun never gets there and   the ice under the rocks never melts during the summer.  On   approaching this place the air becomes perceptably cooler   and on leaving it becomes warm again.  We took dinner at a   little farm house and although it was plain weenjoyed it very much.  After dinner we had to leave right   away for home.  Going back we had a splendid view of those   distant mountains you see on your way to the Plauterkill   Clove.
Yesterday morning we, that is Tom Stokes, Harry,   some other gentlemen and myself, walked down to Bastion   Falls to take a bath, thee remembers what a fine basin there   is at the foot of the falls, well it was there we went in;   the water was pretty cool on first going in but after we had   been in a little while, and had kicked around a good bit we   got quite warm and all in a glow.  We went under the fall   where it hit the rocks for a second time, but even there the   water stung like hail-stones, and I preferredthe pool to getting such a warming as that.  In the      afternoon we walked over to the Mountain House to see the      view, on starting it was beautifully clear but when we had      gone about half way, two clouds, very considerately, came      rolling down upon us, one from North and one from South      mountain, and by the time we got to the precipice both the      view and ourselves were completely mistified; we accordingly      went into the House and got weighed, and since thee will not      object to hearing how much some of the members of thy      immediate family weigh, I will give thee part of the      table:
R.R.C.  125 lbs.   E.S.C.  98 lbs.   T.P.C.  90      lbs.     Rachel has gained 7 lbs. since last sum- mer, and its becoming quite dreadful; I'm afraid, if she      goes on gaining, we will be obliged to have her put up in a      barrel and roll her home from Newport.  Tom Stokes, Ellie,      Madjie, and Walter are going home tomorrow morning: the rest      of us expect to leave here fourth day and go to Albany, we      will stay there that night, and go to Boston the next day;      leaving Boston 6th. day afternoon we will arrive at Newport      in time for tea.  I suppose mother has told thee that she      succeeded in engaging both the Georges during our stay      there.  The weather here has been very warm and showery; to      day it is very pleasant but it has been so very showery we      were afraid to try going to walk. Aunt Lizzie received two letters from the Adirondacks to      day one from cousin Clemmy and one from aunt Annie, giving      an account of a trip which they had taken to lake Placid by      the way of John Brown's grave; aunt Annie said the grave was      very plain, there was a tombstone with some engraving on it      and on a boulder nearby was the plain inscription "John      Brown - 1859."  She also said cousin Clemmy was a good deal      stronger and was able to bear fatigue as well as the rest of      them  They were both very much surprised to hear of thy      sudden leaving for England.  Lilly and Chelly send their      love.  We are all well and have had a most splendid time      considering that our "pa" is on the other side of the Atlantic and now having given thee   all the news I can remember I will   stop.
affectionately
thy son Thos P. Cope Jr

I      promised thy little brother to add a postscript to his      letter, inasmuch as he thought he should be unable to fill      the sheet – but he has left me so much room that I believe I      shall have to call in William’s aid to clothe the preceding      page –  Thos. has been in the parlor for a day or two, in      consequence of a bruise he has received on his eye –  It was      occasioned entirely by an accidental blow from a stick in      the hand of one of his companions, & seem’d at first rather      disposed to be troublesome – but by a faithful application      of lead-water yesterday it is nearly recovered – so nearly      that it occasions no inconvenience, & is but slightly      discoloured –  He seems to think that eye is particularly      unfortunate, as it is the same one which was hurt some time      ago –  I do not think thy mother need feel uneasy about it,      as we shall try to take all necessary care of him, if any      more is needed –  In regard to being careful himself, he      needs some few cautions, tis true – but I will tell it to      his credit, that for an active, adventurous little boy he is      very well disposed to take advice – & when he makes promises      to adopt it, is, I believe, very scrupulous in fulfilling      them.  He has beguiled some of the hours of his confinement      in doors, by reading “Rollo’s vacation” to me – & we have      found it quite entertaining –  I think it arrived just at      the right moment –  So much for Thomas –.  now for Willie –      with whom I am becoming better acquaintedas the ice is now broken – & he frequently pays us a visit      in our parlor –  He tells me – he is more comfortable than      formerly – & that the cause of his unhappiness is re-moved –      what this cause was, I do not know – but he looks so      pleasant & happy that I am inclined to believe he is not      depressed by any great weight of troubles –  They are very      different boys but both have found means to interest me      warmly for them – & I think I shall not soon cease to love      them – Tom is sitting by me begging me to proceed – but the      end of my paper warns me that I may already have tired thee      – therefore will take the hint after desiring my love to thy      mother – and assuring thee of

I      promised thy little brother to add a postscript to his      letter, inasmuch as he thought he should be unable to fill      the sheet – but he has left me so much room that I believe I      shall have to call in William’s aid to clothe the preceding      page –  Thos. has been in the parlor for a day or two, in      consequence of a bruise he has received on his eye –  It was      occasioned entirely by an accidental blow from a stick in      the hand of one of his companions, & seem’d at first rather      disposed to be troublesome – but by a faithful application      of lead-water yesterday it is nearly recovered – so nearly      that it occasions no inconvenience, & is but slightly      discoloured –  He seems to think that eye is particularly      unfortunate, as it is the same one which was hurt some time      ago –  I do not think thy mother need feel uneasy about it,      as we shall try to take all necessary care of him, if any      more is needed –  In regard to being careful himself, he      needs some few cautions, tis true – but I will tell it to      his credit, that for an active, adventurous little boy he is      very well disposed to take advice – & when he makes promises      to adopt it, is, I believe, very scrupulous in fulfilling      them.  He has beguiled some of the hours of his confinement      in doors, by reading “Rollo’s vacation” to me – & we have      found it quite entertaining –  I think it arrived just at      the right moment –  So much for Thomas –.  now for Willie –      with whom I am becoming better acquaintedas the ice is now broken – & he frequently pays us a visit      in our parlor –  He tells me – he is more comfortable than      formerly – & that the cause of his unhappiness is re-moved –      what this cause was, I do not know – but he looks so      pleasant & happy that I am inclined to believe he is not      depressed by any great weight of troubles –  They are very      different boys but both have found means to interest me      warmly for them – & I think I shall not soon cease to love      them – Tom is sitting by me begging me to proceed – but the      end of my paper warns me that I may already have tired thee      – therefore will take the hint after desiring my love to thy      mother – and assuring thee of

I      promised thy little brother to add a postscript to his      letter, inasmuch as he thought he should be unable to fill      the sheet – but he has left me so much room that I believe I      shall have to call in William’s aid to clothe the preceding      page –  Thos. has been in the parlor for a day or two, in      consequence of a bruise he has received on his eye –  It was      occasioned entirely by an accidental blow from a stick in      the hand of one of his companions, & seem’d at first rather      disposed to be troublesome – but by a faithful application      of lead-water yesterday it is nearly recovered – so nearly      that it occasions no inconvenience, & is but slightly      discoloured –  He seems to think that eye is particularly      unfortunate, as it is the same one which was hurt some time      ago –  I do not think thy mother need feel uneasy about it,      as we shall try to take all necessary care of him, if any      more is needed –  In regard to being careful himself, he      needs some few cautions, tis true – but I will tell it to      his credit, that for an active, adventurous little boy he is      very well disposed to take advice – & when he makes promises      to adopt it, is, I believe, very scrupulous in fulfilling      them.  He has beguiled some of the hours of his confinement      in doors, by reading “Rollo’s vacation” to me – & we have      found it quite entertaining –  I think it arrived just at      the right moment –  So much for Thomas –.  now for Willie –      with whom I am becoming better acquaintedas the ice is now broken – & he frequently pays us a visit      in our parlor –  He tells me – he is more comfortable than      formerly – & that the cause of his unhappiness is re-moved –      what this cause was, I do not know – but he looks so      pleasant & happy that I am inclined to believe he is not      depressed by any great weight of troubles –  They are very      different boys but both have found means to interest me      warmly for them – & I think I shall not soon cease to love      them – Tom is sitting by me begging me to proceed – but the      end of my paper warns me that I may already have tired thee      – therefore will take the hint after desiring my love to thy      mother – and assuring thee of

My dear Jonnie,

We have not heard from   the crime paper. Edward, however, I happen to know has a   [--] in it, as Mikell used his paper as a model for the   person he secured to read the other papers. This is not   publicinformation, though there is no reason why Edward should not   know. You ought to be proud of that boy. He has not only   done well -- he has done splendidly, and I understand that   either he or his friend Kratz leads the class with higher   marks than we have given in the first year for several   years. Good brains have helped, - but hard steady work has   been the realfactor. Two things gave me special satisfaction; one that I   did not know his handwriting, and the other that I had   marked him higher than anyone else in my subject, writing   across the face of his paper just after reading it: “a Jim   dum dandy man”. 

Father is a great deal better – up   and about. I have just returned from Narragansett. Weather   perfect here.uppose it is also with you. All send   love.

Affectionately

I handed your   love as directed which was receiv’d pleasure your Cousins   Seem very throng one going to sea the other going in the   Contry [i] beleive will not have time to write, perhaps John   may  If he dont you must be content with this poor scrowl   from your Loveing Grandmother

Rachel Drinker
Dear Cousins,

By the permission of grandmother, I   take this opportunity of indulging myself in writing a few   line to you, which I should have done previous to this and   in a more particular manner, but my time has been pretty   generally occupied; and as my health has not for this some   time past been as good as formerly, I have not given so much   attention to my promise of writing to you as I otherwise   should have done –  The City in general is unusually   healthy, which I hope is not a presage to any malignant   fever: The weather is not at present very favourable after   so much rain, it is too warm–
Arthur I expect will sail   in a few days for St Thomas’s, where he intends selling   vessel and cargo, the sale of the former will depend upon   the price she will bring –  The voyage will be attended with   less danger than the former one to Cape Francois; they will   be liable it is true, to be taken by the English and French,   by the former because the port is a French one, by the   latter because they had been to the Cape; however if they   are careful to avoid all vessels in due time and conceal the   name of the sloop and her having been to Hayti they will   escapebeing captured–  The Sloop sails very fast [and] will in all   probability reach the port without any accident from man;   the fast sailing of the vessel will not quell a storm: then   thay must use their skill, do what lies in their power and   not be dismayed–
One would almost be induced to suppose   that nothing new or strange can take place, that every thing   that is extraordinary has past, and that the mine of wonder   is exhausted, for there is nothing but a series of old   occurrences revolving upon the face of the inhabitable and   navigable world–  Here I must resign my pen, and close this   uninteresting scrawl, with wishing you the blessing of   health and happiness –
I remain your affectionate   cousin

By the permission of grandmother, I   take this opportunity of indulging myself in writing a few   line to you, which I should have done previous to this and   in a more particular manner, but my time has been pretty   generally occupied; and as my health has not for this some   time past been as good as formerly, I have not given so much   attention to my promise of writing to you as I otherwise   should have done –  The City in general is unusually   healthy, which I hope is not a presage to any malignant   fever: The weather is not at present very favourable after   so much rain, it is too warm–
Arthur I expect will sail   in a few days for St Thomas’s, where he intends selling   vessel and cargo, the sale of the former will depend upon   the price she will bring –  The voyage will be attended with   less danger than the former one to Cape Francois; they will   be liable it is true, to be taken by the English and French,   by the former because the port is a French one, by the   latter because they had been to the Cape; however if they   are careful to avoid all vessels in due time and conceal the   name of the sloop and her having been to Hayti they will   escapebeing captured–  The Sloop sails very fast [and] will in all   probability reach the port without any accident from man;   the fast sailing of the vessel will not quell a storm: then   thay must use their skill, do what lies in their power and   not be dismayed–
One would almost be induced to suppose   that nothing new or strange can take place, that every thing   that is extraordinary has past, and that the mine of wonder   is exhausted, for there is nothing but a series of old   occurrences revolving upon the face of the inhabitable and   navigable world–  Here I must resign my pen, and close this   uninteresting scrawl, with wishing you the blessing of   health and happiness –
I remain your affectionate   cousin

8.14. ’05 —

My very dear   friends –
I was very glad to hear again of you,– tho’   sorry to learn of your semi-invalidism,– in which I can   fully sympathise,– but I am overwhelmed – by your generous   check – which was so thoughtful – & so useful! –  I cannot   express myself with sufficient gratitude, & can only say   that it is accepted in the same loving spirit in which it   was sent, & for the inherited friendship of our re-spective parents & grandparents.–
– Did you ever know, or   hear among your family traditions of the strong intimacy   there was between yr. grandfather,– Thomas P. Cope – the   shipping merchant,– & my grandfather – Philip Price the   Superintendent of Westtown School, nearly 100 yrs. ago?–  My   grandfather had a large family of 10 children to educate &   c.– & when his eldest son,– Dr. Wm. Price rec.d his   diploma,– yr. grandfather gave him a double position on one   of his ships going to China,– those of Dr. & also of   supercargo,– & he made 2 trips,– each for 3 yrs,–  It was a   great event in the P. family
I am glad you are having a   pleasant summer in your quiet retreat.–  I am preaching "the   simple life"– more as weknew it in our quiet country homes, or in the simplicity of   Friends.–  I enjoy social life in a quiet way with good   neighbors & a few friends calling in the evenings – but the   constant round of it all day & every day is wearing.
–   What halcyon days we used to have at Woodbourne,– and my   children have no knowledge of it &, only the older ones –   have a bare recollection of dear Cousin Sarah, with none at   all of your lovely Mother.–  What a sunbeam she was!–  I   have some lovely memories to look back upon, but I don’t   seem to acquire in my old age the gentle loveliness of so   many of our old Friends, tho’ I am frequently called upon to   say with a dear old cousin of my Mother’s – Priscilla   Townsend,– (whowas the Mother of the Dentist Elisha K. Townsend who   founded the Philada. Dental College–) "Let me number my   blessings!"–  And another saying of an old Irish neighbor we   had – who had many trials & sorrows – but would end up her   stories with – "but sure, Welcome be the Will of the   Lord!"–
– But I am too reminiscent for young people, &   this letter is terribly egotistic, so I will stop but your   kindness & dear Annette’s letter have brought back many   delightful memories.–  The years are rapidly rolling by, & I   have now entered my eightieth. –
Good bye,– with dear   love to you both & many thanks I remain
your old   friend

Dear Uncles
Thomas & Joshua Pim   /

I wrote to my Bror. John &c the 17th. of last mo:   aqt.ing them of a great alteration in my ffamily, wch.   letter I supose went in a ship just then ready to sail to   Ireland and now I acquaint you that it hath pleased Divine   Providence to remove my wife from me by Death,  She was   taken Ill of (that Dreadfull distemper) the smallpox about   the 4th. of last moth: & departed in the night between the   14th. & 15th. of ye. same being Sorely afflicted wth. the   distemper, but verry sencible all the time & I hope made   good use of sd. time, often praying & praising God, & tho:   in the time of her health she did not seem as fully as I   cou’d a wisht to Joyn wth. ffrds.  (tho she- went to no   other worship that I know off since we came here but   severall times to ffriends meetings) yet in her Illness she   was desirous of the company of sollid ffrds & severall of   such did visit her & I think are generally in good hopes   that she Dyed in Peace & I believe few who knew her here   were streangers to her former circumstance for my part I did   not endeavour to conceall the truth from Honest ffriends,   and before I pesumed to appoint her buriall I requested   leave of ffriends to Bury her in their ground, which was soe   readily granted that they told me they thought it needless   to ask it, phaps you may desire to know wt. I recd of the   debt due to me I cannot say yt. I recd. none tho: (I thought   more was due,) for Just at last, she desired it might be   forgot or forgiven wch. I think implyed some acknowledgment    I think for above a year past she grew the most sollid &   sober yt. I have known her at all – & I cannot but admire   how much her loss is lamented in this neighbourhood, for she   was a verry oblieging neighbour & skillfull in many   things

I mentioned to my Bror. &c [---] [---] of the   Illness of my youngest Child, we thought it was dying the   next day after its mothers death, yet it continued for   fifteen days longer for the most pt. in great extremity &   then Died, wch. long Illness I believe helped to wean me   from it, soe that its Death did not affect me soe much as I   believe it wd. if it had a died soon, for it was a verry   pleasant Child, it was 7 months old when it fell   sick

I mentioned in a former letter to my Brother the   Death of my servant Jo: Gavin who was the first of my   ffamily who was taken Ill, & Died about a week or 6 days   before the next began my ffamily then consisted of 12 psons   (i:e: before this sickness) whereof 7 was to have it, & of   the 7: 3 is dead, wch. we may conclude was a great stroake,   tho: I may tell you that it does not yet seem soe hard for   me to bear as wt. I formerly bore, but the Death of my poor   wife seemd a greater exercise than I expected it wd. a been,   however I still endeavour to be patient & content wth. what   Providence permits to be my lot in this troublsom   world

I am through [meny] greatly favoured wth.   Health & my five Children are now pitty well tho: my Son   Thos. has had a hard time & a narrow escape with his life   thro: the smallpox

I have been verry well furnisht   with good neighbours during this trouble pticularly Thos.   M.cChuns wife (being a nurse) did not see her own house for   two weeks of the time of my poor Babes Illness,  I have this   comfort that my poor Children seems verry to’rdly, & my Dtr.   Sarah considering her age verry pitty as to her knowledge in   the way of Houskeeping, & on her and my maid Mary Turner.  I   think that pt. must pitty much depend at [pesant]

now   Dear Uncles I shall use some further freedom wth. you, this   Cheange in my ffamily ocasions many thoughts in my mind, one   whereof is to this purpose that since the cause of my   leaving you, my ffriends, & my native Country, is now   remov’d, why shou’d not I return there again, least I shou’d   be taken from my Children & they left more destitute a mong   streangers, but in answer to that, can I think that I should   be brought all the way to this remote pt. of the world for   no other end than to bury my wife, this Country I find more   agreeable to my Health (else it is wth. working harder) this   Country also is governed by more agreeable Laws than that   here are plenty of good ffriends (tho: not my near   Relations) who I believe wd. take care of my Children were I   taken from them, & phaps I may have opptunity to [---] be of   more servis here than there, & thu---] reasoni--] concerning   wch. I desire your sollid Consideration & answer as [---] as   PossibleHowever if you please to Inform me how the woolen trade is   now in Ireland & whether, I am freed from that holding wch.   I was liable to, I am as I mentioned to you before pitty   much Involvd. in Debt & do find it hard to pay Debts wth.   this way of living. corn being low & money scearce, but do   think my self now more at liberty than before to consider of   some other way of making my life Easier, but not by any   alteration soe suddenly as [y.] year

I desire a   pticular account of your [---] familys & my Cousin Wm.   Glaister & of our ffamily in Generall & of ffrds &   neighbours where any alteration has happen’d since my   leaving you,

Soe wth. Dear Love to you all I Conclude   your Loving nephew & affectionate ffriend

Wm   Pim

P:S: the Smallpox continues to spead over this   Country this being the 3d. time of its being here since   settled by the English, it mises but few ffamilyes, & takes   off many heads of familyes especially men in their prime,   here are many widdows now in this County  I am in   expectation of Ja: Nicholson in a little time [p] whom I   expect an act. from Irland & if he dont bring me a servant   or servants I shall be in great want for I am soe now, I   hired. an Indifferant hand lately at Husbandry & it Cost me   36s for 4 weeks (& diat) this has povd. a hard winter &   Spring [fother] is now verry scearce wth. many people but   mine holds out, tho: I lost one cow, yesterday & the night   before here fell a great Snow wch. seems streange to the   people,

My very dear friends —

We have just finished   reading in the Montrose papers, which my daughter Annie   Sayne brought down to me this p.m. – the account of the   Dedication of dear Clemmie’s donation to all the people of   old Susq: Co: & under its inspiration I feel that I must   immediately x x x x –––––––––1908 Jan. 4th –

— To prove that my dear friends have   not been entirely forgotten, – I have the audacity to   continue this letter – begun so long ago as almost to be   forgotten unless it be for this purpose! –  An interruption   occurred, during which time Minnie told me that she was   writing or had written to you, & when I asked where she wd.   address it, she said "Oh, in c/o Misses Biddle – they are in   Montrose". —  I demurred, but neither of us knew theGermantown address & altho’ I said "No. 1. Walnut St."   always held a clue – & had for nearly 100 yrs. past, – but   she laughed, – said that date was obsolete, – & now I doubt   if you ever did get her letter! –  I wish I cd. see you, & I   think our tongues wd. travel fast, –  Writing has become   rather irksome to me, – particularly with pen & ink as my   fingers have very much stiffened in my old age – so I   generally write with a pencil(when I think my frds. will not   object,) & I do not write much, except to my two sons, – who   are in R.R.d business at Sydney,– Nova Scotia. —

— We   have had such a hard summer,– partly owing to the delusions   these conceited Virginians had,– that "all the world & his   wife" wd. almost break their necks to get here to see their   wonderful state & its historic surroundings – then their   disappointments & losses were not cheerful or conducive to   cheery letter writing, & I hate to write doleful letters. —If it were not so pathetic,– it wd. be very amusing to see   the downfall of the hopes they all had of making such   enormous fortunes.–  Hundreds & thousands of dollars have   been lost, for the whole thing was a complete fizzle & not   being completed until away into October, & therefore but   little attendance,– those who did come disparaging it, & the   day after the gates were closed, it was put right into the   hands of a receiver!! –  Virginia has not had such a   staggering blow since Appomattox! –

— We have seen   very little ofMiss Walcott altho we attend the same church, but she lives   at the farther side of our town & the trip involves a   trolley ride- a ferry across Hapton Creek & a walk to each   end of the line.-
I am so sorry to hear of Carrie’s   increased deafness, - & descouraged too.- for I have grown   very deaf myself. & when she had all the medical faculty of   Europe to consult, & they did not cure her, - it is not   worth while for me to try. - Is it hereditary with her?- I   don’t remember either of your parents beingafflicted in that way. –  The strongest point in my memory   about them – is your father’s good sound "orthodox" dignity   – always so cheerily smoothed over, by your Mother’s   beautiful almost angelic smile which brightened almost   everybody & everything around them. –  I don’t wonder he   went to bed, when she was taken from him, & could never be   persuaded to rise again. –  I must close this now for my   messenger to take to the post office. –

— How I do   wish you would come to see us.  I hardly know any one who   would be more welcome. –  Now, think it over & see if you   can’t come,– particularly if a cold wave strikes Germantown.   —

Good bye – in which both my girls join, – don’t   ever doubt me, but believe me always your loving &   affectionate friend
Sibylla T. Morris.

Locust Shade 11.18.1865

My Dear Annie

That   thy very interesting letter has thus long remained   unanswered has been that I have not very often thought of   thee, as I trust thee knowst- and I was much disappointed to   find that I had gone to Germantown a week too soon to see   thee. This to be sure I had but a few hours to stay there,   still I had hoped to spend part of them with thee.- I hope   dear Annie thee is better for thy sojourn at Newport. For I   know the return home without thy father’s welcome must have   been very painful.- even with all the love & kindness of thy   brothers & 
sisters and with the strong consolation thee has of   believing that thy dear parents are forever “where adieus   and farewells are a sound unknown”.- May we realize more &   more the infinite importance of eternal things.- For myself   I seem to glide on day after day occupied with a round of   duties, but in a kind of lethargy in regard to spiritual   things Certainly without that earnest striving which is   commanded & which we may believe is essential to Christian   progress- But confession of our faults avails little without   amendment & I should not burden the with mine. 
We have   parted with our Lizzie to go to Select school. She boards   with John and Sallie Hilles who very kindly offered to take   her- & so far likes her school very much better
than any she ever attended before. I loved that school very   much & whenever I think of it, always see, in my minds eye,-   thee & Julia & Clemmy coming in - &  going to the cloak   room.-
We miss Lizzie exceedingly & I am ready to wonder   how we shall do without her for six months.- She is to come   home after every monthly examination & I long for the time   to arrive.-
Has Clemmy been much with thee lately? I have   scarcely heard of her since her return from Baltimore or of   Julia for a long time- I saw some of George’s pictures   favorably noted in an “art criticism” the other day, at   least I supposed they were his. George B. Wood is his name,   isnt it?
How sad it is that Mary Ann Morris
continued so poorly- tho indeed it is not to be wondered at.   Mary wrote me a few days ago- that she was still much   afflicted with sleeplessness - &  was very nervous. The   former must be most distressing & very [wearing] upon the   constitution.- I hope cousin Eliza will be better for living   in Germantown as the trips out there have done her so much   good. It is to be hoped their walls will not tumble down   before they get moved tho [-----] does not think it would be   son fine &  exciting. – I think their house will be a good   way from you will it not? I am hoping dear Annie to spend a   few days with thee before a very great while- tho I cannot   now see when it will be – probably not for some weeks.- Tho   I do want exceedingly to see thee & as I said before fully   expected to before this. Please write to me when thee feels   like it.- Father  mother have gone out to teaor would said their love- Mine please to thy sister Lizzie &   a large share for thy self from they truly attached   
Susie-

New York 6 mo 17th 1857 —

My dear Anne,

Laura   just brought me up thy letter to read I had been lying down   since dinner and after our journey down to meeting felt like   resting –  I felt almost afraid to go down in the   neighbourhood of the City Hall where we went to Stewart’s to   get some tarleton muslin to see if we could not fold it so   as to cover the cracks of William’s big looking glass – it   will look better and I expect Laura will have it hung in the   spare room, where thee can look at thyself from head to foot   when thee comes on –  felt glad that Rebecca happened to be   out ready to take thy place in waiting on thy mother –   forgot to say why I was afraid to go in the neighbourhood of   the City Hall suppose the papers have informed you of the   riot between the police appointed by the Mayor and those   under the Govenor there was a great time yesterday but I   believeit is all quiet at present.  I suppose they have a queer   sort of a mayor here and I felt a hope that after this   outbreak that a new order of things may be instituted and   that we shall have the Streets cleaned –  I want thee to   tell Anna that I feel so much obliged to her for telling me   of the remedy for dyspepsia  I have been so much better   since I commenced taking it –  I hope that I shall be able   soon to partake with others of what is put on the table.  I   am so fond of clams, and as they are so nice here at New   York and we have them frequently, I feel it quite a   deprivation –  Am able to eat strawberries.  We had them in   abundance at Father’s where we went 7th day evening sisters   Amelia & Hannah were there and several cousins went with us   besides Barclay and the country was so beautiful and so   sweet from the clover fields that it did seem to me quite a   treat – we left second day morning in the cars for New York   –  Came in the accommodation trainby the way of Amboy – it was new to me and I enjoyed it much   more than the other route by Trenton –  Last evening Solon   Robinson one who writes for the "Tribune"* [*Is one of the   editors I am told] spent the evening with us he is a near   neighbour – he wrote the "hot Corn" stories for the Tribune   and lately "a day in the country" which appeared in that   paper – a singular looking man his age is 54 – wears a beard   probably 6 inches long and perfectly white, his hair also   long and white – he told us he had travelled with one pair   of horses from New Orleans to Chicago and from thence to New   York $5000 miles and the horses just ready to run away the   day after he got home – he described his attack of Cholera   on the Missisippi and of the enormous dose of opium, Quinine   &c which they gave him of the former quite an ounce he   thought –  I told him of [Gimre’s] himaepathic potion!–  He   also mentioned an illness of the smallpox and said he had it   as badly as it was possible – upon my remarking that he was   not pitted with it he told me howhe prevented it by covering the pustules immediately upon   breaking with collodion –  Some of the pustules were as   large as a hickory nut, others smaller – but not a place on   his whole person where he could have put a quarter of a   dollar down with out touching some – we were entertained   with his conversation but did not admire him any of us –   quite eccentric –  I did not know he wrote the "hot corn   stories" untill he left – he was down on the beggars said it   was sinful to give indiscriminately seemed to think it was   no use to give to them that they could not be made to help   themselves – that they might as well die one time as another   which quite shocked us to hear him say – he has distributed   about $12000 and I suppose has become totally discouraged in   the prospect of doing any good –  He thinks almost all are   petty thieves –  Laura has had 4 articles taken that she had   put out with ashes in – knows not what to do – they will   take even a barrel and break up for firewood –  Thos Leggett   had their door mat stolen as well as Woodwards’ and the next   door the other side –  We have concluded to keep ours in the   hall as it has escaped hithertoEvery few minutes there is a knock at the basement door –    Robinson says "let them knock and take no notice –" does it   not seem queer that a man that could write so feelingly   about the poor should say so? – but indeed we know not what   to do scarcely and to feel that we do right –  I never saw   such a place –  One evening Thos Leggett was in here about   dark we were all in the basement and a poor little thin   creature like Katy came to ask for something –  Tom thought   he would go with her and see her home which he did and after   he returned he could not speak for tears – the scene of   utter destitution affected him so much –  The father could   not work had the ague and he thought that they looked as if   they had all become thin through want of food – she had been   coming here almost daily for food since –  This morning we   saw a group of little ones the largest girl carrying a box   which looked to be an ash box and Laura thought looking back   apprehen-sively.  We thought they had stolen it.  Robinson may feel   more than he pretends to about them –  We heard he wrote for   a long time "City Items" for the Tribune and they almost all   contained some interesting incidents respecting the poor –   he informed us he possessed remarkably  descriptive powers   that nothing he saw escaped his notice &c.  We concluded he   must be a genius and consequently eccentric – he told us he   had an adopted daughter that always shaves him – cuts his   hair makes  all his clothes with the assistance of a sewing   machine as well as all her own sewing and sometimes  her   shoes –  William thinks it likely she is one perhaps that he   has rescued –
We found Nealie here after we returned from   meeting we are all invited up there Seventh day (Barclay and   ourselves)– we expect to go if they get a cook–  A few days   ago an old servant of theirs dropped down dead whilst at   work in the kitchen which was a great shock to them they had   to have a coroners inquest – Laura says perhaps we will go   and take Martha tocook whilst we stay –  Laura has engaged the nicest little   girl to run errands do chamber work  &c – she does work   admirably  sews beautifully – irons &c  they think she will   suit them better than a larger girl – she is a trim little   thing with beautiful hair which she has always in nice order   – got a very good character of her – the gentleman she lived   with (a lawyer) wrote her character – that she was the best   child he had ever known in her capacity – they parted with   her in consequence of going out West –
I do not remember    whether I told you about the Cornell’s friends of Hannah   Leggett who board with them the elder (Eliza) has been a   teacher in one of the best schools in the city received a   salary of $600 – she is going to be married in about three   weeks to Albert Smiley.  she is a sweet looking girl as well   as a younger sister with whom Barclay has become  well   acquainted – JL Woodward is very much interested in them –   he likes young company – when Laura told his wife that she   thought perhaps some of hercousins would come home  with us – she said "Mr Woodward   will be delighted"  We are to take tea there this evening –   Leggetts & ourselves –
5th day.  We heard that Mayor Wood   was obliged to accept warrants from the Metropolitan police   who accompanied by Gen Sandford presented them to him—he is   under arrest – I feel anxious to hear what has transpired to   day –  Lewis & William and every New Yorker I expect are so   much interested –  Wood has behaved  so badly –  It was   thought that Sandford had acted with great circumspection   and he was the hero of the day – but if the Mayor had not   submitted, he told him that the law would be enforced at the   point of the bayonet – happily yesterday passed without   bloodshed –  The mayor with his 800 policemen were in the   City Hall = It was suggested that they might be starved into   submission by preventing egress –
Well Anne dear I hope   thy foot will not trouble thee long it was the best thing to   take care in time of a sprained ancle – such a useful little   body as thee has become  cannot be spared very well –  Laura   joins me in love to all at Awbury – will write soon to thee   herself as I have more time on my hands I have taken the pen   this time and shall be glad 
to have a reply –  I am   looking for an answer to my letter from Julia soon we do   enjoy getting letters so far away from all of you –Must now say farewell as my sheet is filled and remain as   ever thy very affectionate Aunt Martha

My dear   friend
Rachel C. Evans.

In carrying out our   program for Switzerland, the weather has suddenly changed   from intense heat and a very long drought to a rain of   several days, which while most grateful to the parched   country, interferes materially with views of the charming   Lake of Geneva and the mountains that environ it. Instead   therefore, of our usual outdoor life, this gives just the   opportunity for which I've been wishing, to acknowledge some   of the very kind farewell greetings, received as we left our   native shores. The weather being so variable, it has seemed   best for one to remain in this most comfortable   Eng.-speaking pension, with a delightful out-look upon the   Lake, while my dear Hannah has gone into the 
upper regions, so as to get into closer touch with their   sublime peaks--at least so far as the fickle weather may   permit. Meanwhile therefore, my pen is giving me congenial   occupation in-doors.
Among the loving remembrances to   which I have referred, is thine from Franconia, U. N. of   [--] 28--I was truly glad also thus to receive good accounts   from you, and can only trust your outing in the bracing air   of New Eng. may be permanently helpful to thyself and your   dear Anna, of whom I often think with tender sympathy,   desiring that "the best of Physicians"--may keep her under   his all-wise and loving care. Turning away therefore, from   misgivings, or fears, or failures as they may seem to her,   may there be a more "continual looking into Jesus", not only   "as the author", but "the finisher of her faith". Let her   ever remember that it is this same Saviour of our's, who has   begun his work of grace in her heart that seeks to carry it   on and perfect it
to his praise, and her unspeakable peace. He knows her   better than she knows herself; and therefore, none so well   as He can "speak to her condition". It is thus He has   revealed himself to multitudes of struggling souls, and they   never seek His face in vain. Then it is that anxiety gives   place to a quiet childlike confidence in Him, and impatience   as to a more rapid growth in grace than we may have yet   known finds us more continually dwelling upon the abounding   love of God, and brings about that "patient waiting for   Christ", which the apostle craves for his fellow   believers.
While our best desires are turned in this   direction, there is nothing incompatible with the fullest   appreciation of the outward favors & blessings with which   our Heavenly Father has surrounded us. Indeed, we now   realize that these he has "given us richly to enjoy". We   recognize His good hand in them all, and so a continual   thanksgiving goes up from our hearts to Him, as the   all-bountiful giver. I see little to add to the few
hints as above, and would have thee to use them or not, only   as way may open--Indeed I can quite believe that, if a   fitting, natural opening does not occur, it may be best to   speak to Anna of nothing beyond my continued loving interest   in her.
As to the results of our own rambling, I may   thankfully say that, for myself, there seems a marked gain   in several respects, but, as thou has intimated, the full   benefit of such changes is sometimes felt later. My dear   Hannah could scarcely be in better condition for enjoying to   the full the scenes of rare interest and beauty thr'o which   we are and have been passing. I think however, we shall both   be glad when the time for our return voyage shall have come.   This will be 10/5, by the "Haverford", for Phila, and   shortly after, if the Lord will, we may hope to be once more   among our dear home friends--Please remember us in love to   Jon., while I remain

very sincerely thy friend
Sam   Morris

Springfield. Mass. Aug. 31st
4th day eve.

Dear   Papa & Mama,
We rec’d your letters this morning just as   we started & were very glad to get them, tho’ sorry to think   they came too late to engage rooms for you at the Cliff   House we were very anxious to hear from you in time, but you   were so long making up your minds, that we almost came to   the conclusion you were not going to at all, & had given it   up.  However Uncle H. thinks there will be no trouble in   getting them by writing afterwards.  We left Newport at 7   o’clock this morning & dined at Worcester very comfortably   about 2 o’clock & arrived here at 6 1/2 about.  Thishotel is delightful, they say it is one of the best in the   Union Sallie Parish says “its where all the brides come to,”   I haven’t seen any yet!  We got a splendid supper & Uncle   Harry & Chell & I took a little stroll through the town  it   seems very pretty as far as gas and star-light would show.    But me thinks we will not see much more of it, we propose   leaving quite early tomorrow morning for [Mt.] Holyoke.    Aunt Mary says “that all things considered she is certainly   remarkably well,” last 1st day she says she felt better than   she has for a year.  She is certainly improved, but don’t   raise your hopes to high or I fear you will be disappointed   – She’s better, but not well.  
They are talking,   talking! all the time, & I can’t write, Aunt [K]. has a very   nice room on the secondfloor, & Chell, Ginnie, & I have three cots put up in an   adjoining private parlor, its quite fine we’re all seated   round the centre table with a bright gas-light above us & a   velvate carpet beneath us, & the most delightful easy chairs   aren’t we splendid?  
Uncle H. says our present intention   is to come home in the 2 o’cl train 7th day (if the   time-table is right) I think we’ll not get out [--] 4, if we   change our plans we’ll telegraph.  Now Mother I must stop   for I want to fix my hat & its getting late.  Aunt M. says   she would have written but she has been retrimming Anna’s   hat & had no time.  Love to all
very   affec’ly
Lillie

P.S.  Resolved-that we take dinner   at Aunt [Annas], & come in quarter before 4P.S.  resolved that you need not expect us till we   come
P.S.  thats wrong!
P.S.  We will probably come   out in the 9 o’clock cars taking tea at the   Continental.
P.S.  Still talking can’t tell if this be   the final decision!
P.S.  Final decision! Seriously!  It   is extremely difficult to fix our plans, & we will   positively come home on 7th day either 1/4 4 or 9 o’cl   trains.
P.S.  Uncle Harry thinks we ought to give a   reason for our indecision.  Reason That we can not find   beforehand how long it will take to visit Mt. Holyoke as we   have to drive part of the way, & that makes it uncertain   whether we will reach New Haven tomorrow night or the next   day

Rockview Cottage
6 mo 4th 1864 –

My dear   Anne,

From cloud land do I now address thee it has   been raining, raining for days – but we cannot wish it   otherwise as it will raise the mountain springs which were   beginning to fail rapidly it has been rather an anxious care   with us to watch the springs for fear they would give out   before the cisterns were prepared to save the water and the   steam pumps were fixed so that the pure water might be   available for the sick in the Hospitals there are but about   500 patients now but it is hoped that the large field   Hospital at Chattanooga may soon be moved up here and   probably two thirds of the patients that would otherwise die   might recover I think there had been but four deaths since   the Hospital was established here  The air is so fine and   the water runningthrough sand stone rocks the sweetest that could be and I   sometimes think the patients would recover without medicine   –  Several patients extremely ill with pneumonia have lived   although Dr H said they must die –
When it does clear I   expect we shall have one of these magnificent cloud scenes –   Sunshine and blue sky above whilst below us a billowy sea of   clouds looking as if they were frozen as they formed –  I   imagine it must look precisely like an Artic sea –  We have   witnessed two such scenes when it had been raining heavily –   the whole valley completely hid except about half way up the   Mountain –  Anna Harlow is describing some of the cloud   scenes we have had beautifully alluded to the psalm where   they are so grandly described and which we can appreciate   from having witnessed the clouds in their grandeurabove and below us as well as like the present time we have   been for days enveloped in the thick clouds –  "The waters   stood above the mountains At Thy rebuke they fled – at the   voice of thy thunder they hasted away –  They go up by the   Mountains they go down by the valleys unto the place which   thou hast founded for them –  He watereth the hills from his   chambers" &c–  There are many beautiful scenes so much so   that I could not picture them to thee –  I know thee would   enjoy many of the views that are on every hand, not only   from their beauty but from the historic interest that even   now induces people by hundreds to come up the Mountain to   see the celebrated "Lookout" and the scenes in the valley   below us –  I never was at a more charming place I think –    The other day some ladies from Philada. Ellen Parrish sister   to Robert A Parrish and Dr Janney’s daughter spent two days   at our house (and rather inconveniently,two nights as we were obliged to give up our room and our   husbands had to sleep on the floor –  they had come on a   mission of relief to E Tennessee refugees and had become   acquainted with the Commander of the post Col Culver who   offerred them facilities to go to the Lake and Falls about   six miles distant –  Lewis & myself accompanied the party –    It was a scene of rare beauty –  The Falls are not large but   very high and fall in shimmering spray down the most   beautiful rocks –  It seemed to me as though every thing had   been brought to bear to make the place charming  The rocks   of various hues and shaded seemed cut into the most   picturesque forms whilst the clear mountain stream came over   its clean and clear rocky bed & went down the precipice to   the height of 125 feet –  Another face below us which we   could discover by the Mist we did not get to visit –The slopes were covered with Rhodedendron of very large   flower and Laurels and the [Fringe] tree growing wild –  We   came away reluctantly and all of us thought I have no doubt   that we either would visit it again or would more than ever   desire to do so –  The next day being First day our   neighbours Dr Ridgleys who had been up but a few days   started to go there on horseback there were six of them one   of the party told me that she went feeling rather afraid   that it was not right – they had got quite a distance beyond   the pickets and they must have been very near the Falls I   judge when as they were a little off the roadside resting   off their horses they saw a man dressed in Rebel uniform,   grey cloth and brass buttons passed right by them [leading]   his horse and did not take notice of them – one of the   gentlemen called after him after he passed – "My kind sir   where do you belong?" he repliedat General Thomas’ Headquarters.  They all believed him to   be a rebel officer and as he had a large revolver and they   were unarmed he could have captured the whole of them – they   were pretty much frightened and concluded to turn their   horses heads homeward and did not see the Falls – so much   for their pleasure party on First day –  In speaking of it   it was remarked that sometimes our scouts go dressed in   Rebel uniform – it might have been one of them –  There is   another very beautiful place called "Rock City"–  The brow   of this Mountain is crowned with soft kind of Rocks which   look as if some day had been washed and rounded by water   covering them –  Geologists would say they had –  At Rock   City these rocks cover the ground, at one place like a town   and at another we walked over them and gathered the most   beautifullichens and mosses x_, red green & drab, [x  with most   remarkable fissures & clefts all through them] I only wish   we could send you some specimens –  I think we might by   "Adams Express" sometime before we go away when the   facilities [of] transportation are more available than they   are here at present there have been some moms gathered and   sent to the different Fairs for the benefit of the Sanitary   Com. as well as lots of Canes–  The roots of the Laurel are   very hard and beautifully grained large quantities are dug   and articles made of them as mementoes of the place –  Our   Ben has quite a lot which the soldiers gave him when they   went to the Front – which he sells as well as canes to   increase his fortune –
Thee may be very sure that I was   much gratified upon receiving thy kind little note –  I had   not forgotten my promise to write to thee but supposing thee   often heard from us through my Children I did not know   whetherthee cared particularly about my writing added to which I   rather feel averse to tell the same thing over again –   although there is not any lack of incident here –  We have   been living very quietly here the past three months –  We   have had some acquisitions to the place lately but need not   feel alarmed at their being very extensive, without people   build for themselves or live in tents –  As I raise my eyes   I see the tents of Major Mc’Michael and one or two others in   the woods at one side of us – they look very pretty – he is   Adjat to Gen Thomas – is the son of Morton McMichael of   Philada. on the other side is the cottage of Dr Ridgley   Medical Purveyor with two ladies boarding with them and Capt   Edwards from Penn Wife & daughter who board with one of the   old residents are all the Society here except ourselves A   part of an Engineer Brigade about600 men the Officers Hospital of 100 men and convalescents   of the number of 400 are all that live here except three or   four families who have remained through all and are entirely   dependent for provision for what they can purchase through   exchange –  They sell their milk at from 50 cts to $1.00 per   gal eggs 75 cts per doz butter 75 cts per lb and have been   getting in exchange from us flour at 3 1/2 cts per lb sugar   14 cts per lb –  They charge for butter milk 75 & 80 cts per   gal and can get it readily as it is so desirable for the   sick –
I have often recurred to the time I spent at your   house last Spring when I was with you in sympathy by the   Suffering bed of thy dear Mother –  I never witnessed such   suffering and I never recur to it perhaps but with Something   of the tender feelingsthat then pervaded my heart –  I dare say thee often feels   lonely without her dear Anne – but no doubt thee thinks that   thy loss is her gain and that she would not wish to exchange   her bliss in Heaven for any earthly thing – there was a   great deal that was pleasant and sweet that she left below –   Many that have the tastes to enjoy the beautiful could not   have them gratified like the inmates of such a home as you   have but with it all I often felt sorrowful that dear sister   was deprived of the use of her eyes which to me would have   been terrible – but all things have been ordered aright we   cannot doubt –  I would be very glad to hear from thee as   often as thee feels like writing to thy absent but not the   less interested and affectionate 
Aunt Martha –
Please   give my love to Father and all the inmates of your home –

Bristol July 13. 1771 – 7th day 1 oClock
My dear   Sister

My Henry came here last evening in seeming   good spirits but indifferent Health; he eat a very light   supper, and sett off this morning (after a poor breakfast)   about 8 oClock.  He has a fine day, and I hope riding and   relaxation from business will restore him; he talked of   returning to Bristol on 5th day or perhaps not untill 7th   day next.  Thy continued Confinement and constant care give   me many an anxious minute; but I trust the time will come   when it may please kind Providence to make things easier to   thee.  I was not quite so well yesterday as usual & my dear   Henrys coming to me so unwell gave me pain.  I am quite   bravely to day after coming out of the water but full of   thought about my dear little crowing Henry.  Doct. D.*   [*Denormandie] came here last evening, and, after the usual   salutation, said to me, he was come to have some serious   talk with me; I smiled; nay said he I am in earnest; about   what Doctor? – weaning your little son; such a hearty   growing boy, who seems to live upon you, is enough to draw a   pain in a weakly person, where there had never been one   before; besides he keeps you waking at nights, and prevents   your using means that might restore you; if it was not on   his account you might now go with Mr. Drinker to the sea   shore, and so forth.  There are several women here who I   beleive have put it into the Doctors head that I ought not   to suckle the Child.  My Henry seconded him, and said he   would write this morning to thee, but as he was poorly, I   undertook to do it.–  Do not think my dear, from what I have   written, that I am worse; Indeed I am not through mercy, but   have had the pain in my breast oftener than I had sometime   ago, which I told the Doctor.  I beleive that if I had a   Girl with me that was worth a fig, it would be different,   for the one I have has no knack of making the Child fond of   her.  Doctr. D. says as Doctr. Evans knows my Constitution,   he would have him spoken to. –  I would have thee see the   Doctor and talk with him.  Patty would do a great deal   better than the Girl I have, and should she offer again, I   would not have thee entirely discourage her, but tell her   thee beleives the girl I have does not suit me, and if she   thinks she can behave so as to please me, thee would have   her call again.  It will be time enough (after theehas spoken to Doct. Evans) to come to any conclusion when my   Henry returns.  I had a room full of visitors yesterday   afternoon; two Chariotts full besides others; T. Ringold &   Wife from Maryland; Sally Hoffman, Sukey Pintard, her sister   Boudinott from New York; Serlis’ wife, Betsy Tilghman from   Philada. and Billy Coxe’s daughter, and Sally Tredwell the   Doctors sister.  We all went in the evening to Bath.  I go   but little a visiting, and they all think that my little   dear keeps me at home, and every ones cry is wean him, wean   him; thee would be charmed to see the dear little fellow,   how he daily improves in cunning antick tricks.  I long to   see thee and my dear Children, but dont know how to bring it   about.  My Henry was saying that he was well pleased that I   did not get his letter by Billy Hodge (as he had mentioned   thy being unwell) as thee is now better. – I would have thee   my dear take half a spoonful of the Elixir every day to   strengthen thee.  I have not had occasion to take any since   I came up as yet, but thee knows it was of great use to me   taken in small quantity.  I have been but a little while   writing thus far, but as I have not stopped since I began, I   grow tired, and my dear little one is crying for me; My dear   love is to thee & to my sweet Children, to whom I intend to   write when I can conveniently; they must not be impatient,   but good and kind to each other, & very dutiful & mindful of   their Aunty’s will, which will give great pleasure to their   very affectionate mammy
I am, my dear Sister, thine &c   –
E. Drinker

My dear, dear, kind Henry looked so   unwell as he slept this morning as made my heart ache; he   was last night more than commonly chearful, which I have   observed often to be the case when he is unwell.  how unlike   the generality of Mankind is he in his natural disposition   many ways.  he was last night at supper affectionately   acknowledging thy tender care of him, & saying how clever it   was to have two Wives.  We were likewise wishing that it was   convenient to thee to spend one month here, free from care   of us & ours. –  I hope it may please God to spare me and   restore me to health for my Henrys sake, & that I may be   enabled to make up in some measure to my dear Husband and   Sister their many, many kindnesses to me; but shouldshould it happen otherwise, may I be enabled to say, the   Lords will be done. –

5 oClock – Billy Parr has been   here; he says he saw thee, & that you are all well.  he has   gone to Trenton, where Peggy, Nancy and Caleb are to go   tomorrow; they want me to go, but I shall not.  Molly Foulke   is expected here this evening or in the morning.  Mag.   Divine next second day, so that we shall have the house   full.  Peggy gives her love to thee.  Henry’s asleep, & I am   going to Bath.  farewell my dear Sister for the   present.
E.D.
I wrote yesterday by S. Le Gay, which   letter I suppose thee has received.  I make no doubt but my   dear Henry will return bravely.  tomorrow will be a lonesome   day to me.  my love to neighbour James –

April 22nd 1907

Dear Cousin Nettie,

I am very   much ashamed of receiving your postal this morning, that I   had not acknowledged the receipt of your package of pastals.   We enjoyed looking at them, and I locked them up with your   others.  My only excuse is that I have been kept very busy   lately.  For two months or more we have not had a girl, the   one we had had since the fall, left without any notice   saying she was sick, a good general house-work girl is very   hard to get, and I dislike changing very much, and I   proposed
that we should do without one till we went to Pocono, as the   old woman we have had there three years wants to go again.    We have to hire two or three times a week, which does not   make our wages much less, but it is a saving in other ways.    Of course it gives me more to do and keeps me more at home,   but on the whole have gotten along very nicely.  For the   last ten days we have been enjoying a visit from Beckie and   Margaret, they think they must go back in a few days.    Mother just now is pretty well, but she has suffered this   winter a great deal from rheumatism, is not quite free from   it yet; it has been a hard winter for that.  We had had acold spring, to-day is warmer, and should not wonder if we   jumped right into Summer, but hope not as Mother feels the   heat very much, and although we would like to go to Pocono   in May, we do not want to go till Dick, Mitchell's son, who   boards with us, is thrugh college, which will be early in   June.  Cousin Mary Smith is going to board with us all   Summer, which we are very glad of.  Charlie has been invited   to preach at Pocono June 23rd so hope we will be there   before that, so to have a little visit from him; he was not   able to get up last Summer.  There was a woods fire up there   about two weeks ago, and a cottage quitenear us was burned.  We were so thankful that ours escaped,   for we would have been lost if it had gone.  Augusta Hazard   was in Philadelphia a few weeks ago, she asked if we had   heard from you lately.  I must apologize for the blots I   have just made, as I have not time to re-write it.  With   much love to you both from Mother, Beckie and my-self.    Mother wants to write to you, but she does not write as much   as she used to.  Affectionately your cousin

Laurel House July 19th

My  dear Mama,
Rachel has   spent herself so in writing to thee that it seemed hardly   worth while for me to try, so I thought I wld. wait till her   fever was over, & as this eve. she seemed little inclined to   desert the piazza, I concluded to undertake the task.  We   have had a most exercising day in all senses of the word,   but so wonderful is the effect of this mountain air that I   do not feel the least tired.  In the first place this   morning we set off in an open wagon for Haines’ fall a   pleasant ride of about 2 miles, but it was after we got   there the “tug of war” began –  We hada regular scramble, part of the way was so rough that Tom &   Walter concluded to remain behind & before we got through   there was no one left but Harry Ellie & Madge & I, we went   down to the very foot of the lower falls, & were well   repaid; it was a most beautiful spot, a succession of six   lovely little falls ending in cascades & rapids, it was   altogether quite charming, the prettiest place of the kind I   ever saw, & I don’t remember ever to have seen a photograph   of it –  We did not get home till after the dinner bell had   rung, so were obliged just to give a little smoothe to our   hair, & go in in our mountain dresses, but every thing is   very primitive here, & nobody pretends to dress for dinner.    As we were all preparedwe concluded instead of changing our dresses to go after   dinner down the stream about a mile to Bastion falls under   Tom’s piloting, & soon comes in the adventure – we just got   to the head of the fall, & were [nerving] ourselves for a   scramble to the foot, when some one remarked that it was   raining, & sure enough it was, we took shelter under some   trees and concluded it wld. soon be over, & we would wait,   but it got harder & harder, & at last found its way through   the branches, & came down on us in large drops, which were   decidedly wetting, we tried it for a little while, but   finding there was no sign of stopping & we were getting very   wet we concluded to push on home, –  At first it seemed to   have slaked alittle, but it soon began harder than ever, & we went   tearing along jumping over rocks & through bushes till we at   last arrived at the foot of the Kauterskill, & then there   were all those dreadful stairs to go up – however we pushed   on, & at last arrived panting at the house – we were pretty   objects to be sure all wet, & draggled, & hot – there were   several gentlemen sitting round on the piazza, & I thought   it a remarkable instance of politeness that they did not   ever smile, I’m sure I could not have resisted it.  Of   course we retired immediately to our appartments, & changed   every thing making ourselves most comportable & desidedly   more presentable.  Thee need not feel the least concern for   I don’t think we are any of us a bitthe worse, & the most remarkable part is we are not tired.    The only thing that suffered was our hats, but I guess they   will look pretty well when they dry, & we’ll have to retrim   them at Newport –  Thee must be sure & not forget my bonnet   so that if we should arrive 7th day night I may have   something to wear to meeting.  Also mother I think I forgot   to put on the list a thin white body of mine & my best   underbody that I wanted to have done up & brought in the   trunk – Virginia will know.  Tom wrote to Father yesterday   to go by 7th days steamer, & one of us will try to write by   the next.  We are having a most delightful time, & as thee   willsee by my account I am as well as possible, so thee need not   have any anxiety on my account.  I do hope you are getting   along nicely, & don’t feel very lonely, I know thee must   miss Father very much, but I hope he will be a great deal   better for his voyage & come home to us quite strong, & free   from all those miserable head-aches.  
Aunt L & Chell   send love, & the former says she is intending to write to   thee very soon.  
Give a great deal of love to all, &   Virginia especially I want to write to her, she was so very   kind in helping me to get ready to come away, I don’t know   what I should have done without her.  
Good-night dear   Mama,
thy ever loving
Lily

Downingtown Octor. 21. 1802.
My very dear   Son,

This ridiculous whim which thou hast adopted has   given me more pain than I can express,  I cannot conceive   what should induce thee, who is settled in the way thee   wished, on a good farm, which thee knows so well how to   manage and improve, without paying rent: To take it into thy   mind to leave thy all; a young family of precious children,   and parants in precarious health, to go 9000 miles on a   tempestuous sea, in the most dangerous season of the year,   art thou insane?  What can be thy inducement: compare thy   situation with hundred that are quite happy and contented;   Why art thou not so?  Why this unsettled idea? –  If thee   puts this scheme in practice, I hardly expect ever to see   thee again in this world, – even if thou should be spared to   return to those of thy friends that may be left –  Thee   wrote before we left town on this subject to thy father, But   I never saw the letter, WD. told me thee talk’d of going to   India, I expected thy father had wrote thee, and that it was   the thought of a moment that was now given over; thy letter   to thy father and brother rec’d yesterday, I might have   read, but that to William was enough for me, to think thou   art in earnest is more than I can, at times well bear –   consider well, my dear son what thou art [preparing]:   perhaps on thy return, if thou should be so favoured, thee   may find thy parants no more; and some of thy little ones   gone &c.  This is thee may say looking at the worst side of   things, but pray inform me what is the best side,  I see no   good that is likely to result from it–  Can thy scheme be a   view of money making, if so, will the little gain, thy   hardships may obtain, be equal to the loss and devastation   that may occur during thy absence–  do my dear Henry give up   this wild notion, be thankful for what thou hast, make the   best of it, and I trust, more will be added, if ‘tis   necessary for thee.–  thou hast, according to my ideas great   cause ofthankfulness –  thou mayst have trials that I know not of,   but going to the worlds-end will not cure them –  If “an   exemption from evil is a real good” how many evils art thou   exempt from? – be content and resign’d. –  If the former   desire of a trip to Great Britain had revived in thy mind   (tho I should hardly think it would in thy present   situation, and in those times of trouble) I should not   oppose it, at a suitable time of the year, if thou could   leave thy family and farm with propriety:  but this   East-India notion may be ruineous if put in practice –    There is no one that loves thee but would be grieved at such   a procedure – not a single word has past between thy father   and myself on this business, till [ye] day he recd. thy last   letter, when I mentioned my very great concern on thy acct.   he say’d it was a rediculous foolish whim –  Do my dearest   Henry give over all thoughts of leaving all that is near and   dear to thee for a phantom, and if thee does, I am of the   first oppinion thee will never have reason to repent it. –   Thee may remember when thee first concluded to be a Farmer,   I oppos’d it, wishing thee near me while I lived – but   seeing thee seem’d fixed in that way, I gave up my wishes –   and since, the frequent attacks of malignant fever in our   City, I think I may truly say, I have been thankful thee was   so well and happily, as I thought, settled on a good Farm –   where I hope thee will content thyself and remain. –  Jacob   Downing has been several days in and near the City, he wrote   to Sally that the fever was worse, a greater number of new   cases, than at any other time, Dr. Rush told him it wd. be   very improper for our family to return, as there was several   ill, not far from us. –  Joseph Downing has been very unwell   with fever and pain in his head, not yellow fever, he is   rather better – last week we had concluded to return home on   first or second day last, but hearing of the death of a   baker not far from us, and two cases in Elfriths’ Alley, and   several in [Keys’] alley, thy father gave it over for [ye]   present, ‘tho he is very desireous of being at home – To be   seperated from my Children at those times of difficulty is a   trial to me.  Our dear Nancy who has been at times unwell,   has been much in my thoughts, ‘till Iread thy letter to thy brother, which has filled my mind   with little else but thee –  Thy dear father has had many   attacks of his old complaint, and frequently disordered   bowels, has taken liquid ladanum every night for some weeks   past, he is at present better of the gravelly complaint, but   not well in his bowels.–  A Letter, or rather small packet   directed by thee to James Smith came here by some mistake   with thy other two – thy father has sent it back to the City   –  I hope ‘ere long to see thee, after mature deliberation,   fully convinced of thy mistake – which will be a very great   satisfaction to thy trully affectionate mother E.   Drinker

No one here knows any thing of thy intention   that I know of, not a word of it has been mention’d – indeed   it is a subject that we cant bear to talk on  My love is to   Hannah and the Dear Children –Paid 10

Laurel House July 21st/67

My dear Father,
Tom has   written to thee so very lately, that I fear I can hardly   find enough of interest to fill a second letter, & besides I   am almost afraid to write one to go so far, & cost so much;   but perhaps a little Cattskill news would not be unwelcome.    We have been here for several days but owing to the   unkindness of the weather have not been able to accomplish   as much as we could wish – we made one very successful   expedition to Haines’ falls on 6th day morning, we took a   carriage or rather an express-wagon & rode over there, & had   a fine scramble, we went down the stream to the lower falls,   & scrambleddown to the foot, Tom concluded not to go all the way as it   was so rough & hard, & one after another gave out until when   we arrived at the foot there was no one but Harry, Ellie,   Madge & I left, but we were very glad we persevered &   thought ourselves well repaid, you never told us last fall   how beautiful it was.  We did not get home till after they   had gone to dinner so were obliged to go in just as we were   in our mountain dresses, & as we were all prepared concluded   to go under Tom’s guidence to visit Bastion falls   afterwards.  So about 4 we set off prepared to have a very   jolly time, Tom went ahead and cleared the way, & we   followed jumping over the logs & stones which Thomas   declare[d] were not there last fall, & must be the result of   last winters slide;Just as we arrived at the head of the fall, & were   congratulating ourselves on the prospect before us, what   should it do but begin to rain!  At first we thought it   would only be a little shower, & took shelter under the   trees as there were unfortunately no overhanging rocks –   this did very well for a little while, but instead of   stopping the rain got harder & harder, & at last began to   find its way through the trees & onto us – we soon found   ourselves getting very moist, & began to confer on measures   of relief, it was at length concluded as we were already   quite wet, & there was no sign of stopping to start for   home.  At first it seemed to slacked a little & we pushed   bravely on, but it got faster & faster & by the time we   reached the foot of Cauterskillwe were thoroughly drenched & in despair at having to ascend   all those dreadful steps – I wish thee could have seen us as   we came up to the house too tired to run any more dragging   along all dripping & hot, looking as much as possible like   drowned rats.  The gentlemen on the piazza were so polite as   not even to smile, but I’m sure I could not have helped. it.   I don’t think we any of us suffered for it though, & I did   not even feel tired in the evening, this mountain air is so   invigorating.  Yesterday it rained perseveringly & we had to   amuse ourselves as best we could reading, & walking on the   piazza.  The company here is not as congeneal as we could   wish, & we often envy Aunt Annie & Cous. Clem in their   Adirondack society.  One young gentleman regaledus last night with some Scotch songs, but it was very   inferior to Carry Rowland’s performance.  I think Tom told   thee that we have the same room you had last year, & enjoy   it very much, it is so nice having that beautiful view   always before us, I think I enjoy it much more than the map   in front of the Mountain House; it is so constantly   changing, sometimes that distant mountain will be entirely   hid by the clouds, & it is so beautiful to see them coming &   going; we have had no perfectly clear weather since we   arrived, & have become almost discouraged, & the   chamber-maid told me by way of comfort yesterday, that it   sometimes rained strait aheadfor a week, however it really does look like clearing now,   the clouds are drifting away, & there are great patches of   blue-sky.  If it is clear tomorrow we have planned an   expedition to the Plauterkill which I hope will be a   success.  Tom Stokes & Harry had intended starting on a   fishing excursion yesterday but after routing out of their   beds about 4, & eating sandwitches preparatory to starting,   were obliged to give up on account of the rain, & go back to   bed in disgust.  We have only received one letter from home   which reported all well, but by the time this reaches thee   thee will have received more recent news.  All send their   love & wishes for thy welfare wh. means I suppose that they   hope thee is not awfully sick, in which I heartily join,   Thee must notimagin from my description that we are not having a good   time for we are only the rain was a little dampening but   since the sun has come out we feel very lively & up to any   amount of of scrambling.  Write by every steamer & tell us   every thing.
Thy very affectionate
Lily

By   William Drinker who pass’d Here on the 9th  I receivd thy   remembrance of the 3d inst–  What Charles Miner has done or   is now about I cannot precisely say not hav[ing] seen Him or   any of his friends since [my] Last

Mr Arndt on whom I depended for [the]   Hemlock Bark Has not yet ground it but I hope He will attend   to it shortly–  if it in any degree succeeds [in] England it   will be Highly important to this Count[r]y as well as   convenient to ship overseas–  I beleive that the mak[ing]   pot & pearl Ash might prove an advantageous thing to us more   than to any other persons [We] owning the nearest Large Body   of suitable timber for the purpose – if it will pay for its   mak[ing] & a reasonable sum for outlay & superintendance it   will answer us as a means of clear[ing] Land –
I am glad   that thy mind is made up for a peep at this quarter of the   world – I think it will be likely to be beneficial to thy   Health as also to Aunts – Some Rough travell[ing] there will   no doubt be – but generaly speak[ing] the Roads are   tolerable to the mouth of Tunkhannock–  Thereare no excelent Taverns on the Route so far as I am   acquainted–  I think the one Here is the Best & likely to be   the most pleasant for the Residence of aunt–  Gentlemen can   be well accomodated at Easton & at Wilkes barre at Mr Whites   in the first nammed place & at Mr Arndts in the second in   Both Houses there is Rather too much noise and Drink[ing] to   be entirely agreeable to Ladies –  Here also we have more   noise than is pleasant–  There be from 15 to 20 of Stoddarts   work[ing] hands quart[ere]d in the House –  
The Road by   Easton is Rather worse than that by Bethlehem & Nazareth & I   think generaly the accommodations are better on this last   Route–  from Nazareth to Hellers at the Wind gap at which   House I have generaly procured tolerable Eating & pretty   clean–  from thence about 17 miles to William Sox’s upon the   top of Pokono – where th[e]y make prety good coffee & give   you what ever they may Have in the House in a tolerably   cleanly stile–  from thence to this place say 12 miles   –
The present is about as pleasant a Time to Travel in   this county as any other Dur[ing] the summer – ere the grain   is cut which will not be Done before the Last of next monthHowever the Weather is now variable and we may expect   occasional Rains, until after Harvest – 
in the Last of   August & to the middle of September is generaly more settled   weather – as to the [Gnats] they Have already come & in the   woods Bite sharply–  This [they] will continue to Do until   September – But out of the woods we do not find them   Troublesome– There are not any curiosities worthy a name   from Philada to this place–  The Habits & manners of the   people on the Route may perhaps afford Something novel – The   scenery also & general Aspect of the County will be new –   [marbly] nature in Her Roughest garb will surround you – you   will have pure Air & pure water & I doubt not to good   [appetites] as to enable you to Encounter much coarser fare   than usual – in the neighbourhood of Easton-Bethlehem &   Nazareth is a lime stone county – & I would have you beware   of the water – it is no doubt wholesome but to persons   [unaccustomed] to it it is often unpleasant in its effects–   if I know when you intend com[ing] up I will endeavor to   join you at Hellers – I have been constantly interupted   since I began writing which must excuse this   scrawl–

Oh Poesy! what wight of Wretched State

With what now ‘neath Heaven’s weary blessing   grows

From   out the salt salt wave fair Venus rose
Graceful her   dripping locks she round her did dispose

I am pleased to hear that you are   all well and that you are enjoying your travel so much  I   very much hope that it will prove particularly beneficial to   thee –  Tell the boys I quite long to peruse their   interesting journals.  I hope they relate anecdotes and   retail conversations – tell Tommy I expect his will be   humourous and Franky’s abstruse –  Mary’s no doubt will be   quite correct and modestly written as she is so quiet about   it
How gratified William must be with your visit do   persuade him to fit up his handsome house and get a wife to   take care of it.–  I wonder that the idea should have to be   suggested to himSister Frances in her last letter to me desires me to write   particularly about thy health and Sister Rs and desires her   love to be given.  Is she not a lovely woman?  She is so   intelligent affectionate and sprightly –  I love her very   much –  She says that she would have been delighted if we   had visited her but that now she could not ask us at [a--]   [s--] as her children have the whooping cough –  Mother   Pleasants has gone to New York yearly meeting to be absent a   couple of weeks –  She invited Mother and Aunt M Leeds to   spend the day with her before she went, with us but it   rained and we did not get to go
Nothing new or   interesting here I tell to thee I believe in private annals   and of public events the newspaper will inform –  John   Randolp of Roanoke died day before yesterday at the City   Hotel
Give my best love to brother Henry and the children   I shall be glad to see you home again returning with renewed   health and spirits – that it may be so in the ardent wish of   thy affectionate sister –

Weston 6.th mo. 17th 1806.
Dear Mother.
I cannot express my feelings, when I first read thy letter.  To lose two such near, and beloved, relations, so near the same time, and also to see the danger, our dear cousins Henry, and Arthur, have escaped.  I feel, I scarcely know how.  I feel, very unhappy.  I hope you will not refuse, to let us come home soon.  We have but 11 days to stay before our time is up.  I promise I will not be running about the streets as thou has mentioned in thy letter.  I will stay with you, read to you, and promise I will do all I can to make you happy as I know thou and Father must undergo a great deal of anxiety on account of our dear uncle and cousins.  I wonder why you did not inform us of grandmoth-er's illness or perhaps she was taken very unexpecdedly. I am ashamed to say, I know very little about the eclipse.  All that I know is that is occasioned by the passing of the moon between the sun and the earth and that part of the sun that the moon passes over appears dark to us. Please to give my love to Dear Father and uncle and cousin John Thomas. 
 From thy affectionate and loving son

Dear Ed, Got thy cousin Thomas letter [for] 6th days mail - Suppose the credit of it is due to him not to thee - Therefore thee will not have looked towards getting an answer That was rather an awkward sort of a business wh. Joseph & Jonathan enlisted in where they undertook the Italian Opera I guess Joseph thought it did not operate very well- & he must have felt decidedly the most awkward of the actors. Well, for you was it, that the charge this time happened to be false. For I greatly fear me that some of you, at some other times, have not been overly scrupulous about such transgressions. - So for this consideration let us try & be lenient to the poor Professor remembering that poor human nature is apt to err. & if you are only innocent it will not trouble you much.
Wish regard to my coming down! (every body has to "come down" She knows & as you all seem to be trying to brings me down, I shall not wonder at finding myself fallen in among you some of these days. If they dont get well before Geo.gets ready to start - I shall think it incumbent upon me to go with him. (I do want them to keep very sick on my acct only a very little will be enough) for me to come on, as I have been on the look out for some excuse this Great while. (Don't for pity's sake think that's earnest.) I was sorry enough to hear how really sick poor Harry had been & I feel right anxious to know how he is. If thee hears from them wont thee let us know. It will be sad if they shd all get the measles together as Julia anticipates.
I wrote to thee so lately that I do not seem to have much on my mind just at present. "The storm's rose & the winds blew (blew) might be said of our weather. If I do go down with Geo. I will endeavor to get out to see thee. If I do I've got no time to spend writing to thee that's another thing so adieu adieu [jusqu an remain]". Find out what what means in the French Dic. Thee can tell cousin Thos. I seem to be humble & willing to come down. But this world's a region of certainty - Write at an early period & remember thy ever affec   Sister

Thee will reccollect my dear Brother that when I last saw thee I promised to write to thee in a short time.  Thee will conclude that my short time is a pretty long one but I have been pretty constantly employed since I returned and have not felt in a very letter-writing humour.  I wrote to Caroline about 3 weeks ago and have not yet received an answer I hope thee will prove a better correspondent than she or I shall have but little encouragement to write.  I have begun tolearn french and I like it very much as far as I have gone.  Sister Rachel told me when I was at [Home] that Hannah Bolton had returned from Weston I should be obliged if thee would give my love to her when thee sees her.  Thee desired to know what I was studying.  I am studying, Geography, Grammar, history and spelling and at present how to write a letter worth reading.  Tell sister Rachel I should be pleased to receive a letter from her though I am not willing to risk writing just again but if she will write to me I will endeavour to be more punctual in the answering of her's than I have been of thine.
When thee writes please to tell me how mother is for I believe all ourfamily have forgotten me and therefore I need not look for a letter from any of them.  Tell Alfred I will answer his letter as soon as I possibly can.  mean-while he must wait patiently.  I must now stop for the present as school is just going to close.
Thee desires to know how the swelling is behind my ear I believe it is much the same as it was when I left home.

Schooley's Mountain Aug 17. '42 

Dear Sister Rachel

We had so uneventful a journey, I have been so quiet since our arrival here, that I have scarcely material for a letter. Travellers are expected, I believe, to be particularly entertaining. Now, there is no time when I feel less so. Fatigue, change of air & diet, always for a time, affect my health unfavorably; and then, the turmoil & bustle scatter the little wits I possess. So that, from home, I am an especially stupid correspondent. Still, as you were kind enough to wish to hear from us, and as we exchanged promises about writing, I will not wait for any thing worth saying, --as I may not have it at all, thee knows; -- and my delay may occasion me the disappointment of not receiving here, the speedy return letter from Fourth St, which is to be my reward.-- 

We had quite a pleasant time so far as Trenton, for our first day's exploit. We arrived there about half past five o'clock; and George with our baggage, via. steam-boat and rail-road, very shortly after. In the evening, we made a little visit to Elizabeth Gummere, who lives near the Hotel. They have a fine, large house, in a pleasant part of town, & express themselves, the young folks, most emphatically, pleased with their change of residence. As we were in the immediate neighborhood, we went with Eliza..th, to spend a few minutes with our old friend, Judge Gordon's wife. She looks and seems just the same asI recollect her in the days of my childhood. So it appears that in this bustling life, there are some not easily jostled out of their way. We found the Judge, some years ago, busy with his attempts to sell his map of New Jersey. It still seems a most interesting theme to him; & if we come this way six years hence, I dare say he will even then be ready to speak of its merits & to state that his stock is not yet exhausted.-- Fifth day night brought us within twelve miles of the mountain, and the next day at noon, we reached the end of our journey--and over such roads! I was thinking, perpetually, of the children's song "Here we go up, up, up, & here we go down, down" &c &c. To adopt little Cary's favourite style, the rain had washed such gulleys in the roads, & the stones were so bare, & there were so many of them!-- 
The first two days after we got here, we had three or four showers per day. By way of consolation, we were told, this was a favorable specimen of their weather this season. For the previous ten days, it had rained all the time. "Recorder [Vaux?]" who is here, calls it temperance weather. I wonder if [Espy] is a tee-totaller.--We were beguiled , when we first came, into taking a room in "the cottage" Its superior dimensions, privacy &c were warmly insisted upon. And as we like plenty of room, and don't like much noise, we thought it quite a prize. The sun shone so flatteringly upon the [compact?], that we never thought of the inconvenience of being drenched in going to our meals, or having them drenched  in being brought to us. As we have now had ample opportunity of trying it both ways, and don't relisheither, we begin to murmer. Coming in search of Health, we fancy too, that a sleeping apartment on the ground floor is not exactly the place to meet with her ladyship, this damp summer. We have some of the inconvenient "[Fine-ear]" family, moreover, next us, who have been very near getting us into a scrape. A grand-daughter of John Jacob Astor has been stoping with a Mr Kane, from Albany, and, under what her friends consider, very aggravated circumstances. They came here to spend the Honey moon, & unfortunately, were placed in the room adjoining ours. Job related to me, one day, in a confidential tone of voice, the history of their flight, as just detailed to him by Governor Coles. This they contrived to over-hear, & being displeased thereat, they imagined a series of questions and answers,-- Job & I being the speakers,-- about the pedigree, personal consequence &c of many of the boarders, which they carried directly to the individuals about whom we were said to be so curious, & from there, they came immediately back to us. Happily, they fixed upon people whom we knew perfectly well, & thus the absurdity of our asking who they were whom we had known all our lives, was sufficiently apparent, & created only a little merriment. But we were somewhat annoyed until we discovered the full extent of this eaves-dropping. Thus, the storms without, & the treachery within doors, have given us a thorough distaste to this part of the premises. Besides, there is more of a crowd than we wished to get into, & if the company does not diminish, we shall want to try some quieter region. Direct, here, however, as we shall leave instructions for letters tobe sent to us. -- We have had it very warm & almost clear now for a couple of days, & have been enjoying it by driving about. The country is sufficiently beautiful to render the slow climbing of hills by no means a tedious affair. The roads are kept in quite tolerable order, & occasionally, we come to a level piece of ground where we trot away quite merrily. People tell us wonders about the flush gained and the disease lost among these hills. I hope our cases may add to a reputation, so richly earned, according to all accounts. -- I should write to Caroline, but I am not a very disinterested letter writer; sowing only where I may hope to reap, --& I fear she is scarcely yet at home.--I should like much, to know how you all are, where you now are, & where you are to be for he next few weeks.--Does thee know where Father & Mother are & when Cara returns? When do you go to Susquehanna [---] & how are Anne's eyes? Tell her I have not seen a single cat since I left home; but we have plenty of little ducks & chickens, the feeding of which is a daily source of amusement to the children. I heard them complaining this morning, that the older ladies were interfering with this, their peculiar privilege. Indeed the belles and beaux seem to find it quite as entertaining as they--remember, my dear R, that thee is bound to procure me a letter, in some way. Either from under thy own hand, (how is it?) or from one of those to whom thee can say "do this & he doeth it." If thee is not well enough, I shall calculate a little, too, on the affection & kindness of my nephews & niece. I do not know whether it will be any thing of a bribe-but I always make it a point to answer letters addressed to me--some time or other. If I should not

My dear father

To prevent any anxiety which you may feel on our account, I embrace the first opportunity which offers since our arrival to inform you of our welfare.  We arrived at Newcastle on 6th day evening about 7, supped there, went on board the packet-boat at 10 & got under way about two in the morning.  During the day the wind was light & generally ahead.  At twelve last night we were within four miles of this, when the appearance of the weather indicating a squall, we were obliged to come to anchor.  We had a pretty severe thunder-storm from the n. [--] but not accompanied with much wind.  It was however, sufficient to alarm our [-------] a good deal & make them all very sick.  William & one other gentleman had a slight attack which sent them on deck; the rest of us experienced no inconvenience.  The storm did not continue much more than an hour, & by five this morning we anchored within half a mile of our landing place.  A boat immediately put out to us & conveyed us safely to shore, under a pretty high swell.  Four miles riding in carriages brought us here an hour before breakfast.
We found the house nearest the water completely occupied.We have taken lodgings in much the best home in the place at the distance of something better than a square from the shore.  I have walked it once & tho' farther than I should like I hope it will answer.  My knees are no worse, but having returning from my first bathing I can say nothing as to the effect of sea-water.
I send this by my friend Wm. W. Austin who sails tomorrow morning with the packet.  We both [-----] our love to all the family.  You will either see us or hear from us again at the end of the week.

Cape May August 2nd 1816

My dear brother

I wrote father on the day of our arrival by Wm. Austin, and mentioned that if we did return I should write again by the end of the week.  Although as respects the article of pleasure I am entirely satisfied, yet I have concluded it would be prudent for me to remain a few days, perhaps a week, longer.    The party I came down with, all return tomorrow; should I return with them, I shall have been here but six days & have bathed but five times.  This can hardly be called giving the water a fair trial.  Thus far I do not know that I have received any benefit; some of our boarders tell me they think I walk better, but I am myself sensible of no change.  We board much farther from the surf than is agreeable to me, but it was impossible to procure quarters in the home nearest the shore.  On the whole I do not much regret it, as our accommodations are much better than can be had in the other houses.
The party we attached ourselves to, engaged a large room with a bed for each and a stipulation that while we occupied it no others should be admitted.  This party consists of Merritt Canby, Jos. Askers, Ellis Yarnall, Robert Barnes, (a brother to the doctor) Richard Nixon a young englishman, and a very clever fellow & our two selves.  When they are gone we shall shift our quarters into a small apartment.  With respect to the employment of our time, it is sufficiently monotonous, and I fear next week will be still duller.  This however applies to myself.  Those who are well find employment enough in gunning, fishing, walking &c.  I was one of a fishing party to-day, which as it will form  one of the most memorable events of my excursion, deserves to be noted.  The packet boat, General Jackson has a day to spare here on each trip, & to-day she engaged to take as many as chose to go, out to the banks to catch sea-bass.  A more delightful day for the excursion could hardly be conceived.  It was neither too hot, too cold, too windy, nor too calm.  We were unfortunate in but one particular, and that a main one.  We found no fish.  I was among the most fortunate and caught three.  One whole stock amounted to about four dozen.  At our greatest distance we were nearly out of sight of land; our fishing place was near twenty miles from shore.  William was afraid to go for fear of sea sickness.  As all the rest of our party went, and I was fearful he would be sick myself, I did not urge him.  I begin to feel quite sailor like, as respects this said sickness.  I never felt better in my life.  A few of the party were very sickand several others complained.  Jos. [---] was the most severely handled of any person on board; he was really ill.  The most unpleasant part of our expedition was landing through the surf on our return.  We landed in a whale-boat, which was brought down pretty low in the water, by the weight of her cargo, consisting of twenty-three persons.  We rose safely over the surf till our prow touched the beach, when it broke over the stern, rocked us very much & shocked several.  Jos. {----] had his hat knocked off & was amazingly frightened.

My dearest brother, 
Would thee be willing to buy us a basket of peaches on 7th day morning and send them down by the 2.10 trian marked Francis Stokes borrowings, via Perryville- Hannah craves some very much and Dr. Sappington says she may eat a little. They are not to be had here for love or money. Thee can pay for them out of the money thee has of mine. 
Poor dear H. does not seem to improve much & her spirits have failed, soshe is quite down-hearted. She comes down-stairs in the evening but has not strength and no appetite- & is right wretched. 
I wish thee could come down on 7th day & spend 1st day with us. We would be delighted to see thee & would not keep thee in her room. The maids are improving, Sarah is a sitting up and I think Mary will be able to do so tomorrow. 
Esther returned this afternoon looking well and rosy. She will be a great help & Edith feels quite made up again. 
I don't see any prospect at all of my going toNewport and if there is any one else to take my place I hope you will invite them. When Hannah does get better I think the sea-air would do her a great deal of good and I hope build her up, and I know in your kindness you will set an open door before her. It is a great disappointment to Franky but perhaps he can go with her. It sounds very presumptous in me to write all this but you are always so kind and cordial it is apt to make us ['"fresh"]. 
It grows late & I must stop, with warmest love thy K.5th day morning - Hannah seems weak this morning. we had rather a disturbed night, for a water-spout and the closet leaked & Frank & Esther  & I were [bobbing] round in a very [-----] manner. It reminded me of a our experiences one night when the was down here- 2 1/2 inches of rain fell in less than 2  hours. 
Frank says that very nice peaches can be got at the corner of Market & [Merrick] right near the depot. I don't know how much they will be but I suppose $1.50 or $2.00

Dear Kinsman

I have to   thank thee for again making me the medium of thy bounty to   the "Belfast Ladies "Relief Association for Connaught".  I   sent the Fifty Pounds on receipt to my friend Mary Murphy,   and have the enclosed acknowledgment from her son.  In a few   days I hope to receive from her some particulars of the   present condition of the Association, and some statistics of   the trade in sewed muslin, which is now a very important   branch of Irish manufacture, and to which their labor   largely contributed.

Since receiving thy letter, I   have (in common with many others here) received a painful   shock, by the sudden & unexpected death of my co-secretary   to the Releif Com–& very dear friend Joseph Bewley.  He had   been unwell some weeks since, but was much better, and had   gone, with his son and two daughters, to spend a few days at   Newcastle, a bathing place in the Co. of Down, hopeing that   the quietude & country air would restore his usual strength.   They were there only two days, and on the third he was   walking with hisfamily in a neighbouring demesne, when he fell suddenly and   life was extinct.  Up to the moment of his fall he appeared   to be perfectly well, and in good spirits, and seemed to   take much enjoyment in the scenery around them.

In   him our Society in this land has lost its most conspicuous &   active member, on whom a heavy burden often lay as respects   the care of its temporal as well as spiritual concerns, and   his immediate friends have lost a kind and liberal friend,   whose sympathising advice and assistance was always ready   for those who needed it.

His loss will be much felt,   and by many to whose necessities he administered   liberally.

His death took place on second day the   15th [----]

My Father and the other members of our   immediate family are well.  My brother William enjoys good   health, but has become increasingly deaf, which is a severe   trial to him.  I hope thy health is good.

I remain   thine affectionately

A Bell and   Co have not yet sent me the papers, but no doubt they will   do so.

My Dear Annie

I have   been very sorry to see day after day passing away without   any acknowledgment sent of thy very interesting &  welcome   lettter, which was a real treat to me. I wish there was some   hope of thy getting as good a one in reply but what with   colds & headache the little wit I ever had seems to have   departed, for which loss I console with my corespondents   every time one of my stupid effusions goes to the Post   Office.- I think a visit from thee & Clemmy would have an   enlivening effect & when summer comes so must you.- It was   very kind to send me that excellent Photo of Uncle Daniel,   after my negligence in the
matter of which I have been duly ashamed- and I am very much   obliged for it.- We had a nice visit to him had we not? If I   had not gone then, I fear I should not have seen him at all-   except that we did meet in the cars the other day- as being   sick in Wilmington entirely spoiled my Germantown visit. so   that I could make none of the calls I hoped to.-
How thee   must have enjoyed having Clemmy so long with thee. You had   splendid times I know. Indeed no one can be at your house   without enjoying themselves- At least that is my   experience.-
Thee knows perhaps that I have been a good   deal with my friend Lizzie Howell this winter.- Her mothers   death was so very sudden- only sickda little more that half   & hour- that the shock was fearful & Lizzie

was a long time recovering from it.- She is yet very sad-   and her brother being in poor health adds to the feeling.-   She was so sick for some weeks as rarely to get down stairs.   nervous & weak- but is now stronger & brighter & very busy   she writes me.- It is often a great blessing I think to   those in sorrow to have duties pressing upon them with must   be attended to & so the mind is diverted from its greif and   made to realize that life has yet much in store for them.   –
Did thee know our Georgie has been sent adrift from his   home into the city? We do miss him sadly- but he likes his   situation in a wholesale store in Market St, very well &    perhaps it is the right thing for him.- We hope that he may   be preserved from the temptations that summoned him.- Lizzie   has come home
for yearly meeting week.- We have been looking for aunt   Rachel Howland & her family every day but hear now they are   not coming till next week.-
Has thee been after “Trailing   Arbutus” this spring? [-] and I went the other day &  found   some pale blossoms. but very sweet.- Isnt it delightful to   hunt under the dead leaves for the delicate things- it seems   to make one feel young again fot the time.- Thee asks have I   read “Snow Bound”—Only a little of it &  have not happened   even to see it in a volume. But intend to get it soon if I   can.- The part I read was pleasant, simple &  [s-----] , -   as thee says more understandable than much of the latter day   poetry.- We have been reading “Across the Continent” and I   have indulged dreams of someday seeing the “Yosemite Valley”   if my finances get into sufficiently prosperous conditions   for such a journey.- Don’t thee 
want to go to Europe with the party that starts next month?-   It must be bery pleasant to look forward to & finer still to   experience if all things are fair & no anxieties to follow   you.- Wonder if John Wood &  Lily will go.- John says he   wants to & I guess Lily would not object.- I liked John   better than I expected to- but he is certainly neither   handsome nor dignified- but [-------] & kind hearted. I   should think.- Is’nt it a comfort Mary Ann Morris is so much   better? I cannot help hoping she will be entirely herself   again before very long.- Their house is very bright &   pleasant & I should think they might be very happy there-   This to be sure happiness is not a thing of outward   circumstances [----]Did thee remember that yesterday was the anniversary of our   dear Presidents death? Wonder where another year will find   us.- What do thy brothers think of our prospects with such a   man as Johnson at the helm.- It is a comfort that the crew   of out ship of State are so staunch & true.-
Suppose   Marry Emma Stokes passed meeting last third day- I do like   Alexander Wood very much. He seems so open & honest.- Will   they have a wedding  I wonder- or just be married & go   travelling.- I hear friends at Arch Street did not accept   Sue Farnum’s resignation. Had she violated discipline before   presenting it? The usual yearly mtg storms seems to be   brewing this evening- but I hope it wont come this.- Does   thee go in and out every day?.- Please excuse this [prosy]   sheet dear Annie & write very soon.- My love please to thy   sister E. – Very loving by thine

My   dear Lilly.

It is good of thee to spare us a copy of   the last reading group, & we [mark] thee very warmly. It is   a great interest to be able to picture such occasions so   much filled in with the dramatic personae, though as this   says, this may not show most of the of the [ladies] to the   best advantage- I should however have thought it was not bad   of Mrs. Morris, whom I once saw, years ago, & who is, as   [----] [----] a sweet  
looking little lady- I wonder if the lady at the back is   Miss [Mc] Vicar? She & his brother were once at Sunny-side,   many, many years ago, such a heart, bright woman I remember.   
It is ever so good to think of Ellie's & thy bliss in   being again together, & what an interest to thee, in seeing   the new home & new life generally! I do hope everything may   have favored the place, & that you may have had a perfect   time in every way. That southern life must be so utterly   different, & I always 

imagine it must be very much as if in another county   altogether with a separate race to deal with- but a country   with great charm about it for the matter of fact Anglo Saxo   n mind. 
We have not heard anything of "Frank & Evelyn"   for sometime, but hope that all is going well with them.   
Our own life has been rather circumscribed the last two   or three weeks, & we have been quite absorbed in our own   small affairs. One of our maids, a sort of family pivot upon   which everything hinges & revolves, has had a very bad   throat for three weeks, & though at first the doctor thought   it was a [------] [------], it has now turned out a 
case of diphtheria. At the same time Sallie was also in bed   with severe cold & an absess in her face, so that we felt   rather a crippled household. Happily S. is quite herself   again, and our maid is steadily improving, but the serious   nature of the illness makes it necessary to take all kinds   of precautions, & we are quite tabooed by our neighbors,   naturally. But we hope there may be no other case, though   the [obscureness] of the attack at first so disarmed our   suspicion we were all more or less in contact for ten days!   
I expect you, like ourselves our watching anxiously lest   this terrible war cloud bursts in the East! It seems almost   the irony of fate that the poor Russian Czar should be freed   into it, in spite of all his Peace Congress agitations. And   one shudders to think of all it may involve before it is   over! Sallie joins in much love, dear Lilly with mine thy   very affect. H. Simpson
I enclose a wee reminder of thy   old friends.

      I rec'd thine & Chellie’s letters to day, when Tho's came out from town.  They also had one from Mary, and we are glad to hear of your safe arrival at Snow Shoe and very thankful I am, that you had a doctor so near at hand to extract the bone from thy throat.  I read thy letter first, and was much alarmed. before knowing what the accident thee alluded to was, but Thomas fortunately knew about it from Mary's letter & told me at once.  What a providential thing it was, that there was a Dr. so near at hand.  the children must have been very much frightened, before thee was relieved.--I hope thee will be careful of thyself, and not jump, and injure thy arch again.—
      -
      attached wife Anna S. Cope.  I hope Tom is provided with warm under-clothing.  Mary sends her love & hopes you will have a good time.I hope thee has enough warm clothing, with thee, for I sh'd not be surprised of thr warmest weather is past.  We are having it delightful here at home, the thermometer 68 this morning at 8 o'clock and under 80 at noon.  This afternoon Thomas & Elizabeth Mary & I called at father's, and afterwards at Ellis Yarnall's leaving Mary at father's.  We found them all at home, and had a very pleasant visit.  Lucy Harrison is very bright & agreeable & Anne is lovely.  She told me she had written a note to Lillie, which I would send to her when it comes to hand.  She also told me she was sorry not to go to Snow Shoe with you, but they could not go to Chicago, & as their time is so limited they of course felt anxious to see as much as possible before going home.  they expect to go to Detroit from Chicagoand then on to Niagara.  They expect to leave sometime next week, and take the journey alone.  We all disapprove of them taking such a long journey by themselves, but I suppose Ellis Yarnall will find out some one to look after them.  When they go on, they expect to spend the first night at Altoona, and then travel day & night until they reach Chicago.  I have sent Lillie & Chellie some under-clothing.  2 flannel skirts, 2 under vests, 1 cloth body, 2 pairs thick stockings, 1 pair drawers, 1 [Alpaca?] skirt.  Anna & Carrie are quite well, & the former is invitee to spend tomorrow with cousin Mary [W.?] Brown's little Mary.  I did not [?] like [?]-ing her just now, but could not well decline.  I was at father's this afternoon, and they were all pretty well.  father seems stronger from the change in weather.  I saw bro. John and his boys go off this morning, and hope they had apleasant trip to Altoona.  I am glad you met with such a polite reception at Bellefonte.  I had no idea before, that there was any such spring of water, there as mentions.  63000 gallons a minute is immense.  I think you must have enjoyed the ride up the mountain very much, if the views are so beautiful.  Give my love to Lillie & Chellie, and tell them I hope they will not be put out at my sending them some warm clothing, as I am only sorry they did not send for warm dresses too, as they have nothing warm with them.  It is now bed-time and I must put by my writing; the children are enjoying Anna Hartshorne's company very much.  I hope some of you will write tho' I do not want you to tax yourselves.  I have already been much favored.  Bro Thomas intended sending sister Anne's letter, but it was not returned from Aunt Ruth's in time.  with much love to you all, ever thy

      Frank has been writing to William this morning, and has most likely advised you on all points of interest.- you probably know by this time, that we are all in a good state of health, and we hope that our sister Susan is improving, tho' she still has some head-ache.  Frank & cousin Wistar are very kind and devote themselves almost exclusively to contributing to her comfort & pleasure in every way.  F is devoted to Susan and does evey thing in his power to promote the improvement of her health, his kindness is unparalleled: everything is done for us, and we have nothing to do, but join in the pleasant plans laid out for us.- Elizy H & Susan were concluding before dinner, that they accomplished very little of any thing on account of the time occupied in changing their dresses for the different labors of the day.- About ten in the morning they prepare for bathing or rather we do when Susan does not go-
      /
      not arrive on 7th day tho' we intend to do so if possible.  the Boat did not leave until 5 o'clock this morning.  I expect the irregular lately.- with much love

      she is resting since her bath.then return about 12 o'clock.  rest, until time to away for dinner, then about 5 o'clock, a different costume must necessarily be adapted for Sailing especially when the boats, are slightly fishy & a little dirty.- then we come home about ten-time or little past, and another change must be made to appear at [---] which [---] will suffice for the evening.- but all this is done in a good hurry and I cannot say it consumes much time.- I believe I have nothing new to tell thee, and indeed, I expect it would be very puzzling to think of any such thing when Cousin Wistar is of the party, for he writes home to frequently, and describes every thing that seems with so much minuteness, that if you are favored with the perusal of his epistles, ours must seem quite commonplace; this is my conjecture, as we joke Wistar & Sue both, about writing so often.- Only to think- Sixth day evening we leave, if a storm or fog does not prevent us, and Tom has concluded to remain, and return with us last evening tho' fog was so dense that the Bay-State" did not go out, and now we have every prospect, of the same thick state of the atmosphere for this evening consequently.  it seemed hardly worth while for Tom to leave before we did.- The Massachusetts arrived here with Mr. Williams on board, about 11 o'clock thismorning having been lying off Point Judith, even since four o'clock.  Susan & Lizzie went to bathe this morning with F & Wistar leaving me at home to pass the time as I could.  Tom & Moses had gone fishing, and I was quiet enough.  Susan though it best notwithstanding your message, to try the [---] three times faithfully as the Dr directed, and I hope she will not be any worse for it, and perhaps it may strengthen her afterwards.  She says she likes it very much while in the water, but she feels pretty weak for sometime afterwards.  we think she is the best judge for what is best for her, and she does exactly what she wished in the Bathing line; Frank takes her in, giving her three waves as directed, he said the water was very warm & pleasant this morning.  I quite long to go in again but fear I shall not have an opportunity of going more than once or twice more before I leave.- It suits Elizy Hacker exactly, she feels a little tired after coming out, but it seems to brance & strenghthen her, and shee looks better I think in this little time of our [---] here.  I do hope her father will telegraph her to remain with Sue, if the letter does not arrive in time to answer it before our leave.- yester afternoon we were out Sailing in the bay, landed on one of the [dumpling?] rocks gathered some sprigs of green to press, and enjoyedthe novelty of it highly, it was really very pleasant, altho' by the time we returned, our blanket shawls were almost white with the fog.  Sailing seems to suit Susan, very well, but I think clear weather as a general thing is preferable to her.- This afternoon we think of calling at fr'd Hazard’s, we spent a pleasant evening there last Sixth day.  they are certainly a delightful family. Ann[a/e?] Hazard called here this morning with S & A Jenkins who are still staying with them – we intend riding out to see fr'd Jenkins before we go.- 4th day morn.  I was obliged to leave this shut hastily yesterday afternoon, as Thomas Hazard & his wife called upon us inviting us to spend this afternoon with them which we intend doing.  Elizy & Frank are much disappointed I believe in Fanny H’s beauty, but they must see her at [---] before they fully decide.  She is perfect at home.- my love to all- Susan and Lizzie are taking a nap before dinner, and I cannot disturb them now.- there is a thick fog over they bay now 12 at noon, and it will [---] increase- Tom could not have gone last night in consequence of the bay as the boat did not leave, and perhaps it is as well for him to wait for us.  Frank & myself do not think it proper to leave here in a fog or storm and Tom must not think it strange if we do

   Dear sister Anna
   
   Thee will think I am very remiss in performing my promises but it is useless for me to make excuses, as thee knows how time goes with me, generally, amongst the childrenm during the day, and by evening thee may imagine how it is that I feel too indolent to write a letter.  We are much obliged to father for his kind & sympathetic letter at this time and I hope we may be enabled to take the right view of our troubles, in this matter.  Much love to father and mother, and tell them that Francis keeps up his spirits very well, considering all things, he has received a letter from bro' Thomas to day, with Geo. M. Dallas reply to his (Tho's) epistle, which he hasprobably sent to Atlantic City for father's perusal.- it is short, very politely worded, and caps the climax for coolness, on the subject, as he had evidently not troubled himself about the affair in the slightest degree.- I must confess, I was completely taken aback at such cool indifference on the subject, especially as Thomas had consulted him before, when in England.  But I suppose there is nothing more to be done about it, and we must try to hear it with a Christian spirit as father does.-
   Elizy sends her love to you all & is in better spirits, than lately, as she has received several letters from Thomas, he is still in Brussels, and appears to have no very definite idea when he may return home.-
   We are glad father has sent for Julia to join you, as she needs a change, I fear she confines too lately to the attic, and a little of your refreshing sea-breezes will revive her.  I think she has been concerned about George, as he hasbeen quite indisposed.  He is now much better and spent this afternoon here for the first time, as the Dr. thought the ride might do him good, but unfortunately he did not see much of Julia, she having been in town, and did not reach home until near seven o'clock when he was obliged to go home to tea.  He says the Dr. pronounced his lungs quite clear now, and I hope he will be able to accompany Julia to the shore.- Hannah Stokes has been here to day, and intends staying over-night, it is quite cheering to have a little company as we miss you all so much.  Thy letter this afternoon was very acceptable, and tell Clemmy I thought perhaps she would have favored us again.  I am glad to hear of the Doctor having slept better and hope he may be benefitted, my love to sister Mary, and mention to her if thee pleases, that I have not received any reply to my letter to her, but suppose I am to get a bonnet for her at Jones' according to my best judgment.  but they think it is very doubtful if they can procure any other quality of [---].  it is not as fine as thatof which our sun-bonnets are made.  Elizy Hacker expected to have gone down to Atlantic City this week, but was not well enough.-
   Brother John has been here a few minutes this evening, Rueben is not entirely well of the poison yet, and they think he has the whooping-cough.  Our Willy has it now, also little Johnny & little Mary has it quite badly.-
   Our Tom is getting better of it, and Alfred does not cough now at all; Henry still coughs a good deal at night, as well as little Johnny.-
   Mary Mayer has arrived in the city of P- and will come down here tomorrow afternoon.  How does sister Mary enjoy herself, and has she returned to bathe?  Tell Clemmy I was not surprised to hear her opinion that it is not equal to Newport.  Sarah Biddle mentioned to us on first day last, of their having received letters from uncle Alfred and aunt Rebecca- and uncle Alfred is much better, thinks the hydropathic system suits him.  Bishop Potter’s family are still with them.  Thee does not know, how much I wished she had offered to show usthe letters, as she said they were long, and very interesting.
   It is past ten o'clock, and F- is shutting up the house affectionately thy sister

   My dear sister
   
   When I last wrote, it seemed so doubtful whether thee would be at uncle William's or on the way home with Edward Biddle, that I concluded to direct the letter to Clemmy in case thee had left there.- Brother Thomas returned home very unexpectedly on second day evening, the very time we were looking for thee, he was much overcome by the voyage, and the anxiety of getting off in a steamer, but I hope is better now,and likely to improve; his strength has been much prostrated, and he has had some fever but the Doctor considers him better this evening, and he does really seem better, tho’ he is still quite weak.  They had a very cold voyage, and he could not keep warm enough & consequently took a severe cold, but thee must not be anxious or uneasy about him, as Dr Rhoads thinks him much better; &he is entirely free of fever this evening.  Alfred is also much better to day for the first time, but he has changed so frequently from better to worse in the course of twenty four hours, that we hardly know how to calculate about him.  But I think the Doctor is more encouraged about him this evening, and I have great hopes that he will soon be on the well list, as he has one tooth through, and he has not coughed quite so hard to day; the rest of the family are all pretty well, father, and mother desire their love to thee, and say thee had better take the first good opportunity to return home, and not to think of coming home alone, without hearing further from us; and Francis also adds that in case Alfred continues better, perhaps he can come up for the next week.-
   With regard to thy medicine, and salve, we will endeavor to send it to thee in some way, as well as the material for aunt Susan’s duster.- Bro' Thomas has bough various little articles for the children, with which they are much pleased; he bought Lilly & Chelly eacha suit of doll’s clothes made in Paris, according to the present style, hats shoes, and even night-gown and cap.  velvet [---] watch & chain, little [---] all furnished in the most minute style, [---], &c little beauties,- the children are so overjoyed, that they show them to everyone that comes, and do not get tired of examining them, at all times in the day, and I do not wonder for they are so elegantly made that you cannot help admiring them.  Sister Elizy and Julia sed their love to Clemmy and thyself, in which I wish to join, also love to Aunt Susan, Annette & Carry- I am sorry I have no news to tell thee, such as thee would like to hear, but as I have not been any where for the last three or four weeks thee must not wonder at it.-

As Dr Rhoads very kindly offered to take this note to thee, I thought perhaps thee would like to hear how thy little brothers are getting along at home and therefore take the opportunity to send a few hasty lines.  Alfred was very happy in a few minutes after papa and Willy & Tom left us; I went to ride with uncle Thomas the latter part of the afternoon, and took him along, we had a few errands to do in Germantown.-
Uncle Alfred & Aunt Rebecca Cope with Annie, called to see us yesterday afternoon and we had a very pleasant visit from them.  Uncle Alfred's knee is still rather troublesome, but his foot is better.  Cousin Edward is going to the WhiteMountains with uncle Edward Yarnall & Aunt Caroline, very soon.  Tell Aunt Lizzie that I saw grandma Brown at meeting this morning, she told me they were all pretty well except Ridgely and he was threatened with [cramp?] last night, but was much better to day, indeed quite relieved; they sent for Dr Rhoads who saw him again this morning before grandma came to meeting.  Tell papa that wonders will never cease, Aunt Mary Haines & mamma are going to spend this evening with Ann Haines to meet B Yarnall's family.-

Title: 1875 July 4, Lake Windermere, to Tom & Scrubby

Lockwood Hotel   Lake Windermere
   July 4. 1875
   
   Dear Tom & Scrubby.
   
   I did write a few lones to thee Scrubby from Kendal but I rec'd such a nice letter from thee last Fifth day that I concluded to send thee a longer one; & as I have already rec'd two letters from Tom I thought it would be well to kill two birds with one stone-so here goes-We saw the first of this lake last Fourth day afternoonand will continue to see it till sometime tomorrow.  I haven't the slightest idea where the picture, at the head of this sheet, is taken from;- but I know one thing & that is that I have not as yet seen anything like it nor do I think that there is such a view.  At any rate it gives you no idea of the place.  Now for the narrative- We took a row on the lake soon after arriving here & on Fifth day took the steamer down to [Bowness?] where we expected to get on a carriage & drive over to Coniston.  When we arrived there, however, the sky looked so threatening & Alexis not feeling very well we concluded to leave it till next day, & returned to Louwood.  Arriving in a heavy shower we were at a loss to know what to do, till I decided to go over to Keswick & get our letters that were probably awaiting our arrival there.  So as the stage did not go till 3 o'clock I drove over to Ambleside, bought a full rubbersuit (coat leggings & cap) hired a horse & started off, about 1 o'clock.  You can imagine me clothed in these things sitting on an awfully rough trotter nothing of my usual self being visible except my eyes, nose & mouth, and my shoes.  The suit answered admirably, keeping me perfectly dry in the hardest thunder-storm I was ever out in- Except my shoes wh. in a few minutes were rather soggy.  However it was soon over & I arrived at [Derwentwater?] Hotel, [Portinscale?] at 4 P.M. having ridden on horseback 19 miles.  Here I obtained, first a lunch then the letters, one from each of you.  While waiting here another gust came up & when it had gone over the sky looked brighter & more settled.  So having engaged rooms for 2nd day, at 6 P.M. I set off & had a most beautiful ride past [Thirlmue?] & Helvellyn, Grasmere & Rydal Water back to Ambleside wh. I reached at half past eight.  Drove downto our hotel, took some red-hot tea & then went out to hunt for Lilly & Alexis, whom I found spooning in a bench & who told me that there were three other pairs in the hotel worse off than we were.  Sixth-day we set off for Coniston Water, driving alongside of Windermere & crossing below Bowness, through Hawkshead where Wordsworth went to school & finally reached Coniston where Lillie & I made the tour of the lake in the steam Gondolee as they call it while Alexis ascended the "Old Man."  We had the best of it for, although he immortalized himself by leaving his name & address in full on top of pole of stones which has been placed there, yet he was caught in such a dense fogthat he couldn't see anything & in turn caught a species of chill & fever, from which he is slowly recovering.  Yetserday we went through Grasmere & Rydal & got Lillie pretty well played out.  We rowed down Grasmere Lake & walked to Rydal Mount, (wh we did not see, exceptone window & the chimney's) Lillie & Alexis "preferring rather" to keep on a level while I crossed over the hill from wh. I got an elegant view of Windermere, Rydal Water, Grasmere & [Tharlmere?] besides some small 'towns' and the mountains on all sides.  On coming down I overtook Lou & Alexis spooning by the roadside, On my coming up they had began to talkpleasantly about the weather, Lillie suggesting that it was much cooler than the 3rd of July 2 years ago, at wh. both looked remarkably pleased & mysterious.  I looked very innocent but on making "comparative mathematical calculations" have concluded that it must have been that day they drove over from Connymeade together & took two hours & a half (2 ½ hrs) by the watch to get up to the house from the stable-   

   It’s fearfully hard to get Lillie up in the mornings.  She grumbles incessently because Alexis & myself will order breakfast at half past eight & uses as anargument to the statement, (I wont say in fact) that Father when he was over here did not breakfast till nine.  Another instance, Tom of the force of example.  However we dont give in & in revenge she gener-ally keeps us waiting 15 or 20 minutes.  Alexis thinks it is a good thing that we travel from place to place, as they must think wherever we go that it is a mere accident that we are late.  This miserable climate dont seem to suit me very well.  In the first place the voyage knocked me, clean; for I caught cold some how wh. increased my sore-throat & I haven’t got rid of it yet.  It steadily increased till I got to Warwick wh place seemed to agree with it; for it has been improving since.  Then I had a boil on my skin which troubled me not a little when I ran against anything or Alexis hit me with his umbrella.  I have got it down to a pretty fine point now however & one is coming on my backjust between my shoulders so as to afford me an opportunity of displaying my skill in twisting my arms around.  Beer dont seem to be the thing for me at present, & I have hardly tasted it since leaving Liverpool.  As to the roast-beef, it tastes very much like the same article at home, and they put so much mint with the peas to make them green I suppose that you cant taste any thing else.  But the great charm is that every thing is so nice & clean- no greasy knives &c  You must excuse this writing; but Lillie brought us out here on a most uncomfortable hill-side & insists on sticking it out.  We saw some very pretty little ponies when we were in Wales Srubby; but as we are carrying very small valises & they are pretty full we thought best to defer our purchasefor a season.  I commenced writing on this sheet as you may see but Lou thought it was so important to write on pictured paper that I gave in- Consequently the above marks- I hope that Hazen may succeed in getting up his party & also that he will not ruin the horses driving too much in the park.  I have just thought of a little map wh. I have in my packet wh. I shall enclose in this letter with 5th and 6th sdays excursions marked on them.  Although it may not interest either of you I think mother will like to see it.  I will now cook as it is time for me to be poking Lillie up to go down to dinner,

This morning just as we were finishing breakfast she commenced raising her elbows to the same level as her shoulders (You probably remember that little habit) but I saw it in time & proposed to up to our rooms to stretch.

   My poor dear blue Brother
   
   Sister E has just bee reading thy letter to Chelle dated Woodford 9 mo 8th and I am very sorry thee gets so down in the mouth, and could wish I had been along with thee- provided I was wanted and could have done thee good, not that I would place myself before some others Lilly, Chellie, &c, but then maybe thee would not have felt me so much on thy mind, as I think I should have been pretty easily contented even if I did have to stay pretty close by old London.  I would have at least been a "flesh & blood" companionand not one of the ancient curiosities the guide books introduce thee to.  Not to say how much I would have liked to have been along on my own account, and the many little bits of intruction I would have picked up by the way, Well!  not wishing to assume too much I thought maybe I would have been better than nobody.  But when it came to paying call on the Hartshornes and the like, thee might have left me behind, the grandees and I, I fear would not get along very well together, some of them at any rate.
   
   Well would thee like to know what we are about at home.  Brother T at present in scouring vigorously at our new plate glass windows which have justbeen inserted into our front door, sister E has settled down to reading after one of her daddy long-leg excitements, whilst the children are settling off to bed except Ellie, whom Lilly got to come down to your house to tea, Chellie being over at her Grandfathers, while Alfred, and Frank took tea with us, Here they come Lilly, Virginia and Dr Hartshorne as escort, Perhaps thee will scarcely think it worth while for me to write all this.  Sister Anna seems to be consulting various books, following thee in thy travels, she was showing me a picture of- let me see- the old wall of Portsmouth, which thee speaks of in one of thy letters, and this evening she is inquiring for "Old England."  Yesterdaybrother J and wife, with myself took an early start for Wilmington, to pay one of those stated visits to Hannah Richardson.  It was a lovely day and we had a very nice time, and thyself and thy movements were among other topics spoken of.  In the cars that morning I had quite a little talk with James Cox, who also was inquiring after thee, and though absent thou art not forgotten.  I do hope thee found Ellis Yarnall and party on the Continent- and has enjoyed thy trip, and hope it will do thee good, I really fear thee will not get near all the good of the trip we would like, when thee gets so worried, try to look beyond the present difficulty, and think perhaps it will come rightin the end, and then thee will be sorry thee had taken so much trouble, and not gathered more good by the way, And even if it dont turn out what you wish, there are so much greater troubles, that I would have thee try to brighten up.  I dont want thee to finish up with typhoid feaver, this sounds most too bad dont it?  But I hope by the time this reaches thee, thee will feel quite brightened up, with thy trip on the Continent &c.
   
   5th day the 26th.  There has been quite a gap in my letter, the time being taken up in various ways, This morning was meeting morning and a very interesting meeting I thought it, S Emlen addressing the children, and in the course ofhis discourse told an interesting incident relating to a little girl who died lately, and who I suppose was little Mary Rhoads, Charles Rhoads daughter.  I suppose sister Anna told thee of her death, she was only sick 24 hours, and taken insensible almost from the first I believe.  Mary Haines spoke of her as having been a child of the Saviour for a year past.  Samuel Morris followed S.E. in a solemn prayer for the "parents", I think we sometimes have our best meetings on 5th days.  After meeting I went to Aunt Martha's to dine, and have some conversation with her in regard to Eugenia & Samuel, who are now here on a visit.  Aunt Constantia is very anxious S should not return to Washington and we think it veryimportant he should not, but be placed at some boarding-school.  Lilly & Chellie have just come up here, & also brother J and sister M.  Chellie's tongue has been going pretty much like a bell clapper ringing for [fire].  -that last word is fire- thy daughter has been joging her old aunt's elbow, which must account for the above appearance.  General Sheridan comes to Germantown to night, Gtn is coming on.  I suppose he will make quite a stir.  And Gough is coming too [---]!  I have tried to write in the fashionable style of crossing the page but alas!  I have not succeeded.  I hope thee can read it.  Sister Mary says give my love to Frank.  What would thee think of seeing her [---] down by the banks of the BrandywineHer visit there seems to have made quite an impression on her, she goes from home so little, and sees so little of the rural, small things make quite an incident in her quiet life, but the Brandywine is pretty fair for all.  I have not told thee yet how much surprised, almost shocked I was by thy letter to me at E-town telling of thy intention of starting for Europe.  it was so utterly unexpected, and then I was so far away from you, and could not ask what thee had gone for, except I knew it was on business, and then I would have liked to have taken a more affectionate farewell of thee, it had been such a hasty one when thee left Elizabethtown.  We had a very nice time there, Clemmie improved very much I thinkthough she has some cough still at times but it was of very little account, if it had not been for her previous attack.  We visited John Brown’s grave amongst other places, and I have some maple sugar for thee from his place.  I hear sister A and Lilly are both writing, but it is impossible to find a time when there is not some one writing to thee.  So should my letter come in at the little end of the horn, may it at least prove to thee that thee is affectionately remembered by thy far distant but loving
    
   sister Ruthanna
   
   If it should come in thy way to procure an Irish [poplin?] dress for me I would be glad to have one, if they are not too very high, dont get it if over $4.00 per ydI send a pattern of the one I have had, a most excellent one, I would like a dark gray or mode shade, but without a blue or pink shadow in it, my present one has blue in it.  or I would like a pretty brown, but dont take any trouble about it- There may be a kind not-quite-so heavy & expensive as this pattern would be

   I little while ago Carry handed me thy letter to read- which was received today, and dated 1 mo 22d and 24th and asked if I would write to thee.  From the tenor of thy letter thee seems to think there has been an improvement is Uncle Wm's condition.  But though for a little while, since being in bed- he was able to take cream again, to some little amount, he is now very low indeed, and taking only a very little wine, about a teaspoonful at a time.  TheDr told them he might not live through last night.  I came over yesterday afternoon.  About 7 O'clk  the girls and Edgar were around his bed.  He was asking about one or two of them; and who it was at the foot of the bed?  when told it was Nettie, said he could’nt see- still I think there was but little light in the room- The remark was made that he had a good many kind children round him, I think he tried hard to say yes- but seemed unable, something like a slight spasm coming on, from that time for a while, it seemed as if he might be dying.  but he again revived, and was able to speak out quite loud during the night.  calling outhis wishes he does not seem able to modulate his voice.  He is very childlike and dependant upon those around him.  How frail we are truly!  Human nature seems to be utter weakness at such times.  He  has been generally & uncomplaining during his sickness, although within a day or two there has been some moaning, apparently from weakness he dont speak as if he suffers much.  He seems very appreciative of the attention of his friends.  I do not think any of them now look for his recovery.  And from present appearances, it does not seem likely the end is very far off and yet I feel as if it was hard to know how long it may be.  He is very very sick looking now.  By dear aunt Susans removal, pooruncle Wm seems of course more thrown upon his children, And it is indeed pleasant to see their kindness & attention.  dear Clemmie especially, [*] but perhaps I should not draw any comparison, but she is the oldest and has felt perhaps more responsibility, especially before her father was confined to bed, and others had stepped in to assist.  The girls seem pretty well and much composed.  Nettie is suffering with headache to day.  and Clemmie was a day or two ago.  Edgar does not look very well to me but he was up a good deal last night.  Alexis seems very well.  Of course thee knows the girls have been passing through a great deal.  but I hope the Lord has been near may an eternal inheritance be granted uncle Wm if he is taken
   
   *more striking with Clemmie than Carry & Nettie, because of her former shrinkingClemmie seemed much distressed and unnerved last evening, when her father seemed to be reviving again, and she had been in hopes it was almost over.  His groaning was distressing  to her.  but I do not know that he was suffering so much.  If it was suffering, I should suppose it was from weakness and distress.  Cousin Frank and Mary Yarnall have been very kind and attentive.  We are expecting brother Thos out to night.  I will now close this biding thee farewell.  I fear this is a very different letter from what it might have been had one of the girls written it.*  Affectionately thy friend

   My dear Alexis & Lillie
   
   Shall your tardy Aunt Anne try to write you a bit of a letter from this substantial land perhaps to meet you in the land of antiquity, art, and beauty.  I cannot describe Pompeii, I cannot say I have been where Paul landed so long, long ago.  Yet give me the land of protestant vigorous American for my home, before stale Itily [sic]!  do you think that very unappreciative?  Do not suppose I think there is nothing of interest there.  There seems to me much of the spirit of this world which you may see when abroad, more than in our more practical land.

Mary Creeth thinks James much improved.  And we may hope his good traits will appear to his advantage.  He took articles of clothing with him belonging to his parents and one or two articles which he took of his fathers I was glad to hear of; it seemed to show an affectionate feeling connected with the old association.

   Shall your tardy Aunt Anne try to write you a bit of a letter from this substantial land perhaps to meet you in the land of antiquity, art, and beauty.  I cannot describe Pompeii, I cannot say I have been where Paul landed so long, long ago.  Yet give me the land of protestant vigorous American for my home, before stale Itily [sic]!  do you think that very unappreciative?  Do not suppose I think there is nothing of interest there.  There seems to me much of the spirit of this world which you may see when abroad, more than in our more practical land.

   It is probable that my son Alfred, who is about embarking for Madeira for the benefit of his health, may visit your country on his return homewards.  Should he do so, I have a desire that he should call on thee.  He would like to be made known to some friends in England, among whom he would prefer to spend his time while among you.  He is an exemplary member of the religious Society of Friends, & I shall feel greatly obliged by any act of kindness & attention which may be shown to him.

   My son Alfred is about to proceed to Madeira, where he designs to spend the winter, for the benefit of his health.  & as he will probably visit England before returning to America, I feel desirous of making thee acquainted with him.  He will of course incline to be principally among friends, while in your Country, & I shall feel much gratified by thy making him known to some of them.  He is an exemplary member of the religious Society of Friends, & will be found worthy of their regard.  I need scarcely add how much I shall be obliged by thy kind attentions to him-

   We have at last my dear son been favoured to hear from thee- thy Letters of the 21st 1mo having reached us 2 days ago- that is one to Henry & one to William.  These are all which have as yet been recd-  Much as all of us have been gratified to learn thy safe arrival at Madeira our pleasure would have been greatly increased to have some assurance of thy health having been improved.  We hope for the best & are thankful to find thou art spending thy time so agreeably- far away from the troubles which surround us on all hands- Our country is indeed in a very portentious condition.  Genl Jackson seems to be determined let the consequences be what they may, to crush the Bank of the United States.  & such is the foolish nay mad devotion of his immediate partizans, that they are as determined to support him, reckless as to the future.  To day we have a message from our Governor, to the Legislature, announcing the failure of his attempts to borrow money.  & labouring to throw the blame on the Bank- besides the injustice of this charge, he appears to be but little aware of the effect this will produce on money lenders at home & abroad.  Who are [---] thy set, & will be alarmed with fears that the state may not be able to pay the interest of its vast debt- Had he posessed the manliness to recommend the recharter of the Bk public confidence would at once have been restored, & with it the facility of borrowing.  He contemplated the stopage of the public works- Who will then be able to calculate the public loss?  There can of course be little or no income, & the works themselves must be injured if not ruined.

   It is growing towards being after sunset, but while Job is making arrangements for our departure tomorrow morning in the Massacheusetts Steamer for Providence, it falls to my lot to drop a line by Wm who is intended send with the Carriage & Horses next day, by return of the same Steamer to NYk thence to proceed on his way to Philada.-  You will all be gratified to hear of thy dear mothers improved health, & also of Eleanors- altho we have experienced hot weather for some days, & have qualms as to the propriety of throwing ourselves into a more heated atmosphere-  Stephen P. Morris arrived here yesterday from Providence, & reports the thermometer to have been up to 95 the day before.  The air since dinner to day has become cooler, & we may reasonably hope will improve a pace shortlty-  Other things change as well as the weather- & now after writing so far, a bell man announces that a Balloon Steamer is to be here tomorrow from P. & return again at 3 AM-  We wished originally to go by her- but she has undergone repairs, & there was this morning no certainty when she wd. be here-  We therefore had made up our minds to go by the Massachusetts between 6 & 7 AM-  We intend to visit N. Bedford, Boston, Wooster &c &c.  & stop at Hartford Ct where letters may meet us on our way home, not later than 10 days from today-
   
   We have visited most of the Lions- & among them the Library, where rest the remains of divers elderly volumes-  The discoveries of the Icelanders are there deposited-  We met in the St a certain antiquarian, named Bull, with whom we held learned converse on those discoveries-  On asking him if he had heard of the learned northener who had found a stone with Runic Characters- a temple, & an image representing the Scandanavian God Thor, in Brazil- He said he had not- & then added, "so long as they confined themselves to N. Am, I was willing to concede that point to them- but now that they are going to claim S. Am too, I wont believe any of it"-  The old man may have read our couplet- "They lose the whole who claim too much
    
   As Simon Snyder said in Dutch- And the Danes may now hang up their fiddle, & content themselves with their own Icy shores-The drives abt.

   While writing Elenor bids me say- you have among you, used her [---] badly, in not even noticing a Letter- wh he took trouble- pains taking man- to endite to some of you- but as she has stepped out- I do not know when manufactured, nor to whom directed- Cara’s epistle of odds & ends- like this of mine- has been received, & was, for her comfort, very satisfactory-
   
   Having in council duly convened decided to go by the Baloon to morrow.  I have come to the conclusion to rest for the present from my labours- to resume if needs be, in the morning but not until I say that we this afternoon paid another visit to the afflicted family mentioned before- none of them are better- the mother indeed much worse- she seems destined we think to take her departure to a better world very soon-

He abounds in anecdote- mostly I suspect the product of his own fancy- His atheism offended Knickerbocker much- it shd. be Knickerbacker- marble baker-  I joked & talked politics with the Judge for a while- but finding when hard pressed he became rude, I quit it- yet shd. be amused with his profundity of discourse could I have faith in his word-  He stated for instance that he had furnished the Bk. US. with the first list of Directors for the branch at Nashville- all of whom "Me. Biddle appointed"- He did not however know that while making this statement to me & others he was addressing a man, who had been not only a Director of the Parent Bank at the time, but chairman of the Cme. of elections, who alone reported all nominations of branch directors, to the Board, & who knew the statement to be untrue-  I did not undeceive him, but left him to the enjoyment of his own fiction.  We had a short visit from a mercht. of Havanna- Cpa!  Clapp of the House of Drake, & Co an intelligent man, who, inter alia, gave me a piece of information entirely new, at least to myself- He says that a company of individuals, Spaniards & others, residents in Cuba have purchased a large tract of sand from a native Prince, in Africa, 150 miles square- wh. is to be cultivated with Coffe Sugar &c for commerce- the natives being the Labourers- should the designs of the Comp.y be honest, & fairly carried out- it will carry out Buxtons Scheme, & prove a great blessing to Africa- but considering of whom the Co. is composed, I cannot avoid fears.  C says the Coffee Plantations in Cuba yield but 6 or 7 Pct. while their Sugar Plantations give them 10- the slaves working 14 hours of the 24- The labour is so severe that when suspended, to take food, he has known the slave to fall asleep while on his feet, & prefer rest, even to eating- the waste of life is consequently great.
   
   The change in the weather has produced its usual effect- my E has a headache but will doubtless be better when the sun advances- by the way we have had but one or two foggy mornings since our arrival-  Job & I mean to experiment on a warm bath this morning deeming the sea air is too fresh for our skins-  Love to all- & sympathy in the bargain for any that have tooth ache or the like-

   As there are so many at Lincolns who have nothing to do, we have half a mind & almost tother half tooto get our dander up for their wicked neglect open in not writing-
   
   I had just sealed this letter when Henry's of the 22d arrived- & have accordingly reopened it to make the acknowledgment- It is gratifying to learn of your continued good condition & of his having parted with his tooth ache- a most troublesome compassion-  I had not heard of any defaltations in the Kent.y Bank- nothing short of making such crimes felony can prevent them-  We have indeed arrived at a such state of morals-  Finding that the next mail goes via Providnce, I shall carry this letter there- & if anything worth penning occur
   
   will make proper not thereof-  We rece.d Franks letter of the 22d recording his & Toms marvellous escape from Hicksite contamination- tho I think they might have broken bread with J.B without fatal consequences-

   Here we are at Providence, after a run of abt. 2 hours from Newport-  We lodge at the City Hotel, a large & apparently well regulated House- we have formed no acquaintences but shall probably see some of our friends during the day- Our run up the Narragansett was not very interesting- the shores presenting little variety-  Bristol, Warren & a few neat villages were in view, but trees, those grand ornaments of nature, & wh. impart so much beauty to rural scenery & to City & Town comfort are sadly wanting-  This morn is bright & cool-  As yet we have formed no plans for the day-  When all are up we will hold a councilThe Town meeting to control the Courts is of bad omen- especially as the Judges are by our new Constitution subject for their offices to the popular will- These doings tend to anarchy and despotism, the fruit of Jacksonism- Fanny Wrightism &c[T.P.C. 8/26- Prove- -]

C says the Coffee Plantations in Cuba yield but 6 or 7 Pct. while their Sugar Plantations give them 10- the slaves working 14 hours of the 24- The labour is so severe that when suspended, to take food, he has known the slave to fall asleep while on his feet, & prefer rest, even to eating- the waste of life is consequently great.
   
   The change in the weather has produced its usual effect- my E has a headache but will doubtless be better when the sun advances- by the way we have had but one or two foggy mornings since our arrival-  Job & I mean to experiment on a warm bath this morning deeming the sea air is too fresh for our skins-  Love to all- & sympathy in the bargain for any that have tooth ache or the like-
   Thos. P. Cope
   
   As there are so many at Lincolns who have nothing to do, we have half a mind & almost tother half tooto get our dander up for their wicked neglect open in not writing-
   
   I had just sealed this letter when Henry's of the 22d arrived- & have accordingly reopened it to make the acknowledgment- It is gratifying to learn of your continued good condition & of his having parted with his tooth ache- a most troublesome compassion-  I had not heard of any defaltations in the Kent.y Bank- nothing short of making such crimes felony can prevent them-  We have indeed arrived at a such state of morals-  Finding that the next mail goes via Providnce, I shall carry this letter there- & if anything worth penning occur
   
   will make proper not thereof-  We rece.d Franks letter of the 22d recording his & Toms marvellous escape from Hicksite contamination- tho I think they might have broken bread with J.B without fatal consequences-
   
   26th
   
   Here we are at Providence, after a run of abt. 2 hours from Newport-  We lodge at the City Hotel, a large & apparently well regulated House- we have formed no acquaintences but shall probably see some of our friends during the day- Our run up the Narragansett was not very interesting- the shores presenting little variety-  Bristol, Warren & a few neat villages were in view, but trees, those grand ornaments of nature, & wh. impart so much beauty to rural scenery & to City & Town comfort are sadly wanting-  This morn is bright & cool-  As yet we have formed no plans for the day-  When all are up we will hold a councilThe Town meeting to control the Courts is of bad omen- especially as the Judges are by our new Constitution subject for their offices to the popular will- These doings tend to anarchy and despotism, the fruit of Jacksonism- Fanny Wrightism &c[T.P.C. 8/26- Prove- -]

   Dear Clemmie,
   Grandfather desired me to acknowledge the receipt of thy acceptable letter of last seventh day. I am sorry for thy sake that it has not fallen into better hand, but if thee will believe that I have the will to send thee such a letter as would give thee a great deal of pleasure, I will rely upon the interest it will have for thee as coming from among and giving thee a great deal of pleasure. I will rely upon the interest it will have for thee as coming from among and giving thee perhaps, the latest news of some of those who think so much of thee. Anne and I entirely agree with thee in considering that the pleasantest part of the days journey was when we were all traveling together. We ran off the track about half an hour after we parted and were four hours in a pretty hot place before we were on our way again. If we had foreseen that we were to pass nearly the whole day on the road might have he fellow travelers a greater distance and lightened me and others burdens. Thee must have had a very tiresome journey all the way home Henry Drinker tells us thee had to ride from Wilkes-Barre in the hot sun in an open wagon: he thinks they did much better. When thee comes down next winder, take thou Scranton unto. We are glad to hear that thee friend Uncle William so much better and the rest all well. Grandfather seems stronger and generally better than when he fist came out in the country- He sends his love to thee and all the family. Aunt Caroline, Frank and Ellie are at Cape May. I forget whetherthey went before thee left: they wrote several days ago that Ellie’s general health was improved We have heard indirectly that Mary was unwell- Julia has gone to Reading for a few weeks. Aunt Mary returned to Jersey yesterday I believe- She was kept in turn an account of Elizabeth’s mother having an attack very much like if not really cholera. She was very ill one night: they have gone to Cape May since with Henry and Ellie. The three families that live in that unnamed corner of this country that is so hard to find am pretty much as the left them they all send their love. Elizabeth says she would be very glad if thee would write to her if thee fells so inclined. Please tell Uncle William that a package for Grandfather by Henry Drinker came safe to hand the morning- Uncle Alfred has taken the letter out to him. He comes in and spends every "third-day" in town.   
   I hope we shall hear from thee often; if thee should write to me it would give me much pleasure.
   
   Affectionately thy cousin,

   Dear Clemmie,
   
   Not having a woman's privilege as to postscripts I begin afresh.  I have no objections however to having reason to call the by name again – it seems more natural and sociable and I see thee look up from thy work or from study or quiet wordto hear what I have to say- I finished in a hurry yesterday afternoon intending to mail this before leaving town, but time failing I have an opportunity to say that Anne secured a letter from Eddy last evening in which he says nothing about his bodily conditions, but that his discontent which she had inquired about are improving" Your visit no doubt did him good. Visits from home to a boy at school are a pleasant recollections for the rest of his life.
   
   Thee did not grieve much about they blanket shawl when thee was riding in the stage at night; it will be cooler when thee comes down next fall and we will take care to sent it up to thee in time. Grandfather will be glad to hear from thee and I hope if thee is not afraid of a repetition of what thy first letter has brought upon thee, that thee will write to [.]
   
   With many desire for thy happiness.
 Affectionately, thy Cousin,

   Dear Brother:
   
   I reached this place after a pleasant journey, which occupied, as usual, 2 days.  I had pleasant company, & never before endured so little fatigue in crossing the Pokono.  the road over it is considerably improved.  I had the company of Jos'h [S?]inton  from Nazareth to Wilkes-barre.  he was on his return from attending the Orthodox Yearly Meeting.-  I was much pleased with the verdant appearance of the fields in this part of ye country.  ye season is much less advanced than usual at this time of year, but the grass looks well.-  there has not been so much done at my buildings during my absense as I expected wd. have been done, but ye workmen are now busily employed.  my Scotch farmer, I think it likely, will maintain the character of his countrymen for industry & fidelity, but I have not hired him long enough, fairly to test his qualifications.  ye female part of his family, however, it too numerous to suit me, as I have but little employment for women.-  tho' I have but little to communicate, I tho't I wd. not let a private opp'y pass without informing you of my safe arrival here & present health.  I shall feel anxious to hear from the invalids of thy family, tho' I hope they are not now invalids.-  I hope also that our new Mother may, by this time have regained her usual health.-  please give my love to all my kind friends & relatives, with whom I have so recently passed so many pleasant hours, that ye chain of communication between us, though separated, seems unbroken & strong.-  if thee shd. see Uncle Jasper please tell him, that I delivered his letter to Henry Colt, but that John N Conyngham had left Montrose before I arrived.  I therefore immediately forwarded the letter for him, to Wilkesbarre, & have little doubt but that he received it before leaving there for Bradford County.   I remain thy affectionate brother,
   Wm D CopePlease say to Eleanor, that I hope she will not mention to Cousins Abby Ann & Emma, any remarks that I made with regard to the evening company invited by them a short time before I left the City & of which I was one.  such observations are sometimes repeated under circumstances that give them an air of more seriousness than was intended by the one who makes them.[Note in second hand: W.D.

   Dear Brother:
   
   Thine of 29th ult. has been rece'd. I was pleased to learn that our parents were well, and hope that Edward & Alfred may be benefited by their proposed excursion and that thou may’st also find time to enjoy ye benefits of ye same kind of recreation. Ye country is now enlivened by visitors from ye City and Susquehanna Co. is favoured with a share of them. James Holly Biddle bro't back with them from Phila. their sisters Sarah Biddle and Mary Drinker, and E. Walker's family have ye company of ye widow Morris, and her daughters, Susan & Elizabeth. We have lately been favoured also with a visit from Joel Woolman and Alvin Keyser, appointed by Abington Quarterly Meeting to visit Friendsville Preparative Meeting. they appeared to be man of plain, unassuming humble manners, and were well received by both Hicksites & Orthodox. Cha's Shoemaker accompanied them as far as a Stroudsburg, where he became so ill, as to present his proceeding further. We have subsequently had a visit from Ja's Bell, another orthodox friend and an elder, appointed by Stroudsburg Monthly Meeting.
    
    Dan'l Stroud has been indisposed, or he also wd. probably have visited this part of his flock.  he occasionally writes excellent letters of advice to afford thee an idea of his decisive and at the same time affectionate letters of language & manner, I will give thee an extract from one of them, recently addressed to E. Walker: "distressing as is ye fact, yet it certainly is the case, that the Hicksites are a distinct Society from Friends, and ye separation proceeded from ye leaders of that seccession having become corrupted with anti-christian doctrines, mostly Socinian, but compounded with some other speculative notions, made up into bills to suit ye subjects to whom they were to be administered, and gilt with specious professions of great spirituality, to captivate members and professors with Friends. this with various practices, such as are too commonly used in electioneering, have beguiled & seduced many, who have not or had not previously embraced those awfully dreadful notions, not fitting to be styled doctrines, when we are speaking of religion, and whether these will become leavened into the mass of infidelity with their leaders, or separate from them remains among the things which futurity must disclose. that thou & I, and ye dear children Providentially entrusted to our care, may be preserved from this direful contagion, I have earnestly craved, feeling some hope, that we may resist every temptation that may beset us, to unsettle us and loss about with every wind of doctrine.
    
   If we ever knew anything, "as we ought to know", le us "walk by ye same rule and mind the same thing." Let us be satisfied with and established in "the faith once delivered to ye saints",and say with ye apostle, "thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift", in uniting Deity & virility so as to provide salvation for our fallen race, consistently with divine justine & mercy, though the august plan & means were such as Angels desired to look into.  and tho' this wonderful union is beyond their conception & ours also, we shd. be grateful for it, for surely it is exactly adapted to the condition & need of us poor frail beings, inasmuch as it is complete, or affords complete salvation, both indemnity & cure. Redemption from the penalty & power of sin; remdemption from the penalty by the atonement made by Jesus Christ, our Lord, being God & man;- and redemption from ye power or government of sin by the Holy Spirit, so received into & operating upon our hearts, as to change them, producing a birth of ye spirit & furnishing divine ability in faithful humility & obedience, to resist temptation & be preserved in divine acceptance."++++- Present my very warm & cordial love to thy very dear children, who I feel expressibly near to me. I remember ye kindness of R. T. also; and entertain sentiments of regard for our dear yound friend W. D. Cope, your near neighbour. under sensations which I am thankful for, I bid you all affectionately fare well." (signed) Daniel Stroud.-
   
   Thy observations with regard to ye precarious tenure of our hold on life, are worthy of being often recalled, & deeply impressed upon ye memory & ye heart.- with thyself, I hope & trust that ye deep concern & unbounded affection of our dear deceased Mother for us, will not have been uttered & felt in vain;- that ye expression of her hopes & fears, her sighs & sorrows, have not been for naught.-  I sincerely desire that ye change in ye management of your business, may be advantageous in a pecuniary point of view to thyself & Alfred, but ye annunciation of it, caused a shade of sorrow to pass over my heart. ye expunging of a name, upon which we have been in ye habit of looking so long, that we look upon it with a degree of veneration, seems somewhat like ye disappearance of an old friend or favourite.
   
   I have had workmen pretty constantly employed at my building since my last return from ye City, sometimes to ye number of 6 or 8, sometimes more. ye attention which these, my farm & Father's estate, occupies my time, pretty fully. ye last mentioned concern requires in its present stage & condition much attention for but little profit. but it is absolutely necessary that something shd. be done to guard against ye effects to which it is liable from an accumulation of taxes & interest. I still look forward however, to a change, decidedly for ye better, but we are so apt to be too fast in our calculations, that it becomes us to be cautious.-  I think it likely from present appearances, that my investment in ye stock of ye Leigh Coal and Navigation Co, will be a good one. I am not displeased to find myself becoming more & more interested in my farm. I form an attachment for every tree & every field, which has called forth my care & attention,- for every hill and every valley, that have afforded me gratification by their smiles & beauties.  ye lover of ye country can often realize ye enthusiasm of [Hervey], & exclaim, "when the little hills rejoice & the vallies laugh & sing, who can forbear joining ye general joy". I have at all events reason for self gratulation, inasmuch as I am more pleased with my present mode of life, than I at one time ever expected to be.- I early perceived that with my limited means, I mustbe contented with advancing slowly, in any improvements that I might wish to make, but it has been very difficult to reconcile myself to making so little progress as yet been able to make, owing to ye circumstance last mentioned as well as others.-  I expect that ye capital & influence that Caleb Carmalt is employing in favour of this County, will be of advantage to it, though we we may not feel their effects immediately in this neighbourhood.  some of E. Walker's Family, who have recently been at Friendsville, mention, that he has 30 men & 9 yoke of oxen at work on his farm.  two of his brothers, & one of his sisters have also pitched their tents at Friendsville.-  his brother James, fm Philada., has purchased a farm of 1000 acres & is employed in improving it.-
   
   With particular love to all, I remain thy affectionate brother,
    Wm D Cope
   
   Since writing ye foregoing, I have received thine of 6 ins’t. I will attend to doing what is necessary, to further ye collection of ye divd on ye Canal loan. I hardly expect that there will be any divd. this year, on ye Lehigh Canal stock, but if there should be, I will be obliged by thy informing me of it.-  in addition to the drafts referred to by thee, I passed one to C.

Woodbourne, 5 month 15th 1830
   Dear Brother:
   
   Thy acceptable letter of 7th inst.  has been rec'd.  thy observations with regard to retirement & the Christian's duty, are certainly correct in the abstract, but I think it will be readily admitted by thee on reflection, that remotely placed as thou art from ye scene in which I move, a correct opinion of ye course most proper for me to pursue, cannot easily be formulated, either by thyself, or any one similarly situated.  to be candid; I may mention, that I think myself pretty fortunate in being able by some excersize or display of management, to make a live,- to use a significant term of the Yankees here,- to possess or enjoy ye common comforts of life.  I have therefore, not much time or inducement to propound to myself sentimental or metaphysical queries in regard to duties, problematical, or supposed to be omitted.  I may be compared in some measure to an honest & benevolent day labourer. (not insinuating that I have a claim to ye character of benevolence.)-  if a distressed fellow creature cross his path or approach his cabin, no one is more willing to dispense ye comforts with which he may be blessed.  but he cannot, like his more wealthy & independent fellow-citizens, go in quest of objects of charity.-  ye call of benevolence, shd. be heard & obeyed, and I freely acknowledge that it ought to be our aim, so to arrange our temporal concerns, as to be in the way of receiving benefit & advantage from our fellow men, or of administering ye same to them, as opportunities present.  this view & reflection, I wish to bring home to myself.  but I have undertaken a business & entered upon a course of life which I had but little previous knowledge, for which I had but little previous education & of which I had formed erroneous expectations.  it wd. certainly have been better on some accounts, if I had taken up my abode in a town or village, upon my first making this county my residence.  if I had excluded farming & building from my views, my business wd. have been much simplified.  but I wished to select ye most adventageous situation for promoting the interest & settlement of Father's est'e: and I think by showing that I consider ye land and ye country good enough for myself, a favorable effect has been & will continueto be produced.  ye difficulty of obtaining assistance here, is a great drawback to ye comfort & satisfaction of ye farmer.  yet as I have put ye machine in motion, I must keep it moving, & as I am harnessed in, I must move with it, unless I have some one to supply my place.  I still indulge ye hope that I shall be able to pull things into proper train, but I begin to think that it will require about as many years to accomplish ye object, as I supposed it would of weeks, before commencing ye undertaking.  I am often however enabled, gratefully to call to mind ye advantage of my present situation, to that of remaining in the City, a victim to disease.  tho' I am thankful that my circumstances are what they are, I trust I shall have sense enough to keep in view that I am not a man of fortune, in ye sense that ye term is generally understood; and when I see how easily my income & more than my income, is fittered away, and how little is to be seen of its effects, I am induced to pause, before launching out into expensesm without calculation.  when & how, ye returns are to come, is uncertain.  a farm in a new county is indeed a quicksand, so great are its absorbing qualities; & we have to deal here with a shewd set of sharpers.  a man who is considered to be in tolerably good circumstances, & is supposed to have money, must expect to be asked two prices for everything, & they will be Jewed or Yankeed out of him, if he does not look about him with eagle eyes.-  Dr. Rose, to be sure, in ye course of upwards of twenty years has done much: but ye course pursued by one man, does not form a rule for another, differently circumstanced.  he has had a numerous class of settlers, of diversified trades & occupations to assist him, to whom he has sold land for good prices, & from many of whom he wd. probably have obtained nothing, had he not have taken pay in such kind of assistance.-  Caleb Carmalt is similarly situated.-  speaking of Caleb, reminds me of a circumstance which occurred at the last Friendsville Preparative Meeting.  he was present, and John Kite, the clerk, objected to proceeding with ye business, whilst one who was not a member of the Society, was in ye house.  Caleb said that he supposed he was ye person alluded to, but that he had proof of his being a member of the Society of Friends, which he cd. produce if necessary.  one of the Hicksites remarked, that ye meeting itself had no information, or at least no official information of C. Carmalt's disownment.  a number of remarks were made in bothsides, but there seemed to be a general sentimentin favour of proceeding with what was before the meeting, without further discussion or excitement, and the clerk accordingly complied with what seemed to be the wish of the meeting.-  this is about ye substance of an account given by a Hicksite to E. Walker.-  what I mentioned in ye preceding part of my letter with regard to charity & benevolence, also recalls to recollection ye case of Uniah Estes, one of Father's settlers, who for ye last 6 weeks or 2 months, has been afflicted with mental alienation.  Jno. Mann kept him at his house several weeks.  by judicious management there, he has been so far resolved, that it was considered safe to suffer him to return to his family.  if he shd. have a relapse which is feared, it is tho't that it wd. be advisable to send him to Friends' Assylum.  if ye information is in thy possession or can be conveniently obtained by thee, I will thank thee to mention in thy next, ye lowest term on which poor patients are rec'd into that institution.  he is a member of the Society of Friends & belongs to a monthly meeting in ye State of New York.-  Elias Bennet, an old & respectable settler on ye Susqa. Co. Tract, who, Father will probably recollect was grievously afflicted with a cancer, died in ye early part of this Spring.  he has bequeathed his farm, or his right in it, to two of his sons.-  my annual subscription in advance, to "the Friend," became due in ye early part of this month.  I will be obliged by thy having it paid when convenient, & having a rec't taken.-  please not to forget my subscription to the Athenaeum.  I wish I were well rid of my share of stock.  I did not intend to have omitted to mention, that there was no charge in my a/c with the old firm of Thomas P Cope & Sons, for my proportion of ye amo't of subscription to the "Morning Journal."  it would I think be no more than right that I shd. pay part of it.-  I shall be anxious relative to Sister Caroline, & will be obliged by thy giving me information relative to her state of health, as soon as convenient.
   
   With love to all, I remain affectionately thy Brother,

   Dear Susan:
   
   As I had hoped and expected I received the thrice welcome communication of which we had been speaking, the evening of the same day I left thee. it was handed to me by my Father, who said that he had taken charge of it in the morning, upon finding it at the Counting House. so thou had'st been thinking of me during the three weeks' interval of non-intercourse. thee is a a dear creature,  (pardon the familiarity of the expression) and I thank thee much, for it. how delightful to be though of and remembered, by those that we love! "Tho' my pen has been idle this long, my thoughts have not". I recalled these expressions of thy "talking letter", again and again, and tho' the construction admits of doubt with regard to its correctness, yet the influence that thee was thinking of me was so agreeable that I concluded to assume it as the right and proper interpretation. at all events thy thoughts must have been indirectly, if not directly turned towards me. I am unable to answer satisfactorily thy quiery with regard to the authorship of the poetical effusion that I sent thee from Woodbourne. I have frequently recurred to it during moments of calm and quiet meditation, and have derived soathing satisfaction from the consoling and pious spirit that it breathes. I suppose that I shall in due time be informed by thee who the "intruder" is, who has had the presumption to invade thy tranquil haunts, whilst occupied with thoughts of me. If he shall molest or disturb any more, he will incur my high displeasure. restingsatisfied for the present with the expectation or supposition just expressed, I bid thee affectionaly adieu. I wishing thee, "Health of body, peace of mind, quiet by day; sound sleep by night".

   I hope to have the pleasure of seeing thee in a few days.

   I reached the City, about dusk in the evening of the day that I left Bloomsdale, after a tolerably pleasant passage. the coach was not crowded, and I did not make any very interesting acquaintances, nor any with whom I felt much disposed to enter into conversation, or to enlarge upon the topics of the day. and if I had felt such disposition, it would have been an unpleasant exertion to have attempted to make my voice heard or to elevate it above the noise & rattling of the stage coach, owing to my cold, and the condition of my throat. But tho' my voice was "idle my thoughts were not". And I suspect that thou cannot give a pretty good guess as to who and what were the subjects of them. ipon glancing over the pages of Father's copy of the "Sentimental Journey", I espied the article recommended for my perusal by my friend Adeline. It is contained under the heading, "The Remise. Calais". Vol. 1 I am highly pleased with the delicate manner used by thee in adverting to the postage subject. It has reminded me of the following stanza by Pope:
   "Men should be taught as tho’ you taught them not;
     And things unknown rehearsed as thing forgot.Tis not enough your counsels still be true:   Blunt truth more mischief than nice falsehoods do.
   
   the sentiment is open to criticism, but think that there is sufficient truth in it to make it worth of a consideration. I am fearful that I may have been considered by thee remotely or in some measure, changeable with bluntness in my manner of suggesting to thee, that it would perhaps be best not to advert to any circumstances that might be of disagreeable or unpleasant nature. the suffered suitable time and opportunity to pass for alluding to the circumstance in the course of conversation with embracing it. As I am now "an engaged man", I shall be desirous of complying with all the duties and requisitions thereof, and shall therefore take care not to forget to profit by thy kind hint relative both aforesaid item of those duties. I want thee as to admired applied to another, the following line of the Poet Burns, whilst I will admire them as applied to thyself:
   
   "A gaudy dress and gentle air may slightly touch the heart,
   But its innocence and modesty that polishes the dart."
   'Tis this in Susan pleases me, 'tis this enchants my soul,
    For absolutely in my heart the reigns without control."
   
   if it were not however that the metre and force of the third line would be destroyed by so doing I am say, this is one thing in Susan, or this is part of what pleases me. I am not certain that I am literally correct in the quotations that I have made, as I depend for their correctness upon my memory, but I believe I have nearly the substance. I have made my arrangements to as to be at B. about the usual time this week, having concluded to procrastinate,fare-thee-wells. a thousand good wishes I send thee and more love than I can mention of which last may.
    
   "Thine but the impression stronger make,   Is stream their channels deeper wear."
   
   Thine unchangeably,
   [Philimus]
   
   procrastinate the two weeks interval till another time. I thought it would be so. How readily we form plans & [exences] for doing what is agreeable.

   I may say the worst that I have for years   I have had a dreadfully bad cold, and though I think it would have done me good to see thee, I must now bid all hail! to Susquehanna County, and did not feel much inclined to go into company nor was I in a very suitable condition for so doing.  I hasten to the country of cloud-capped eminences, invigorating breezes, placid lakes, ever-varying surface and romantic scenery.-  there to feel myself reinstated in the occupation which is the height of my ambition, that of an independent farmer.-  an occupation for which I do not think my partiality as yet has diminished.  "Ye generous yeomen, [---] the plough"!  before taking my flight, I wish to let thee know that I did not forget the subject of "Friendship’s Offering" relative to which we had some conversation during our last rural walk.  the reason for my not sending the said work, I will give when I again see thee.  this seems to be a small matter to [---] to, but I think it best thus to do it, as I have never yet forfeited my word or violated an engagement, and I do not wish to give any cause for so however slight for supposing that I wd. do so.  if thee gets married to any one, while I am gone, be sure that it is to a clever fellow.  I am still somewhat inclined I should like to have had one sweet kiss of thy pretty mouth, before, peradventure, I should forever be [---] the opportunity (5); however thee knows we ought to learn to submitto submit with fortitude to our fate.  I am still somewhat inclinded to the opinion, which I have before hinted to thee, that I am not well qualified to undergo the ordeal of a systematic courtship, such as is frequently, perhaps generally expected & practiced in this part of the world.  if I ever succeed in making a capture of that fair citadel, or seat of love,- a lady’s heart; it must, I apprehend be by storm, rather than by gradual approaches, long trains, dexterous manouvers, or a regular siege.
   
   I have now only to say,
   "Adieu! a heartfelt warm adieu"! from thy still affectionate friend,
   
   if thou wilt only be persuaded, dear Susan, a drab bonnet, I will on my part agree to shade my face with a broad-brim.  if we do not then attract universal admiration, who will be so bold as to say that we will not at least command general respect.
   
   I have received a notice requiring my immediate departure from the City, if possible, in order to attend the next Court to be held at Montrose.  excuse haste and all the nonsense contained in these lines.-I expect to have the agreeable company of my Cousin Rebecca Drinker as far as [Stoddartsville].  being of a cheerful disposition, I expect she will prevent my spirits from flagging.To S,

   Esteemed Friend William D Cope,
   
   I have received thy letter of the 30the of August which informes me that thee has accomplished thy journey Westward and is now at thy own home in Philadelphia. Therefore I now purpose writing thee a few lines by way of answer both to the above mentioned letter and that of the 25th of July. Friend Cope I judge thee thinks I am a very lazy fellow for nether meeting thee at West-Chester nor answering thy letter before this-time. but, as for the former I think I have a very good reason for I did not receive the intelligence of thee being there till about 5 days after the appointed time which was the only reason why I was not there for I would have been well pleased to of had the opurtunity of seeing my Friend by going the small distance of ten miles.but, altho thy friend was disappointed of the operturnity he thanks thee kindly for the invitation. The account thee has given me of Lancaster town is very similar to what I expected it was, but as for Columbia I did not expect its adjacent lands were so hilly, or, had such Mountains in them as thee mentions.I understand Friend E Lewis lately buried his son Ennoch with the flux. but I did not understan that the disorder has spread in the family.    
   With a hope that these lines may find thee in as good a state of health as I am in I conclude, and subscribe myself thy affectionate friend.

   Dear Cousin Anna,
   
   I recd thy note announcing the death of thy dear sister, and it was very thoughtful and loving of them to remember me-  though I had, the day before, recd a short note from Henry himself. It was sudden as sad to me, as I had heard nothing of her further declining health or illness. When I saw cousin Mary last was at Mt. Pleasant about 2 years ago. Then, though looking delicate, she seemed as bright and reminded me strongly of the days of her beautiful girlgood. O, those dreamlike days! of your cousins, in your Arch st. home, and the several Paradises, that the 'Doctor', and cousin Frank and I need to riflealong the Schuykill and Wissahiccon every spring- for the first and fairest flowers and how you loved to prink your happy parlors with them. I replied quite at length. For me to Henry’s letter, and told him I hoped to come on to P. to see my brothers soon, and hoped to see him which I still wish to do. It would have been a great comfort to me, if I could have come on to the funeral, but my state of health at that time prevented by a sudden change in the weather I had taken. A touch of Pleurisy which I had to break up I and we all, Mariann and Anna (who meet Cousin Mary at mt. Pleasant), were with you that sad afternoon in mournful communion. Is n't itremarkable, that you all, of your sisterhood of five, shd. have been spared to Each other so long. And as these days Mary was always so joyous a nature you must all miss her sunshine. How could our hearts bear up under all the partings on our dearest me, on Earth did we not see the vision of the Angel world and among them, our "family in Heaven". Where hope assues me we shall meet beyond all partings I fear illegible note, will find there and thin in health and with love to all and to cousins Susan & Lizzie & Fanny. I will close adding only that [Marien?] & Anna wish their love to you. Excuse my not replying to thy letters, Dear Cousin Anna, which I wasvery grateful for. For if the Dr. had not written, I should have heard, very sorrowfully so I have in several cases of Philada relations, when the first news I heard was long after: Knowing of it and I could mingle with you in Spirit, and live over our happy long days and anticipate those happier ones to come. That Death cannot end, nor sorrow overcast.
   Love especially to cousin Frank.
   
   From thy Afft,
   Cousin Edward
   
   P.S. After I wrote this last note Cousin Anna, recd Alfred cards & those for Sister Anna & Henry wh. We have forwarded to Boston. It mush be a very happy affair. All sounds and we should be glad to be present but Anna will have too send cards instead. Aff, EdwardNot Being sure of your home P.S. address I mail this for Brr David to forward.

   Dear Lily,
   
   There has been a lack of vocal or written sympathy with thee this winter, and this brief message is only to assure thee of my love and frequent thought being freshly flowing.That mere words would only weary thee I know and I only sent messages to thee by notes to Rachel. It was my hope that long before this my own strength would have retuned and enabled me to go to thee. But that is not the case as only a very little exertion ispossible yet - writing, almost is a lost art. Excuse this detail, because I could not otherwise explain my absence. Now we have heard of Edward's illness, and I wish to send by thee my love to Jonathan and Rachel, when it is convient to thee.
   
   We Also understand Edward is much beter, I hope convalescent.Dear, believe me, thy loss is shared in some degree by me, for thy lovely Agnes was especially near to me, her gentle pure spirit now a lasting place in my heart.
   
    She always seemed as one apart from our every-day routine, and now she is in full & glourious development of all her Savoir has prepared her to be for Him. Always lovingly thy
    Hannah R. Garrett.

Germantown, 9.30.83.
   
   My Dear Carrie-
   I hope the expression of sympathy & affection may be acceptable, even though there may be no new thoughts of comfort to suggest.
   
   I was so sorry to hear from Sister Lillie today that Edgar's health had been poor. I though of him as a strong man. It will be a pleasure, no doubt, though mingled with sadness, to Nettie & thee, to minister to the comfort of your remaining brother.
   
   The memory of Alexis is one of calmness & sweetness. I did not know him well, yet recall with pleasure the queit cordiality of his greeting. Samuel Morris, who rode in the same carriagewith me at the funeral, said he had learned to love him much. I think it is grateful to look back on his life here as a happy one, & his life there as is fit & glorious consummation. And he left a dear legacy in his children. I am glad you have them. I count myself so rich in my dear nephews & nieces, my young brothers & sisters, as I sometimes call them. Does thee know I am a great-aunt? My oldest nephew, Joseph Rhoads, has a wee Edgar, away out in Plainfield Indiana, where he has gone to teach. Hetty  is out there, helping. Has been away nearly 7 weeks & we don't know when we shall get her back. She went to help furnish & arrange the new little home.
   
   Fanny & Alfred Garret were here last evening a while. We do think Fannya very lively have character, & Alfred seems to be coming out a fine manly boy, & doing well at college. 
    
   How the time does fleet away! Think of it being 50 years since we were at West-town together! And what can those fleeting years show? For me, a life made up of many little things, & with too many idle hours. I enjoy my work of various kinds though; simple household cares, an extensive correspondence, partly for pleasant sympathies, partly for teaching, & on the rest days, a restful work in the care of my first-day class. Dr. Rhoads holds a school at our house and I have as my class nearly 20 boys & girls from 9 to 14 years old who troop up to my room with me. I will not claim to do them much good. I don't believe in direct religious teaching exceptwhere there is an opening for it, but I think the hour passes not unprofitably, & they learn to find the study of the Bible pleasant.    
   I hope Ellie Alderson may continue to improve. I should be glad to hear from thee if thee can feel like writing, & to be told what your prospects are.
   With Love to Nettie & Thyself,
   ever thy affectionate friend

   My dearest Anna,
    
   When we last parted I had intended to fulfill my promise of writing to thee at a much earlier period than I have done, but my time has been so much occupied that I have found it impossible to do so, and trust thee will not attribute it to forgetfulness, as I can assure thee that although absent, thee is not forgotten. Several of the family have been very much indisposed, grandfather has indeed had quite a severe attack, we scarcely thought he would recover for a day or two, but he is now very much improved and able to be about his room. The weather has been so very warm, I expect you enjoy the country exceedingly there  are but a few persons now remaining in the city, the streets are quite deserted, great numbers have gone to Cape May and other watering places. I understood from a gentleman who had just returned from Saratoga Springs, that the Hotels there were very much crowded, about four hundred visitors at one house.
    
   I regretted exceedingly you were unable to hear Friend Gurney once more before his departure, I can scarcely realise that he has indeed left our native land forever, as he now supposes; there was a little girl inquired of him if he would never return here, and was almost broken hearted, when he placed his hand upon his head and replied, that "his docks were too grey ever to expect to revisit this country". I had several op-portunities of being in company with him and they were much more delightful on account of being unexpected.
   
   The First day morning before he left he attended the North Meeting, and gave us a very interesting and beautiful sermon, taking his text from the sixty third chapter of Isaiah, ninth Verse. After meeting Sister Mary and myself were returning home, when Friend Paul joined us and said, that she had fully expected we would have called to see Friend Gurney the evening before, that there was a number of friends and young people assembled at their house, between sixty and seventy she thought, to bid him Farewell, and insisted upon our going home with her; as she said that it would be our last oppurtunity, we accordingly accepted her invitation, highly grateful as thee may suppose. Our particular facourite E. P. Kirkbride was there when we arrived, and seveal other friends. Friend Gurney was very much pleased to see us, he said that he had been expecting us, and was very glad we had come, he seated himself close by us and conversed awhile very sweetly, after which we bade him adieu, wishing him a prosperous voyage and safe return, he sent his Love to all the family a kiss to the younger ones. He had an appointed meeting at the Arch Street house in the evening. (I was very much surprised a few days after to hear that you had not attended it). It was very large, he addressed us in a very interesting manner and furnished with a most touching prayer, in which he commended all his Endeared Friends, to the protection of that Saviour, who had so long sheltered him under his parent wing, and had been with him, in joy and in sorrow in this land."
   
   When the meeting had concluded, every one rushed to shake hands with him, I think he must have stood twenty minutesbidding all farewell, until I thought his hand really must ache however all were finally satisfied, and we had just returned home, when to our utter amazement who should arrive directly after, but Joseph John he said he must see us all once more, he sat a short time with us, and we then bade him adieu, although I trust it will not be forever. He sailed in "The Roseius" on the 25th, I shall be truly glad when I hear of his safe arrival at home, for surely his children and relations must ardently desire to behold him again, if he makes such an impression upon strangers what must their feelings be? I shall leave the remainder to thy imagination; I have written a long narrative about him my Dear Anna, supposing it would interest thee, if it does not thee must excuse the length of it, and not waste thy time in perusing it. I suppose thee has most probably heard of the death of Harry Collins, and Maria’s loss of her dear little babe, his namesake, so near the same time, poor girl she must feel it very deeply. Sister Susan and family have gone into the country expecting to remain three weeks. Cousin S. Cresson is no anxiously awaiting the arrival of her son Charles &c they intended sailing on the 25th in the "Great Western" for New York, I suppose they will arrive here in a week or ten days.
   
   Brother Wm is very anxious that some of us should take a trip through Pennslyvania, we had thought of going to Cape May for the benefit of the bathing the Dr. having recommended it for George, but Mama was so unwilling that he should be near the sea, we have concluded that a mountain ride, will perhaps be equally beneficial, I do not think it likely we shall be absent longer than a week. My letter has become so very lengthy, that I have only room to add do write me a very long letter and very soon, give my love to all inquiring friends of course reserving a lrage portion for thyself and hoping this will find you all in a perfect state of salubrity believe mestill thy sincerely attached friend and cousin

   Dear Mother
   My letters do not seem to have any regular time for going to thee this summer and I cant remember when I last wrote but this is to tell thee about Aunt Lizzie Cope.  Thee probably has heard that she was not so well lately and on 2nd day Grandpa and uncle Tom went down for the day to Ventnor to see her.  They found that she was, as they had expected, much worse than when she left Awbury tho she was very glad to see them.  She had a great deal of 2
   
   trouble breathing.  Yesterday morning they up at uncle Thomas received a telegram from down there saying that she was worse and later on in the morning another one came saying that she had pneumonia which of course made them fear the worst.  Late in the afternoon another message came that she had quietly passed away at about 4 oclock in the afternoon.  Cousin Madgie, Ellie & John were all down there at the time and cousin Harry & Walter went down in the afternoon.  I did not know anything about it until late last night when I came home from the Harris (Joes) where a lot of us were at a porch party so that I did not get a  3
   
   Chance to write until this morning.  Grandpa, uncle Tom also had very little time to write as Cousin Eliza came over to supper (as cousin Walter had gone down) and Ridlgley Brown had also been asked to supper.  I do not know any thing further as of course we have not heard anything more.  I dont know when the funeral will be. 
   
   As I said before she had been much weaker lately and her heart not been as strong so that they were very much concerned about her tho the Dr did not give up hope as she said you could not tell in heart cases how long a person might live.  When Grandpa was down on 2nd day they did not know that she had pneumonia tho she was much worse than she had been.  She was up 4
   
   when they saw her.  She had a bad night and in the morning the Dr said she had pneumonia and did not look for her to recover.  I do not know how she took cold. 
   
   I have been having a great deal going on in a special way lately so that I have not had a chance to do all the things I have wanted to do,- one of which was to may Joe Morris a visit.  Alf & Henry are out there now but Joe & Ev go up to Woodbourne [---] about the 1st.  I have not time to write more at present.  Things certainly have kept moving this summer & I have had a mighty good time.  We are all very well.  Please give my love to Anna, with lots for thyself  I am as ever thine

   Dearest Mother
   I am very sorry I have been so long in answering thy letter but after Edw wrote and told thee about father I did not feel it nearly so much as my mind tho I have been walking to work and tell thee that thy letter was much appreciated and also to let thee know that I still remembered there was such a person even tho I did not write.
   
   Last week in spite of the fact that we no longer had the  rummage sale on our minds was pretty full.  On 2nd day we had our "Discipline Class" & on 3rd day Frank Ev & I read as usual.  The baby has not been as well as she might be, having had a slight [bilious?] attack.  So she has been a little more fruitful during the day tho she has been very good indeed when I have been over there in the evenings.  Ev also has not been very well as she has had a mild attack of hives which have however now passed away I believe.  While I am on the health of their family I might add that they heard the other daythat Ell has been right sick having had an attack of Gripp and there after getting better having a relapse from which I think she is now recovering.  It is too bad that she should have been sick just as this time, especially as they are getting ready to move.  but it is a good thing that Aunt L is down there to look after them.  To continue the health bulletin- Father seems to be pretty well and cheerful tho his ankle does not seem to get much better tho he [---] it.  He drives a great deal and occassionally goes out to supper & dinner (I dont know how much he goes out to dinner).  We have not had very much company in the evening tho Davis came up one night and Frank & Betty were over on 5th day night which Father enjoyed.  I expect it would be good for him if we had some more company but it seems very hard to find a time when we have not got engagements.
   
   Yesterday Joe Morris & I went up to the Rancocas and canoed.  It was a very fine day in the morning and a pretty good afternoon tho a little disappointing after the way the day started.  We had a first class time by ourselves and came home with that comfortable tired sleepy feeling.  The main reason for our going was that I wanted to ship our canoe & Sam Emlen's up to Browns Mills so that we can come down the stream next 6th day which is Good Friday and therefore a holiday.  A big crowd of people which Natalie and Elsie have asked are also going up to Browns Mills to stay over Easter and Ernest expects tobe one of them.  Edw. & I were not asked as the girls seem to think that new blood is needed which sounds very well.  I dont know exactly who all are going with them but the ladies are Natalie Elsie Mildred Sue Margaret [Werner] Katharine Buffum Eliz [Weston?], the fellows are Art, Bill, Ernest, and some other new bloods I am not certain who all. 
   
   I dont know certainly who of us are coming down in canoes but Ed & I will probably be in one boat & Sam & Marion in the other.  Tho the latter are always more or less uncertain now!  Thee knows they are expecting to married in June and Sam has asked Edw & myself to be ushers.  By the way Ed wishes me to thank thee for him for thy letter and also to give thee his love.  Harold is down at Atlantic City, or rather in transit from Atlantic City I suppose, and Ernest has taken Esther Emlen over to the Shoemakers to heat some singing so they can not send their love.  This morning I stopped for a few minutes at Uncle Franks and saw Esther.  She seemed very bright & well.  Ed stayed over there to dinner and then returned and took a drive with father while Frank & I went on a good long tramp. 
   
   Please excuse the writing blotts spelling etc for I am feeling rather sleepy & careless tho it is not late at all, the clock just having struck 9.30.  I think I will however call this to a close & go to bed which I know will please thee.  I have been getting to bed often much earlier than usual lately!!  Please give a great deal of my love to Anna & remember me to Miss R.  It will be very nice to see you all again.  With great deal of love for thyself I am always thine

   Dear Mother
   I am going to try to mend my ways and write thee a real letter!  Thee sees thee suffers from the fact thee is so good natured about our short comings.  I am afraid I sometimes write to other members of the family and not to thee because I think thee will understand it is not because I do not love thee I do not write.  I guess thee does understand this but likes to hear all the same.
   
   I was surprised to hear thee started so soon for North East Harbor and I hope that gay house party did not wear thee out so thee was not rested enough to go.  I hope at any rate thee will have a Chance to get rested at North East.  It is too bad thee has had so much trouble with thy knee but perhaps a change of air will be good for it.  I understand it is rheumatism- isnt it?  There seems to be a great deal of it around.  The other day- last 7th day it was- I had planned with Ernest to take a walk in the afternoon but suddenly in the middle of the morning a little rheumatism settled in my knee and it got quite sore so we went up to the Rancocas and canoed.  I cured mine in a jiffy by rubbing it that night with [---] which I think is fine stuff.  Has thee tried it on thy knee?  I think it might help it. 
   
   Last night I very unexpectedly went up the Valley to the Roberts with Edward Jack & Joe.  We had a very good time.  Elizabeth Perot came over to supper and helped keep things moving.  She has been having quite a bad time with rheumatism in one of her eyes but it is much better now.  We spent the night and retuned to Phila this morning. 
   
   Tonight Ernest & I are expecting to go to Uncle Franks to supper and tomorrow we start for Woodbourne on the Black Diamond which gets us up there in time for supper.  I am sorry that Evelyn fine stuff.  Has thee tried it on thy knee?  I think it might help it.

   Tonight Ernest & I are expecting to go to Uncle Franks to supper and tomorrow we start for Woodbourne on the Black Diamond which gets us up there in time for supper.  I am sorry that Evelyn will not be up there but I am looking forward with much pleasure to seeing the others.  I do not think Edw has planned to go away over the end of the week so he will be out at [Dimdale?]. 
   
   Next week I suppose will bring quite a change in the numbers at Germantown as people generally have to come home about the 10th.  It has been very quiet since we came back from the [---] and it will be nice to see some more people around once again. 
   
   I suppose the family will stay up at Jamestown until some time about the 23rd though I have not heard any date mentioned.  Harold said he expected to come home about the 10th to do some work By the way I got from the barrel of Educators over at Grand[---] 5lbs the other day.  I do now know how much they are a lb. & I wonder whether thee would mind settling with uncle Tom for them.  I only took 5lbs as the barrel  was pretty empty and I thought I had better have some in it.  I think there are about 5lbs left. 
   
   Family affairs move along very quietly and very reasonably smoothly.  Occassionally our fair Margaret gets a little ruffled under the collar but we have had nothing serious happen at all.  As her second childhood is coming on she gets more and more  forgetful so that sometimes I think it will not be long before we  will be summoned to table and find it almost unused.  The other night she admitted supper was late because she had put the lima beans on to cook but when she went to take them off she found nothing but boiling water as she had forgotten to put the beans in the pot!!  It does very nicely for summer time when no one is in a hurry but it would be a little annoying if such things happened when we are busy. 
   
   The days are getting so short now we do not have much chance to play tennis unless we get an early start and as Ernest does not  get out of town until the 505 at the earliest we have not played much.  Edw and I however had a little practice.  We have also been kept from playing by a great deal of [---] cool,- almost cold,- weather.  Yesterday it rained very hard but has cleared up Today and I hope we will have clear weather over the end of the weak, though we will have a very good time no doubt even if the skies are cloudy.
   
   Please give a great deal of love to Grandma.  And with the same for thyself I am
   Thy loving son
   Algernon
   
   Also please give my love to uncle T. (over) P.S.
   I almost again forgot to thank thee for those very pretty little needle & thread holders which thee sent Harold & me.  We really appreciated them very much and they were most convenient to have.

Meadowfield 9.3.
   
   My beloved sister
   I feel as tho' I wanted to send thee another greeting before you leave Newport, thy last letter was very welcome with its good report of your welfare, I trust you have all continued in good case & will return home strengthened for the cares & duties of the winter.  As to dear little Edward, I do not suppose we shall know him, nor doubt he has changed much, I hope he will make up his mind to take food when he really needs it, perhaps he may take to a cup & spurn if a bottle is too insulting to his dignity.  Rebekah Smith's little boy is growing nicely & is a cute baby with the large dark eyes, your children ought to our ideas, & tho' his fractures are rather too large now for baby beauty he promises to develope that trait after awhile; at present his great charm is his good behavior, which is a real comfort to his mamma as her nurse left her sooner than she wished & she has only a young girl to assist her in taking care of him.  I suppose it will not be very long now before you are turning your faces homeward & it will be pleasant to think of your bring near us.  tho' we shall not see one another for awhile.  I am glad to hear from a letter to Katharine from Jthat you will not move into your own house until the 11th month, as I would like to be on hand at that season, having a fancy for such dissipations.  I have seen allusions in the papers to the burning of The Cliff House, but have not seen any account of the event, what a favor you were not there! & how about the boarders, did they lose their things was anyone hurt, poor Mrs Emmons I hope she was not there, (or thy Aunt Lizzie).  By the way what do you hear of the latter.  I trust her trip to England has been of use to her, when do you expect her back.  I am sorry to hear that Hazen is not very strong, perhaps he did too much, it seemed a very short time to be absent.  Since our last letter to thee we have had a visit from Susan Kito & Amy Roberts, they are bothundemonstrative people, especially Susan, but they enjoyed being here I think, SK was not well & did not like to ride so we had a quiet time, reading, talking, examining flowers & looking at objects in the compound microscope, one of Frank's late investments; they took tea at sister Eleanor's & also at Joshua's.  Sister Eleanor's summer home was vacated on 3rd day, she, Tom, Ellie, & Walter drove home with the two horses & carriage she spent one night at Arondale & one at HM Stokes at Chester & reached Germantown on 5th day evening.  Hetty & Wistar have gone to "Uncle Gideon's" & Betty is staying with us; the stay down here has been a real succes, the children have been very well & happy, have found much to interest & occupy them.Wistar & Franky have spent many hours in "bug hunts" & do manifest much zeal in the collection of beetles, butterflys & moths, & really have quite a large number; we labor under great difficulty as far as the study of the subject is concerned, as we have no books on Entomology except one by [Wood?] which treats of British insects, I quite want to get some good work & be able to learn the names of some of the creatures the boys have.  I have wandered away from my starting point, sister Eleanorfound the quiet of the country life & the absense of the many demands on her time & thoughts that she has to meet in Germantown a great rest, & altho' the house has not much to attract as regards situation it did not make the same difference to her it would to us, as she is so fond of riding she was out almost daily & enjoyed taking others drives.  Thee may remember Katharine & I find great comfort in sitting under the trees or lying in the hammocks when not busy sewing.  I suppose Hetty will stay down some weeks yet, her trip to Mt [Desert?] brokeinto her summer & I think she dont feel at all ready to leave Maryland.  John & Walter came down yesterday with Frank but dont expect to make much of a visit as they talk of going back tomorrow.  We heard a report that Sophy Kimber was to be married at Newport this summer, does thee know if it is so, her certificate has been sent on from 12th st, we shall miss her from Germantown she is so efficient & willing.  Now my dear sister when thee writes, which I hope may be [---] long, please tell us how thee is, Katharine wishes to know if thee has picked up any fat in the cool air, how does thy nurse geton, I hope she has proved an efficient help.  It is raining quite heavily now, which is not as acceptable as at some seasons, but when I think how we have longed for it in former days I dont like complaining.  The season of canning has arrived & folks in this part of the country are busy enough putting up corn, tomatoes & peaches &c, I should feel dubious about eating the products of some of the factories, as they employ Bohemians whose cleanliness is more than doubtful.  We were quite startled to see the death of Mary Morton yesterday, she spent a few days with Rebekah some 2 weeks ago, but was not well then & wished to get to Phila, it is such a favor she went up when she did or she might have died here.  Please give my love to thy mother & Lilly, kiss the dear children for me & accept for thyself a message of warmaffection from thy attached sister K sends love Hannah B. Evanscan thee tell us anything of the Newhalls.  Ive not heard from A for some time & fear her mother is more poorly.

   My beloved brother
    
   Thy letter of love and sympathy was very acceptable for tho' our friends cannot do much for us just now we do appreciate their sympathy. I am sorry I cannot tell thee that dear Katy is better, her fever still continues tho her temperature is one degree down this morning. I believe I told thee the typhoid symptoms had disappeared, which conclusion I jumped at from hearing the Dr. say the trouble about the abdomen was gone, and tongue clearing off, but on saying something like it to the Dr., he replied he thought they seemed to be developing much more then in the first weeks of the sickness.  Dr. Newlin Stokes came down to G. Smith's funeral yesterday, saw Katy and had a consultation with Dr. Sapington. Yesterday for the 1st time a few spots appeared in the abdomen and the Dr.s both said that was the 9th day of the typhoid fever, so dear child she has a long siege before her yet. It was a great satisfaction that Dr. Stokes said the case had been treated just as he should have done and he had no change to suggest except giving valerian instead of bromide to quiet her at night. They both unite in giving little medicine, only quinen to keep up her strength and all the nourishment she can take. Dr. [Lapingson?] thought perhaps Valentines extract did not suit her so we now squeeze the bloodOut of raw beef and give her that every four hours. Sam will send us down a druggists press, which will be a help in getting the juice out. Both Dr.'s said we ought to have a nurse, Dr. Stokes said he know of one he thought we could get, Frank telegraphed for her and I think Thomas Cope will probably see her for us tomorrow and if suitable send her down. It will be a comfort to have some one who is skilful and can move and change Katy with less fatigue than we do. Frank stays with Katy part of every night and helps much with the nursing, but Katherine is so anxious and nervous I fear she will be quite laid up unless we have some help. Katy's fever is not high, 102 2/10 the highest her temperature has reached and todayit is a degree less. She has little disturbance of the bowels and no head ache, her mouth and throat are very uncomfortable, feel gummy and sore and she feels very weak and weary. Slept but little last night and the hours were long and tedious for her, she is very patient but at times is nervous. Edith seems to be gaining, is taken down stairs everyday and takes tea with us, Dr. took her temperature today and found it a little below normal, says she must have a little brandy. It is rather depressing for her and [Esther?] and frankly, we are so taken up with Katy and the house has to be kept so quiet, so it is proposed for them to go to Uncle's for a few days and when Edith is stronger they may go to Awbury. If sister Eleanor takes Ellie away perhaps the girls could accompany her. I am glad to know you are better for Newport air, we had a very nice letter from dear Rachel please thank her for it and let her see this as I shall not have time to write to her now. I rejoice to think thee spent some days at Batemans and do hope thee feels stronger for it, thee will be lonely at Awbury with so many of both families away. With much love from usAll I am thy attached sister Hannah. I remember this is thy birthday.

Dr says Katy is holding her own very well, her temperature is rather lower this morning than at the same time yesterday.  101 today & her skin more natural.  She slept a good deal last night, but does not seem quite so drowsy this morning & therefore more conscious of her discomforts.  Dear child she gets discouraged  at times, the days seem so long.  I was writing for a tooth brush but Katharine says Katy has just got a nice soft one.  Sam sent us down a press for the beef, so we can get the juice out with less labor.  I hope Ernest is doing well, my love to Rachel & the others at Newport.  With love thine truly

   My dear sister
   
   I am once more at home and quite miss hearing of thy welfare and dear Anna's from Jonathan's letters.  I hope you still continue to gain and enjoy the mountain air.  When I got home last 2nd day, I felt very much used up with the heat & the change in air, but now have become accustomed to it and feel quite well, tho' the amount of moisture in the air makes things damp & sticky.  No doubt thee has heard particulars of E.W. Copes last hours, the close must have been very peaceful, both Ellie & Madgie express their feelings of thankfulness that their mother did not have to endure long confinement and great suffering.  The funeral was small, so many are away, S. Morris and E Allen bore testimony to her character, there was nothing said at the grave but there was such a sweet, quiet feeling as we stood silently there in the evening lights, everything looking so beautiful & peaceful, words did not seem to be needed.  E. Allen said after meeting today to Eleanor & me, that after sheheard of E.W. Copes death she went into her room and such a sweet feeling came over her, she felt it was a forecast of the rest & peace into which Elizabeth Cope had entered.  I rode to the ground with cousin Rebecca Evans, she spoke of cousin Elizabeth, said the letter thee wrote her had been such a particular comfort and help to her, that Rebecca had felt she must write & tell thee but has been rather burdened with calls, so I said I would let thee know about it, I think R sent her love to thee.  Will & Grace have both had mumps, and little Mary, (Alice'sdaughter) has been very sick, she is now gaining down at the Dennis and Grace has been there with them.  Cousin Wm & John Rhoads have gone to T. Brown's camp for their vacation.  I send thee one of Esthers letters as thee may be interested to hear something of the Conference.  It seems to have been a time of spiritual refreshment & uplifting & I hope may prove of use to the building up of the Church.  Eleanor says the spirit of love & unity was very marked, Alfred urged that all [---] and feelings of antagonism between old & young, conservative & progressive should be laidaside, which seemed to be the case.  Alfred seems to feel his mind relieved of the concern, he went back to Bupshire yesterday & is going on to Northfield.  Frank Goodhue also went to Bupshire will spend today there & go on to Brattleboro taking little Mary with him.  Edith Silver came up on 5th day eve, it was very pleasant to see her, she went home yesterday, Betty & little Elizabeth & Sam Mason all went with her.  Betty intends spending a couple of weeks at Swallowfield where she hopes to have a good rest.  Francis Jr is at Bupshire so all the children are cared for.  Sister Eleanor & Tom I believe are going to Bupshire soon & Wistar to the South on business so the house will be deserted  for awhile.  Katy & the childrenpropose coming home on 3rd day.  Frank came on to the funeral but went back last night, I am glad for him to have a visit there.  Emma Edwards fell in her house and broke her hip, she is now very ill not expected to live & her life is not to be [---] under the circumstances.  I had an active time last week attending meetings but got on better than I expected to, tomorrow is Phila Quarterly Mg & 5th day ours, after that I shall take a rest and do a little here at home, as I see many things that need looking after.  I dont know when Esther will come home probably in about a week.  A great deal of love to dear Anna & also for thyself from thy attached sister

Awbury
   9/30/1906
   
   Dear Mother, 
   
   It certainly does seem much more than two days since we parted from thee and Anna, Miss Richardson and Harold on the ferry wharf at Jamestown. I don't know why the time should seem so long but it is even hard to realize that only last Tuesday father and I were looking out over the Bay blue as could be in the sunlight of a splendid September day as we sat on the deck of the "General" on our way to Wickford. It seemed a great shame to spend so good a day in that stuffy parlor car.
   
   We got through the packing very comfortably, and (although father did say that in the middle of one night he thought we would never be able to get it all done) with very little worry I think. The only thing now is that none of the freight has yet come. We seem to be getting along very nicely on what we have brought.
   
   Since my arrival at home I have been to see two of my doctor friends. Dr. Van Pelt and Dr. Bassett the latter fixed me up without doing anything very much, a lucky escape for me because I haven't been to the dentist for over a year and Dr. Van Pelt is going to make an examination of my eyes with the aid of drops later on in the year. He goes away tomorrow and thought there would hardly be time to do it now. 
   
    Last sixth day afternoon Father and I took a drive. We went up through the Wissahickon, pretty as usual though the foliage hasn't changed much and then stopped at the Philadelphia Cricket Club grounds where I met Alg. And we had some tennis. Father seems pretty well I think and says he has enough to keep him busy in town for some time so perhaps it is just as well the freight hasn't come yet or he might try to do something at once.
    
    Yesterday I went up the  Rancocas with Harold, George and Esther, Eleanor Haydock and Anita Downing. I believe Harold thought some of the members of the house party wouldn't be able to go so did not try to get there to-gether this time. In spite of the fact that it was a threatening day and rained just as we reached the ferry and notwithstanding the fact that Harold and I forgot to eat any lunch we had a very nice time and escaped any wetting. It cleared up before we got back and the moonlight was beautiful. Our only accidents were, I think, that Esther [---] on the [---] of a very irascible old Irish woman in the trolley car who swore around at a great rate and was not at all mollified by Esther's apology. Then Eleanor dropped her umbrellaafter meeting broke up. John and Mary Emlen were there and altho. they tried to get off pretty quickly thee may be sure a lot of us caught them and detained them for a word or two.
   
    Alf. is coming to us for supper which will be very nice. Alg. is now reclining on the sofa reading and sends his love to thee and Anna and Aunt Lilly. Before I close I must ask if thee has heard of the latest engagement--Billy Haines to a Miss Janvier, of Orange, NJ and niece of Thomas Janvier who writes for the magazines somewhat.    
     [---] in Alg's message of love to you all and [---]
   
   They affectionate son
   Edward

   Dearest Family, 
    
   I have just been reading a very nice letter from Polly, which I was rightly glad to get. If you think of it tell her so with a great deal of love and many thanks from me. Then I have some more beautiful flowers to thank thee for,  Father dear. They were truly beautiful, and are still lovely though some of them, the roses especially, show their age! Miss Richardson thought they were packed better and seemed fresher if anything than the ones from [Waltemates?]. I suppose my attack of Grippe was the excuse for my having these, but I am afraid it sounded more than it was.  I dont think the doctor was atallsure it was Grippe, & if it was I dont think Ive heard of such a light case!  Thank thee [---] so much , dearie, for the lovely flowers and the letter that came with them.  I'd like some more of the last mentioned article whenever thee has time & feels like it but thee really mustnt send me any more of the former.  While we are on the flower subject, just pay thyself $5.00 from me, will thee?  I have moneyin bank I think, & my flower bill this month or lately will about amount to that I think.  I have been indulging myself by sending some to different people.  Some violets to Miss Stedman (who has had a cold) etc.  People have been so kind to me here.
   
   I havent got to the boys photo. yet, there are so many things to say.  I think it is mighty nice, & I am so glad to have it.  It is a little like seeing them.  It stands on my bureau & this morning I burst out laughing just looking at it.  I could just imagine from seeing their expressions the kind of time they had getting it taken.  Edwards expression especially makes me laugh.  Thank you all for it ever so much.  You must feel somewhat repaid for all your trouble, for it is so nice to have it.  If AuntLilly or Ellie have room I think I'd like some of my other photos.  Any that you can find.  Also my other belt buckle, if you can find it easily.  I think I had it at Conanicut.  It is a clasp & looks something like silver.  It isnt important at all.  If you have a copy of "She Stoops to Conquer" that isnt too nice perhaps you would send that too by them, ormail it to me later if you havent finished reading it by the time they come.  I just thought maybe I'd like to read it as you all are.  Oh & if you know where my visiting cards are I think it would just as well for me to have some & a card case if you can find one.  I dont suppose I need them, but I might want one for something later on.  I'd rather also like to have my black bloomers (sort ofsilk they are made of) sometime, but there is no hurry.
   
   I am sending thee, dearest Mother, something I started for thee last Fall, but have only finished lately.  I thought thy old one was pretty well worn.  I dont think I showed thee when thee was here the hound glass I got Miss Webb to get me as a birthday present from thee.  Does thee remember thee told me to get one & never did? It is a very nice one I think.  The usual shape & white celluloid I think.  Now I am talking to thee.  I'll just say one or two things I want to.  First Miss Richardson asked me to thank thee for thy message & to remember her to thee.  She is so nice.  Sweet & jolly- I think I am very fortunate.  Thee ought to hear us laughing over things sometimes.  Sheis young & ready for fun.  Then if thee thinks of it when thee writes to Cousin Hannah wont thee give her my dear love and thanks for the little book & the letter she sent me at Christmas.  And please give my love to Cousin Sallie too and thank them both for the very nice message they sent me when I was first taken sick.  I have on the table in front of me a nice fat looking letter from thee, Mother dear, but I'm afraidI wont have time to read it before I finish this, as I am going sleighing in a few minutes & the postman may come before I get back.  Thank thee for it though ever so much.  And thank thee, dear Ern, for thy nice one which came the early part  of the week.  It was nice to hear from thee once again.  If there are any loose pictures ofour house & Awbury floatinh around send those with the other photos.
   
   Now good-by.  With a great deal of love for each one of you, dear ones, I am
   Your loving
   Anna
   
   PS.  Please give my love to the girls & remember me to Simon if he is still with us.

Thursday-
   March 21st
   
   Darling little Mother, 
   
   I am going to begin my letter to thee to-day, though I dont think I will send it at once, as I sent one home yesterday, which I imagine thee will receive the end of this week, that is if they send it on at once.  But as  I am expecting to be taken sick to-morrow or next day & may not feel like writing.  I dont think I will do any [---] to begin my letter now.  I think I have told most of the news in my letter home.  Wasn’t it fine about my going in to see the pictures?  I think I will mail thee the catalogueas thee might be interested, & it is very prettily gotten up.  I am sorry that the pictures in the catalogue are not the ones I especially enjoyed, for I should like to have had copies of some of them, & the pictures in the catalogue are pretty enough to frame-  I mean the finish & all.  The coloring of the Blue Boy & his pose Iliked, also the coloring of the “Little Girl with Doll” was lovely, but I didn’t care much for them.  The Blue Boys [---] was an unusual shade of blue, bordering on green but soft & not starey & there were lovely shades of old rose in the Little Girl etc.  The ones I marked were the ones I liked, especially “The Elder Sister,” & the Romney ones,a dear little head by Bougereau & perhaps some others I dont just think of.  The little childs head by Gilbert Stuart I was interested in & rather liked.  I hardly saw the modern ones at all, as we had only about 20 minutes there. 
   
   Wednesday morn. 
   I am almost sorry I didnt finish this letter up some days ago & send it  even if I could say all I wanted to- for I shant be able to do that now, as I want it to go by this morning’s mail-  I have been unwell since I started this- taken just on the day, isnt it fine?- I’ve been as regular as can be lately- in fact ever since last Fall sometime.  But I must hurry up &say some at least of the things I want to.  I sent the catalogue of the pictures to thee last Monday, but dont know whether thee will ever receive it, as I directed it to Berkley- Thee put Berkley, Md, at the head of thy letter so I thought I’d try it & I put my address on it, so it will come back to me, I guess,if it never reaches thee.  I also sent thee the little [sagne?] & hoods & socks I have been making, thinking thee might like to see them.  I hope thy trunk isnt very crowded or they may not be as welcome as I should like.  I directed them to Darlington, I dont believe the little sagne would bebig enough for Edith’s baby, so dont bother about it.  Thee will probably be a baby some of these days I shall want it for, & the little hoods may be useful, too.  I’m glad to have learned how to make them at any rate. 
   
   It is nearly time for  the post man, so I’m going to say good-by & write the rest again.  If any one of the boys should want to know something to give me on my birthday, I’m very fond of Burne-Jones “Hope” & should like a photo of it, but remember only if they want to knowsomething.  I must finish in a rush & with a great great deal of love, darling from
   
   Thy little Daughter.

   My dear Mother
   
   Altho I have written to father and Tom has also written a long letter so that I am afraid they will be as uninteresting as "twice-told tales" yet I am going to send thee a few lines in a scrappy way for they own edification. We do so enjoy having Tom with us and he seems to be not only enjoying himself but improving--when he first joined us at London he looked very badly not having recovered from the sea voyage I suppose he was very pale and thin, but has been gaining pretty steadily so that now his cheeks have quite a color and he looks fuller in the face than I ever remember to have see him--I do not think his leg troubles him much, as he says it does not hurt him, and he walks about a good deal--we shall try to keep him from doing too much--
   
   I think Chellie seems stronger than when we left home, as she is certainly able to walk more and does not get as fatigued as she would at home--
   
   She has gained some flesh but is not what you would call stout yet. For a day or two her throat has been a little swelled, but I shall get her some [tannin?] or a gargle and I think that will relieve her. I have written [---] particularly in regard to health as I know thee would like to know. The weather except a few days in London has been cool so that we have generally not been able to wear our [thin?] clothes. Chellie has not found her waterproof dress to wear for traveling and now that we are going north shawls are called into acquisition. Evening 9.05. I wish thee could look in upon us this evening and see how snugly we are fixed, seated around a centre table in our cosey little parlor with four candles burning upon on the table and at this point Tom came in and proposed we should take a row upon the lake in the moonlight and as it was a lovely evening we went and now have just returned--I did wish for some of the girls form Awbury for it was so perfectly beautiful that even the [staid manied?] people almost grew sentimental--The lake was just rippled by the gentle wind and the moon was hanging over the western mountains throwing a silvered path across the water, and on the shores we could dimly see the outlines of Wray Castle and the pretty residences with which the shores are studded, and in which the lights were brightly shining. The rain which continued most of the day stopped toward evening and although the roads were rather muddy we started out for exercise and had a pleasant walk of three miles toward Bowness. [---] tt has cleared we expect to start early tomorrowmorning for Keswick. As this letter is for thy information on little points in travels I will tell thee of our general hours. We find it suits us best not to dine later than three or half past and so whether we take our dinner at the hold or elsewhere try to have it at that hour. We breakfast generally at half past eight and then take tea at half past seven or eight and spend our evening in our sitting room either writing home or in journals or in talking over the scenes of the day and planning for the morrow. In traveling we generally manage to have a car to ourselves and Reuben looks after the baggage and Tom eitherkeeps him or assists Chellie and H, while I am buying our tickets-  We get along very nicely indeed-  In the last letters thee said that some of them at home thought "thee was writing too much", I hope thee will not stay thy hand on that account, but only as thy strength will warrant, for I can assure thee every detail of home news is very interesting-  We think of you very very often and I hope the time may come when thee will enjoy the beauties which we are visiting, but altho the present is so full of enjoyment the future (when we shall return to your midst) looks very pleasant.
   
   The little books dear mother, which thee gave us just before leaving are our constant compantions in our travels and it is pleasant to think as we read them morning and evening that thee too has them and altho the time may be different yet we read them the same day-  I enclose a little bunch of wild flowers which I picked while visiting Swarthmore part of them I gathered at the meeting house and part from the Hall, I wish they were better preserved but they were pressed under difficulties in my pocketbook and I had to arrange them for pressing as we walked.  I send them thinking thee might like a little memento of Swarthmore-  I am afraid this will prove a scrappy letter and rather uninteresting for it is madeup of little nothings-  Hannah desires her love to thee and the rest of the Awbury family-  When thee sees them at School Lane please give them my love also a great deal to all at home and at Uncle Toms and Uncle John's, Chellie has retired or would join me in these messages-  With much love I am thy loving son
   J.Evans.
   P.S.  I dont know if any mention has been made of how Reuben is and as his father and mother were rather anxious about him when we left, will thee tell them that I think he is much better, but would improve faster if he took more rest especially in writing his letters and journal as he often sets up late and is up early-

   My dear Mother
   
   I hope this evening that no one has written home for a day or two and know thee will like to hear often so I will send a few lines this evening before the mail closes.  We have had a very warm day the thermometer standing at 83 [degrees] a good deal of the time and there has been very little air stirring-  This morning Mary, Alexis Alf, John Hazen and Henry made an excursion to the top of Kate's Mountain.  They had an early breakfast and got off about 8 oclock and did not get back until nearly one.  They had a pretty rough scramble and some how did not get to the right place and so missed the view-  I was glad they went as they thought it paid and I am afraid they find it rather monotonous-  The life is a very lazy one and while it is so warm in the middle of the day there is very little to be done in the way of excercize, with any comfort-  I think Alf seems better and the water suits him but Hazen is not able to drink the sulphur water and does not seemed to have impreoved as much as I hoped he would-  I do not mean that he is sick but he still looks pale.  He seems bright and much less nervous than when he left home and I hope he will improve more after his return-  Lily has bathed twice (yesterday and today) having her bath at about 100 [degrees] and says she thinks it suited her for after lying down she felt refreshed and better-  but of course it is too soon for there to be much change-  She stayed in the first day only about 2 minutes and today 5 so thee sees she is feeling her way.
   
   This afternoon Lily and Alexis took a drive-  I have been disappointed 3
   in the air here it is not bracing at all-  and as the mountains are all around us often we get but little breeze-
   
   The daily routine of our life here is not thrilling-  We rise about half past seven and it is often half past eight before we get assembled at the breakfast table-  After breakfast (which we rarely get through until quarter past nine) we walk around the grounds for a little while visiting the spring, Japanese Store, Post Office &c and then spend the time until 11 o'ck (when we bathe) either in reading, writing or talking-.  After the bath we put in the time as best we may until dinner time 2 O'clk.  After dinner we set out under the trees upon the lawn or upon our piazza and read aloud or talk until tea time and after tea we generally take a walk and then sit in the parlor until bedtime "and thus our days go on, go on"  The boys vary it occasionally by a little walk upon their own account or by going swimming or sometimes we roll a game of ten pins-  I have gone very much into details and I have no doubt father and Tom will laugh at the letter and groan over such a life (so do I) but I thought these little nothings would interest thee and moreover there is very little else to tell-  Our movements in the future are very uncertain and as yet we cannot say when we shall home or whether some will remain- as soon as some conclusion is arrived at we will let you know.  Please give a great deal of love to father Tom Anna & Carrie in which Chellie would join me if she knew I was writing but I am in the gentlemans writing room and she does not know of it-  With much love for thyself I am thy loving son J. Evans

Title: 1875 November 28, Church Lane, to brother

Church Lane 11 mo 28. 75
   
   My dear brother
   
   Having received a message from thee through a letter to Tom, and not being able to plead sickness as a reason for not writing, I am going to send thee a greeting-  Well we are not going to see thee until next spring, it seems a long time, and we were all of us not a little disappointed when the news came.  We were counting the days until the time when thee was to sail and beginning to speculate upon the probable length of the passage, when suddenly all our hopes were dashed-  I was going to say I would not flatter thee by telling thee what lamentations there were on the part of some of us, but I think it does no one harm to know how much they are loved and missed at home, on the contrary I think  to a young man it does good, tending perhaps to keep him out of some things by which he might otherwise be tempted-  Now for the scrape of news I can glean up-  Last fourth day Tom and I drove over to Haverford to bring away thy [chattels?]-  We arranged to go on third day, but on that day we had a regular old fashioned Nor'easter and it poured most of the day-  The next morning about nine oclock Tommy appeared at our house in the [---] with Lady and Eric (Harry having been laid up some time with sore feet) after getting some more warm wraps for it had cleared off quite cold when we started-  The roads were in a pretty miserable state of muddiness and as we undertook to go by the Lancaster road we almost stuck so to speak-  However we reached the College about half past eleven, and finding the students in recitation we went up stairs and explored-  We found all thy things had been moved out of thy room and were locked up in another closet of which the matron hadkey so she had to be hunted up-  We packed most of the books and some other things in a drawer which Tommy and I carried down to the front door Tommy saying it was "like carrying down a little coffin"-  We donated to Frank Haines a bottle of eye wash, a little bottle of carbolic acid and a few other valuables?-  Thus were the last rites performed-  We packed the books in the bottom of the wagon, and put the precious articles, around with we supposed tender associations ( clung , (a broken fan with names thereon &c) between folds of the down cover-  We drove home to dinner reaching Awbury about quarter of four-  We had a good laugh at Tom - one of the objects over was to bring home the hanging book shelf and we forgot all about it, and came home without it - which rankled in Tommy's breast-  By the way talking of Haverford does thee know they have raised a sufficient amount of money to enable them to build, and Samuel Alsop Jr told me it was decided to go ahead-  The day we werethere was the day before Thanksgiving day, and as I waited upstairs in the entry while Tom was hunting up the Matron I was amused at two of the students, one was in the hall down stairs and as the other came out I suppose from recitation - he announced the fact that they were going to have Turkey for dinner, whereupon there went up such a howl of rejoicing as almost upset me-  We hoped while at Haverford to have had time to have called upon Margaret Yarnall, but we spent to much time at Any Marys that we had not time.  I suppose you have heard that Ellis and M Yarnall are boarding at [---] during the Winter.  I am glad to hear they are vert comfortably fixed-  It seems an out of the way kind of place for them, a good deal away from most of the latter's friends, I should think she would long to have her daughter with her.  I do feel for them very much-  First day 12/5.  A week, my dear Afred, has passed since I commenced this letter yet it is not finished.5
   During the week we have been pained from day to day to hear of Uncle Alfred's increasing illness.  As early as the beginning of the week Dr Wister said he seemed to be failing, and on second day they telegraphed for James, they received an answer the next morning only saying "will come" and that is all they have heard.  Up to second day Uncle Alfred has been able to get over into the library, this he has accomplished with the aid of a man who has been staying with him at night for a number of weeks- assisting him to dress and undress.  One second day he was so much weaker that he had to remain in bed- and since then he has been gradually growing weaker and weaker, until yesterday afternoon about three o'clock he quietly passed away-  He does not seem to have had any acute disease-  His appetite almost entirely gave out, and he gradually weakened - with the exception of a pain in one of his lungs I do not think he has suffered any-  Since last first day Uncle Tom and John E Carter have been sitting up with him half of alternate nights, the nurse sitting up the other half.  Lilly and Edward have been staying over at Fairfield for the last day or two-  Yesterday morning having heard how he was the evening before Father, Uncle Tom and Aunt Lizzie went over there, the Doctor came soon after they arrived and said he did not think he could live but a few minutes.  They went up into his room (except Father who had gone on to town) and sat there for two hours awaiting the close- he seemed entirely conscious but lay perfectly still excepting once when he passed his hand through his hair as his custom was and once he put his hand under his head-  They went to dinner and a few minutes after dinner was over he passed away, no one but Aunt Rebecca, Lily and Edward being present.  Just at the close, there was a short spasm and then to him all was joy and peace and rest-  What a wonderful and glorious change it must be for him after a long life of ill health and suffering during which I suppose he could never have said he really felt well, to awake inthat Holy City none of whose inhabitants can say I sick and where "there shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, neither shall there be ay more pain: for the former things are passed away"-  Aunt Caroline seems to feel it very much, not having seen for some time except a few days ago, when hearing how sick he was she went out to see him, but ut was thought best for her not to go in the room or let him see her so she looked at him through the door-  The only remarks I have heard that Uncle Alfred made (though he probably said more which I have not heard) were that some days ago he told J.E.C. "that it made very little difference which way it ended" meaning his sickness-  To E. Allen who visited home within a few days, and as she was leaving said she supposed she should never see him on earth again and that she did not doubt but that the change would be a glorious one to him he replied "I have been forced to feel very quiet and peaceful"  I think those were the words he used-  The funeral is to be next third day at two oclock.  It will be a great trial I doubt not to James to find all over when hearrives - 
   
   Last sixth day Uncle Tom commenced his winter readings and it was said to have been a very interesting occasion-  Neither Chellie nor I was able to get there-  There is a good deal of stir in our City now over the meetings of Moody & Sankey-  They have fitted up the old freight depot of the Pennsylvania RR so that it will seat about eleven thousand and meetings are being held I think twice on week days and three times on first days - they are largely attended and from accounts some of them must be impressive.  I hope they may do good-
   
   I suppose Mother in her weekly letter told you that Hazen had sprained his ancle, turned it under him as he was rushing out of the side door to catch the train-  Tommy seems to think it was a mercy he sprained it as it will probably save him from something worse if he will only take warning.  He had to hold it up for nearly a week.  However he is about again now tho he says it feels weak.  Aunt Lizzie Brown is still down at Atlantic City where she has been for some 9
   weeks and from accounts does not seem much better.  Aunt Fanny went down last third day taking with her a maid to stay with aunt Lizzie-  I am afraid her sickness is a pretty serious one and not to be gotten over in a hurry.  The rest of them at Grandfathers are pretty well now-  Grandfather has had a cold but is better-  Aunt Martha Leeds I suppose you have heard is at the Frankford Asylum, and from last accounts was not much better in her mind and was also very sick with [---] in her head-  I dont know whether thee has heard or not that the new building at Haverford is to go up next year they having got enough subscribed to warrant them in commencing so Samuel Alsop Jr told me.
   
   Lillies letter from [---] arrived on sixth day last and we were very glad to hear of your being so comfortably and pleasantly fixed-  Please give a great deal of love to both Lilly and Alexis and tell them I often think of them both with much affection and truly it does seem a long long time since we parted with them.  I do hope the stay will do you all a great deal of good-  I am afraid you have missed some of our letters Chell and I both misunderstood and have been directing our letters to Brown-Shipley & Co Liverpool - and I am afraid they have not forwarded them-  I wrote not long ago a letter to thee and one to Lilly and Alexis enclosing a photograph of the baby to each-  If they have never come to hand I will send you another-  Harry has at last made up his mind to return to Minneapolis - he expects to start next fourth day.  I hope he will have a more prosperous time the coming year than he has had the last-  Upon looking over the forepart of this letter which I wrote a week ago I find I have mentioned about the building at Haverford in that so thee will please excuse my telling it again-  I dont feel like rewriting the letter-  Chell sends her love to you all in which I join and wish you "a merry Christmas" and "a happy New Year"-  I remain thy
   loving brother

   My own dear wife
   
   Anna and Hazen arrived home yesterday in good condition and as Anna wrote to mother yesterday I will not go into details of the journey or arrival.  They were however the [---] of various testimonials of love to me so that I feel quite rich.  Dear little children how sweet it was of them, however I am going to write each of them a letter either today or tomorrow.  I am ever so much obliged dearest for thy letter-  I am so glad to hear that Algie seems so much better and hope he will continue to improve-  I am glad thee is not pressing the Cod Liver oil as I am afraid it will upset his stomach and thus do more harm than good.  When thee writes tell me what the Dr thinks of his condition.  I am more and more inclined to think he caught the disease from Edward.
   
   We have been to meeting this morning and had sermons from E. Allen and W Kite and a prayer from Sarah Johnson.  The meeting was small.  We brought Cousin Anna Rhoads home with us as she was all alone-  Cousin James having gone to New Hope to spend First day.  Hazen and Anna expect to go over to Cousin C Hartshorne to tea this evening.  We are getting along very nicely dearest and thee need not feel the least concerned about.  I am really very comfortable and as to health am much better I have a good appetite in fact I expect I eat too much for my dyspepsia - which however is better - And now dearest I want to tell thee that I am sorry I said what I did at Newport-  I know my natural tendency is when everything goes along smoothly to settle down build castles in thr air and enjoy this world and I have no doubt that I need to be [---] more and more from this world and that our loving and merciful Heavenly Father breaks up my rest and [---] this world's pleasures that I may look beyond and have my heart fixed on Heaven and Heavenly things -  Our Heavenly Father does not willingly affect and if it only has the effect intended it will be but one of the light affliction which last but for a moment-  Therefore my dearest pray that I may grow better and better - I reallylong that such may be the case but the flesh is very weak.  I feel as our dear children are growing up I should be a better example to them -  So dearest do not worry about me but try and get well and strong-  I think of thee very very often with the tenderest love and pray that we may grow together in best things which I know will make us happen and happen in each other and in out Children.  Farewell dearest.  Give my love to Mother and Aunt Mary and the [---] abd with lots for thy own dear self 
      I am thy loving husband

  Dear Mother
  
  Aunt Mary received thy letter this morning or rather we did as we all read it first & then gave it to aunt Mary.  Cousin Charles & Carry & cousin Ellie Yarnall arrived last night or rather this morning, as the boat didnt get in till after 5 o'clock, consequently they were so tired that they are not going to get up till dinner time.  they could not get any state rooms & had to take berths so were very sick.  We took cousin Becky Howell & Annie out riding yesterday afternoon over to the three beaches & had a splendid time & got a good many shells, then in the evening we went out rowing on the bay with Eddie Howell & uncle H (the former makes a pretty good [bean?]) in the moonlight & sought the waves of the steam boats coming in, it was splendid, Lilly tried to row a little, but did not succeed very well.  Tell Aunt Annie I am going to get the story of the Haunted House fresh from Hannah Williams & Lilly or I will write it to her if she wants to know it very badly.  We were very glad to hear that you have cooler weather at home it must have been very hot - (pardonme, mamma) but it is only a slip of the tongue, I have in vain looked for hot in thy letters it's only "excessively warm."  Tell Hazen, Anna says she is going to bring home some shells to him & she wants him to answer her letter to him as soon as possible.  Aunt Mary sends her love & says she thinks she feels a little stronger though she don't attempt to walk far.  Anna wants me to tell Franky that some of the shells she is going to bring him are called boats & if he will put them in water they will float.

  Dear Sister-
  Chellie received thy letter at the dinner table to day, but feels rather disinclined to write in the few minutes we have to spare before going to ride.  We had a fine South West wind yesterday and again to day so that the surf at the bathing beach was first rate this morning.  Charles and Carry, Elly and our party with two ladies from this house made a [load?] for the omnibus and we all enjoyed the sight and sound of the beaches very much, but Henry, Jimmie, Elly, and Lilly, were the only ones to go in.  they had a splendid bath they said.  H. unfortunately is deaf in one ear since and does not feel quite well so I doubt their going in tomorrow unless C. escorts them - and he has the rheumatism - Charly thinks Newport air is all sufficient without bathing.-  H. says I have no time to write as the carriage will be here.  Chelly is quite well, and all the rest.  aff thy sister Mary
  Love to Frank and the children. P.S. Dear Frank - In writing my review which is on hand, I want to make sure of a word I think wrongly used in the book review, and have no dictionary here.  Will thee please look in your Imperial Dictionary, - or the Text of the Iconographic (Anatomical part) & send me word, if found, in your next letter, whether there are not two words, ilium and ileum,

  Dear Mother
  
  Aunt Mary received thy letter this morning or rather we did as we all read it first & then gave it to aunt Mary.  Cousin Charles & Carry & cousin Ellie Yarnall arrived last night or rather this morning, as the boat didnt get in till after 5 o'clock, consequently they were so tired that they are not going to get up till dinner time.  they could not get any state rooms & had to take berths so were very sick.  We took cousin Becky Howell & Annie out riding yesterday afternoon over to the three beaches & had a splendid time & got a good many shells, then in the evening we went out rowing on the bay with Eddie Howell & uncle H (the former makes a pretty good [bean?]) in the moonlight & sought the waves of the steam boats coming in, it was splendid, Lilly tried to row a little, but did not succeed very well.  Tell Aunt Annie I am going to get the story of the Haunted House fresh from Hannah Williams & Lilly or I will write it to her if she wants to know it very badly.  We were very glad to hear that you have cooler weather at home it must have been very hot - (pardonme, mamma) but it is only a slip of the tongue, I have in vain looked for hot in thy letters it's only "excessively warm."  Tell Hazen, Anna says she is going to bring home some shells to him & she wants him to answer her letter to him as soon as possible.  Aunt Mary sends her love & says she thinks she feels a little stronger though she don't attempt to walk far.  Anna wants me to tell Franky that some of the shells she is going to bring him are called boats & if he will put them in water they will float.  Love to papa, Alfred, Nannie & all at home & believe me thy loving daughter

Newport, 8th mo., 18th. 1867.

Dear Father
I   thought I would write to thee this afternoon, in case I   should not get a chance before the steamer leaves.  Not that   I’m so very busy, but since I lie down every noon when I get   home from bathing in time, and in the evenings we have Mary   Williams’ lamp incased in the same little plain bonnet so   that we have no chance either to write or read after dark,   unless we take a lamp and go up stairs.  
On 6th day we   ordered the boat, but were not able to go out, on account of   the rain.  In the morning Alfred had the pleasure of   witnessing a little sail boat upset, the man who was in it   managed to get on the bottom untill a sail boat came to his   assistance.  In the afternoon the rain slackened some and we   made up quite a large party and hired the omnibus to go to   the south Shore and see if the horn spouted, we had George   and thecarriage beside.  When we got there the horn did not spout   at all, but the waves were very fine, and towards the latter   part of the time, when the sun came out, very beautiful the   sun shone on the spray making nearly half of a rainbow.  We   staid till quite late stopping on the way home at the   boathouse, the sea there was not nearly so fine though.  On   seventh day morning we made up a small fishing expedition,   consisting of Alf, Hazen, Tom Longstreth, George and myself.   We went about a mile above the poor house anchoring in a   little cove near the rail-road.  We had quite good luck, and   caught about 24 fish, including 2 star fish, several   Chaucksus, and one very fat eel, which I had the   gratification of catching.  Since we have been here we have   seen two very curious fish, one called an “old maid,” which   is about 1 foot long and white underneath; the other is a   “swell fish,” and looks very much like other fish, except   when you turn it over and rub it gentlyit becomes inflated and is puffed out like a small   air-baloon, it is about 6 inches long.  The fishermen on the   point have had a reading room and small library established   for their benefit in a back room looking out on the bay at   “Godderds,” (I don[t] know whether I have spelt it right or   not, but if thee pronounces it the way its spelt thee will   know where I mean) by a Miss or Mrs. Gibbs.  They take the   daily and some of the illustrated papers, and I noticed a   number of the “British Gardiner” I think it was on the   table.  Well to come to the point at once; uncle Harry was   invited to deliver a sort of a lecture to them on last 6th   day evening.  George Merrit seemed very desirous that the   ladies would come up and hear the discourse, which some of   them did.  The speech was very grand the subject being   “Water,” I dont know whether the fishermen properly   appreciated it, since I heard one remark afterwards that,   “it wouldtake a purty smart man to follow him.”  I believe uncle   Harry proposes to deliver some more during this week on   Light and Air.  20th 3rd day.  Yesterday we took a sail over   to the Dumplings and landed those that wanted to, the rest   of us going on down, towards Bever Tail.  This morning we   proposed sailing around Canonicut, recruits came in slowly   since they had been all finished by the expedition to the   Light ship, however as it turned out there was not enough   wind and we had to defer it untill tomorrow, and go bathing   instead.  This afternoon mother contemplates going sailing   if George thinks we are not going to have a squall; at   present it looks very much like rain.  I suppose Mother has   told thee all about the storm they have been having at home.   I hope we’ll not have it here.  And now since I have used up   my sheet I will stop.  affecty thy son

Dear father
I rec’d   thy letter 5th day morning.  Thy accounts quite make me wish   to see England some time although I dont know that that time   will ever come.  On 4th day we sailed round Canonicut, and   since Lilly says she has given thee a condensed account of   our trip, I will copy our log by way of variety.  The   officers were: Capt. Geo. F Merritt, 1st mate T.P. Cope Jr   2nd mate A Cope Jr; Seaman T.K. Longstreth, Cabin boy F.H.   Cope.  Steward M. C Collins.  Cook V. Hartshorne and 6   passengers, A Newhall, M Newhall, M Farnum, H Carter, M.   Collins, & E.S. Cope.
Log of the Canonicut Party – Yacht   “TCope [Deferred]”
(Rations limited)
Started from the   pier at 8 1/2, A.M., arrived at the lighthouse at 8.40.   there met M.C. Cope and party in a row boat, who wished us   joy,and desired us to report all new discoveries; soon after we   commenced telling fortunes.  2 m. of 9 o’clock saw a   porpoise on the starboard side.  9.22. off fort Adams,   weather, calm, thin canopy of clouds, at this moment it was   proposed to “put more steam on.”  Three persons forward of   the “Lobster Box.”  progress, “slow but awfully sure.”  10.   o’clock, interesting information concerning the compass, by   Capt. Merritt.  surf seen at Bever Tail, fears entertained   for the health of the party.  Some excitement caused by the   appearance of two fish, which produced restlessness on the   part of the cabin boy –  10.11. opposite the Dumplings.  11   o’clock opposite Castle Hill the game of quintettes played   with interest by the 1st mate, cook, and several of the   passengers; the steward seiged with headache – at this time   doubts were expressed by the captain as to the probability   of the winds changing before 6 P.M. weather still calm.  [8]   m after 11. met a sailing vessel commanded by captain Henry   Merritt, rowed by the capt. and sculled by Henry Merritt jr   who hailed us, and threw a small lobster into the boat one   of the passengers was badly bitten which caused great   excitement untill she was rescued from the jaws of the   carnivorous creature.  11 1/2 A.M. Slight windthe South and visible, stood off to welcome it.  Party   regaled themselves with rations. 12. M. South wind   continues.  candy handed.  Met a schooner and were saluted   by a dog on board.  Long swells, health good.  12.10.   conversation on the weather prohibited– a number of the   passengers retired to rest – Cabin boy reclining on a   passenger–  cook on the dinner basket–  1st mate absorbed in   a book.  12.45. Point Judith lighthouse in sight.  After   serious consideration it was decided to pursue our journey   on which account three cheers were given.  12.50. Passing   Bever Tail.  three more cheers – passengers happy – saluted   by the horn and a towel was waved to us, which compliment   was returned passengers waving handkerchiefs.  2. P.M.   Dinner – great dispute on the subject of ringing the   triangle.  2.45. from “Lobster Box” end–  dinner   accomplished satisfactorily leaving the voyagers in a   quiescent state of mind–  dinner consisted of 9 courses   closed with sour-drops–  opposite M. Williams’- Bay   comparatively speaking very rough!  Fast passing Wickford –   Slight excitement Fortunes being told again aft. The 1st   mate has just restored the cabin to order, after dinner.    Aft becoming very impudent.  Bow hair dressing.  1st matesweeping and thereby discomboberating all – 2.55. Patience   in sight.  sentiment in the bow, 3.12. Approaching the end   of Canonicut Greenwich off the larboard bow.  Patience and   Rocky Pt. ahead.  the breeze delightful, and all of the   party very comfortable, some reading, some working zephyr   work.  3.20. Rounding the north end of Canonicut.  Three   cheers given by all the party.  3.35. P.M. Rounding   Canonicut.  Newport in view – on our homeward trip – breeze   good.  some of the party wishing to land we are going to (we   did’nt) 3.38. Met the Providence steamboat- Needless anxiety   on the part of the passengers.  Now dashing gaily towards   Newport.  3.55 Proceeding fondly – just played games of   authors and consequences.  3 m. of 5.P.M. off the   Lighthouse. health good.  Fine breeze- Band tuning up for a   song before we reach the pier.  Arrived at the pier at   5.P.M.  On first day evening we took a walk to Tammany Hill.   we started after a 6 o’clock tea but were not able to get   there untill dark or dusk.  It is the first time I was ever   there.  We saw the lights at Point Judith, the Light Ship,   Bever Tail and the Break water.  Yesterday was splendidlyclear.  In the morning we took a short float, I cant call it   a sail there wasn’t any wind, after which we went bathing.    In the afternoon I made up a small sailing party consisting   of Alice Carter, Abby Newhall, Tom Longstreth and Alfred, we   went out to the Dumplings and landed, & afterwards came back   to take Caroline Mary her first sail.  She could’nt have had   a more pleasant evening it neither too cold nor too warm, &   there was a splendid breeze.  We went around Rose Island and   got back in good season.  though not strictly obeying her   mothers instructions about being home at half past 6.  This   morning we went bathing as usual and also engaged the boat,   Alfred preferring to go to Coddingtons Cove to bathing.    Thee will observe that I’ve been getting about as much good   out of boating as possible this season.  Since we arrived   Alf has become a staunch friend of Geo. Merritt’s and Hazen   of Geo. Barlow’s. Its quite remarkable how devoted Alf is,   he spends the big parts of his time at the reading room with   George.  This morning I got a new key fitted, formy valise, having lost the other since my arrival.  We were   not able to mail these letters in time to go by the [La---]   so they will have to take their chance by going via New   York.  There are 24 folks going to Philadelphia the night we   go, which will make a pretty effectual change in Mary   Williams’ boarders, and there will be no one left but Tom   Longstreth to do the honors of the occasion.  We are rather   puzzled as to what to do if we were left by the 7 o’clock   train from New York, since the 10 o’clock train has been   taken off the line.  We will have to run the risk, I   suppose, of getting the 8.40, Washington train, stopped at   Frankford.  Having run out of news and since mother is also   writing I will stop.

Title: 1831 August 1, Philadelphia, to Sister

Philada 8th. mo 1st. 1831

I dare say, my dear sister,   thee has felt inclined since we parted, sometimes, to apply   to me the old adage with regard to promising people vis.   that, 
“A ready maker
Is a ready breaker:”
since   the offer to write to thee was entirely voluntary on my   part, and yet I have suffered two weeks, nearly, to pass   without making an effort to fulfil my engagement.- As usual,   I am rich in excuses--the most prominent of which, is the   impossibility I found in obtaining a certain direction to my   letter; and either imagining the epistle, when completed,   would be too valuable to be thrown away, or else deeming, (I   did not stop to analyze feelings), my time too precious to   be expended upon that which would profit my correspondant   nothing, I concluded to defer writing altogether, until   Henry came up to this, our quarterly   solemnity.---

And now, having got thro’ the most   important and generally most stupid part of epistolary   communications, vis. the preface, let me dash at once into   my stock of news, and  cull for thy benefit such pieces of   information as will be likely to interest thee. I greatly   fear the selection will be a small one, for summer is a   particularly unsocial season, unless it is with our most   intimate friends and of course, we hear but little of what   is passing in
the world without.- I suppose thee will say it is respecting   the movements of friends thee would wish to be informed; and   if they would only do something, in the least degree, and of   the common line, I should take great pleasure in   transmitting an account of it to thee; but they are all   pursuing their usual routine of occupations, enjoying   themselves in a most provoking state of quiescence, and   doing and saying nothing that would give use to any   comments.----- Maryann tarried about two weeks at [Calcon]-   Hook, and she says passed her time very pleasantly,   notwithstanding the ungracious sounds, issuing from young   master Frank’s mouth, which occasionally saluted her   maidenly ears.-- I believe she could say, very pathetically,   “I am never merry when I hear such music,” she thinks, I   imagine, that we need never apprehend consumption in the   case of our little nephew, adopting, as I opine she does,   Anna Braithwaites favorite maxim that all our faculties,   bodily as well as mental, may be “strengthened by reason of   use”.-- Father, Mother, the aforenamed cousin, and myself,   spent a day with Caroline not long since.-- She seems quite   comfortable and very well; she is fattening on cottage   cheese and “lovely, rich cream.” and fortifying her bodily   powers by riding frequently on horse-back- Her darling son   looks admirably, walks boldly  alone and chatters at a most   rapid rate.* [Note at bottom edge of page: “lest thee should   be led into the mistake of supposing him, even a more   marvellous child than he really he is, I must state that his   conversations are carried on in a language peculiar to   himself, and are quite unintelligible to ordinary   hearers----“] I must do him the justice to say that he   behaved himself very gentlemanly during the whole period of   our visit and struttedabout in his apron of thy purchasing, (with which, by the   bye, he is delighted), with quite the air of a person of   importance---------

We had a considerable collection   of friends at our mansion during the whole time of the   conference—Jeremiah Hubard and his wife, two female friends   from Providence, and cousin A. Barker lodged with us, and   they attracted others during the day—so that we had a real   miniature yearly meeting-- With the consignment from your   house, we were all, I believe, much amused—Oh! if thee had   but been present at the relation of their courtship given by   the husband, and heard the gentle, deprecatory tone in which   the wife endeavored to ward off the narration, & the very   singular intonation of her voice in her exclamations of “oh,   Jeremiah, now dont”!! It was absolutely irresistible!—She   has now gone with “cousin [Nat]” to visit her relations in   Virginia, and her better half has taken refuge from the   intolerable heat of our city, at Joel Woolman’s.—Now this, I   should say was “a bitter change, severer for severe,” for a   more exposed, comfortless-looking country dwelling I have   seldom seen than the residence of this same   milkman.--------

I hope the purchases I have made for   thee will prove satisfactory—the cambric, I procured as   nearly like Henry’s cravat as I could.—Do take notice of the   beautiful picture on the cologne water bottle.- I have often   heard of the angel of health coming with healing in his   --
wings, but the idea of being kicked into “salubrity” (to use   Caleb’s phrase), is quite novel, and from the position in   which the ministering spirit here stands, I should suppose   the virtue lay in his heels—Uncle Jaspar’s family have been   very regularly heard from.—Abbeyann is much better but   Uncle’s eye still continues bad and they fear he will be   obliged to have an operation performed when they reach   Cincinnati.- I saw Martha on sixth day and never saw her   look better--- Mother is somewhat improved—She and Father   have at last fixed upon this week for leaving home.- the   latter part of it I expect.—Mary Stokes is added to the   party---- I have almost filled my sheet and have not said a   word about the fire we had had—It was “horribly beautiful”   but terribly allarming 

Rachel R. Cope
DealI must refer thee to Henry for particulars.---- I am glad to  hear the boys areenjoying themselves-- Give my love to them and tell them not  to be tooventuresome.-- I dislike apologies about letters, but in  looking over this I cannotbut be struck with the triffling nature of its  contents.—However, the weather is too warm to be  intellectual, even supposing I had it in my power, and it is  only on rare occasions that I am sentimental. Such as it is,  I hope thee will deem it worthy an early reply to thy  attached sister

do not want thee at home till thee gets better--and get   along pretty well without thee, I don't suppose Aunt Rachel   fares quite so well as if thee were here--but I do try to do   my best--Cousin Elizbt's letter of last eving told thee she   was'nt quite well--she is some better to-day--and I hope   tomorrow will be better still--(Oh my! There--I've actually   fallen asleep over my letter--thee wont feel much   complimented I'm afraid) Tell Clemmy we got her first   letter--and think we are very remiss not to have   ex[patiated] on its sweetness for [-]

George   sends his love--and I expect the folks generally would,

Farewell--I'm so dreadfully   sleepy--thine Julie--

Oh my!

May   He put his unfailing arms around you and give you His   Strength and His Comfort and His brave peace. And I know He   will.

My Dear aunt

I expect this   will be the last letter I shall write to thee this session   as the time is drawing near when we shall go home.  we are   now reviewing and it is not so hard as I expected it would   be  we have to be very industrious [about] our studies as   some of them are very hard particularly the history and I am   very much afraid I shall fail in that at examination as the   greater part of it I have not learned for I have not been in   that class, all the session.  Thomas Kite’s wife is here   spending a day or two and her daughter also.  I suppose thee   has heard of the little boy who has been so ill here he was   taken with the measles and that layed the foundation for the   consumption and after suffering for a long time he was taken   away at three o clock in the morning of the first of spring    we had no school on six or seventh day but we all went to   our school rooms and red our bibles and on seventh day   morning we were taken into see his corpse and he was buried on seventh day afternoon   his name was Nathan Comstock and he was an orphan he lived   in Lockport New York  he has a brother and sister here and   his sister is a lovely girl but I know very little about his   brother.  Benjamin Sharpless was here to thee funeral and he   asked me if I had ever seen him at Tommy Cope’s and I told   him no., but I have often heard of him.  I am looking for   uncle Samuel to come and see me as he has been away so long   and I think he might come to see me this session
Aunt   Lydia is not at all well she has a very bad cold and a good   deal of pain in that lump on her face and she keep her bed   the greater part of the day but she is rathe better at   present than she has been lately  I think she would of been   better if she had not of gone down to supper last night   through the cold entry.  I have some things to write for and   I do not think I shall have any more time to write to thee.    Cousin L sends her respects to all of you. but I send my   love to all be lieve me as ever thy affectionate   niece

Laurel House
7th mo. 28th. 1867.

Dear Father
Lilly and Chelly having been keeping up such an active correspondence by the last two steamers, I thought I would reserve my efforts untill they had got through. 
We received a letter from uncle Tom inclosing a letter from thee informing us of the loss of thy masticators, it      would have been remarkably unfortunate if thee had not had      an extra set with thee.  I hope by this time thee is      enjoying thyself on terra firma, but since the difference of      time between where thee is and where we are is so great, we      find it hard to guess what thee is about.  We received letters from home last night, dated the 25th., saying they   were all well and preparing to leave for Newport on 5th day.   Mother had also received a letter from thee mailed at   Halifax
On last 6th day we rode to Stony Clove, an   entirely new place to me, about 10 miles distant.  The road   is quite rough, and runs between two mountains, one of which   rises almost perpendicularly about 1000 ft, as near as we   could judge, and on each side there are large rocks under   which we found ice: they say the sun never gets there and   the ice under the rocks never melts during the summer.  On   approaching this place the air becomes perceptably cooler   and on leaving it becomes warm again.  We took dinner at a   little farm house and although it was plain weenjoyed it very much.  After dinner we had to leave right   away for home.  Going back we had a splendid view of those   distant mountains you see on your way to the Plauterkill   Clove.
Yesterday morning we, that is Tom Stokes, Harry,   some other gentlemen and myself, walked down to Bastion   Falls to take a bath, thee remembers what a fine basin there   is at the foot of the falls, well it was there we went in;   the water was pretty cool on first going in but after we had   been in a little while, and had kicked around a good bit we   got quite warm and all in a glow.  We went under the fall   where it hit the rocks for a second time, but even there the   water stung like hail-stones, and I preferredthe pool to getting such a warming as that.  In the      afternoon we walked over to the Mountain House to see the      view, on starting it was beautifully clear but when we had      gone about half way, two clouds, very considerately, came      rolling down upon us, one from North and one from South      mountain, and by the time we got to the precipice both the      view and ourselves were completely mistified; we accordingly      went into the House and got weighed, and since thee will not      object to hearing how much some of the members of thy      immediate family weigh, I will give thee part of the      table:
R.R.C.  125 lbs.   E.S.C.  98 lbs.   T.P.C.  90      lbs.     Rachel has gained 7 lbs. since last sum- mer, and its becoming quite dreadful; I'm afraid, if she      goes on gaining, we will be obliged to have her put up in a      barrel and roll her home from Newport.  Tom Stokes, Ellie,      Madjie, and Walter are going home tomorrow morning: the rest      of us expect to leave here fourth day and go to Albany, we      will stay there that night, and go to Boston the next day;      leaving Boston 6th. day afternoon we will arrive at Newport      in time for tea.  I suppose mother has told thee that she      succeeded in engaging both the Georges during our stay      there.  The weather here has been very warm and showery; to      day it is very pleasant but it has been so very showery we      were afraid to try going to walk. Aunt Lizzie received two letters from the Adirondacks to      day one from cousin Clemmy and one from aunt Annie, giving      an account of a trip which they had taken to lake Placid by      the way of John Brown's grave; aunt Annie said the grave was      very plain, there was a tombstone with some engraving on it      and on a boulder nearby was the plain inscription "John      Brown - 1859."  She also said cousin Clemmy was a good deal      stronger and was able to bear fatigue as well as the rest of      them  They were both very much surprised to hear of thy      sudden leaving for England.  Lilly and Chelly send their      love.  We are all well and have had a most splendid time      considering that our "pa" is on the other side of the Atlantic and now having given thee   all the news I can remember I will   stop.
affectionately
thy son Thos P. Cope Jr

He has beguiled some of the hours of his confinement      in doors, by reading “Rollo’s vacation” to me – & we have      found it quite entertaining –  I think it arrived just at      the right moment –  So much for Thomas –.  now for Willie –      with whom I am becoming better acquaintedas the ice is now broken – & he frequently pays us a visit      in our parlor –  He tells me – he is more comfortable than      formerly – & that the cause of his unhappiness is re-moved –      what this cause was, I do not know – but he looks so      pleasant & happy that I am inclined to believe he is not      depressed by any great weight of troubles –  They are very      different boys but both have found means to interest me      warmly for them – & I think I shall not soon cease to love      them – Tom is sitting by me begging me to proceed – but the      end of my paper warns me that I may already have tired thee      – therefore will take the hint after desiring my love to thy      mother – and assuring thee of

I      promised thy little brother to add a postscript to his      letter, inasmuch as he thought he should be unable to fill      the sheet – but he has left me so much room that I believe I      shall have to call in William’s aid to clothe the preceding      page –  Thos. has been in the parlor for a day or two, in      consequence of a bruise he has received on his eye –  It was      occasioned entirely by an accidental blow from a stick in      the hand of one of his companions, & seem’d at first rather      disposed to be troublesome – but by a faithful application      of lead-water yesterday it is nearly recovered – so nearly      that it occasions no inconvenience, & is but slightly      discoloured –  He seems to think that eye is particularly      unfortunate, as it is the same one which was hurt some time      ago –  I do not think thy mother need feel uneasy about it,      as we shall try to take all necessary care of him, if any      more is needed –  In regard to being careful himself, he      needs some few cautions, tis true – but I will tell it to      his credit, that for an active, adventurous little boy he is      very well disposed to take advice – & when he makes promises      to adopt it, is, I believe, very scrupulous in fulfilling      them.  He has beguiled some of the hours of his confinement      in doors, by reading “Rollo’s vacation” to me – & we have      found it quite entertaining –  I think it arrived just at      the right moment –  So much for Thomas –.  now for Willie –      with whom I am becoming better acquaintedas the ice is now broken – & he frequently pays us a visit      in our parlor –  He tells me – he is more comfortable than      formerly – & that the cause of his unhappiness is re-moved –      what this cause was, I do not know – but he looks so      pleasant & happy that I am inclined to believe he is not      depressed by any great weight of troubles –  They are very      different boys but both have found means to interest me      warmly for them – & I think I shall not soon cease to love      them – Tom is sitting by me begging me to proceed – but the      end of my paper warns me that I may already have tired thee      – therefore will take the hint after desiring my love to thy      mother – and assuring thee of

Dear sister

I hope you are      all well, My cold is quite well.  Freind Mary Davis sends      her love to Mother.  I am glad to hear that Aunt Ann is so      much better and, I hope that she will continue so, and I am      glad also that thee is getting well enough to walk out  How      is Aunt Hannah and uncle Thos, and Harry  Where is Williams      slipers  I think ought to be done.  It snowed last night      there a little.  The green house is nearly finished but the      plants are not yet aranged. we have had some pretty good      sleding.

I      promised thy little brother to add a postscript to his      letter, inasmuch as he thought he should be unable to fill      the sheet – but he has left me so much room that I believe I      shall have to call in William’s aid to clothe the preceding      page –  Thos. has been in the parlor for a day or two, in      consequence of a bruise he has received on his eye –  It was      occasioned entirely by an accidental blow from a stick in      the hand of one of his companions, & seem’d at first rather      disposed to be troublesome – but by a faithful application      of lead-water yesterday it is nearly recovered – so nearly      that it occasions no inconvenience, & is but slightly      discoloured –  He seems to think that eye is particularly      unfortunate, as it is the same one which was hurt some time      ago –  I do not think thy mother need feel uneasy about it,      as we shall try to take all necessary care of him, if any      more is needed –  In regard to being careful himself, he      needs some few cautions, tis true – but I will tell it to      his credit, that for an active, adventurous little boy he is      very well disposed to take advice – & when he makes promises      to adopt it, is, I believe, very scrupulous in fulfilling      them.  He has beguiled some of the hours of his confinement      in doors, by reading “Rollo’s vacation” to me – & we have      found it quite entertaining –  I think it arrived just at      the right moment –  So much for Thomas –.  now for Willie –      with whom I am becoming better acquaintedas the ice is now broken – & he frequently pays us a visit      in our parlor –  He tells me – he is more comfortable than      formerly – & that the cause of his unhappiness is re-moved –      what this cause was, I do not know – but he looks so      pleasant & happy that I am inclined to believe he is not      depressed by any great weight of troubles –  They are very      different boys but both have found means to interest me      warmly for them – & I think I shall not soon cease to love      them – Tom is sitting by me begging me to proceed – but the      end of my paper warns me that I may already have tired thee      – therefore will take the hint after desiring my love to thy      mother – and assuring thee of

I want very much to see you, I hope you   will come and pay us a visit, I am still Favoured with   Health, and that you may enjoy that Blessing is the Desire   of your affectinate Grandmother
Rachel DrinkerDear Cousins

Our dear Grandmother is Kind enough to   permit me to add a few lines to her letter–  I wish it was   in my power to communicate to you something that would   afford pleasure.  But alas!  I have lived to see the   melancholy period that death has seperated from me one of   the best of mothers, whose affection I believe I possessed;   and that I loved her with sincere affection, affords me no   small share of consolation–  She suffered much during her   illness, but such was her Christian fortitude that she never   discovered the least impatience, and constantly maintained   her usual cheerful serenity of mind, which was her   characteristic through a life of trials.  It was painful to   see her suffer so much bodily pain, but infinitly more so to   see her breath her last, a[l]though she suffered not the   pangs of death, but passed from this terrestrial world to   one where peace, happiness and pleasure reign triumphantly;   and where she now enjoys the blissful harvest of a spotless   and well spent life–  Such has been the immutable decree of   heaven to deprive me of an affectionate Mother and you an   affectionate Aunt– We are still blest with having our dear   Grandmother to cheer us–  She enjoysher usual health, which I hope she may enjoy for years to   come–
The last letter we received from Arthur states that   he and Cousin Henry are both well, and expect to leave the   West Indies very shortly; we of course expect them   daily–
Uncle is at present in good health, and I hope   will long continue so; here I must close this short epistle   and hope that I will see you before long –  I remain your   affectionate

1st day eve

My dear   Mother

I had to leave off writing very suddenly last   time, as thee must have seen by the letter having no   direction.  We got to writing in bed at West Point as we   woke up early, & were not going to take breakfast till 8   1/2; but we had to go at 9 1/2, & as we were very pokey we   did not get down to breakfast till 9 o’clock-hence my great   hurry.  We left West P. in the boat, the rest of the way up   the Hudson was not however nearly so interesting, we soon   got out of the Highlands & then it seemed very tame.  This   is the most magnificent place we were ever, or are likely   ever, to be in; The view from the front of the house is very   extencive & beautifulfrom one place we can see the top of Mount Washington with   the opera glass.  The house is quite a large one tho’ mostly   old fashioned except the parlor wh. is up stairs, & has I   think most probably been altered the passages are the most   intricate I ever was in, & sometimes I feel completely lost.   We are on the very top of the mountain with dreadful   prespicise’s all around us, & it is the most dreadful place   to get up to that ever was, thee knows its a twelve miles   drive up the mountain from the landing, & how long does thee   ’spose we were getting up? 5 1/2 hours- just think of it the   horses walked nearly all the way, & stoped ever few   minut[e]s to rest; after we got fairly to the foot of the   mountain within about three miles from the house father &   Tom got out to walk, “& the consequence was” they got here   an hour & a quarter before us.the last part of the way poor Rach, was dreadfully sick, the   boat & stage together were too much for her, & as soon as we   got there I helped her get right to bed, she slept pretty   well however after she once did get to sleep tho’ she   suffered dreadfully poor child, thee knows her headaches are   so hard to bear, but don’t worry she’s quite well to day.    This morning they had service in the parlor to wh. Cous.   Clem, Chell & I went with papa’s leave. the sermon was   pretty good & I must confess I think it much better that   poking round all 1st day & going no where, if you can’t go   to meeting go to church – “thems my sentiments.”  After   service we all went out to take a ramble & after a good deal   of hunting round for paths & scrambling up them when found,   we at last arrivedat the top of South Mountain It was a beautiful walk   although it seemed to scare poor aunt Annie terribly to see   us so near the edge of these awful prespicise’s wh. surround   us every where; the rocks covered with ferns, mosses,   litgens are really beautiful.  We passed through what they   call “[Pudding]–stone Hall” a large cleft in the rocks   formed of pudding–stone & also through the lemon-squeezers   another crevise.  We are altogether enjoying ourselves very   much I think & propose staying here till 3rd day afternoon   when we will probably leave for Saratog[a], & thence to Lake   George.  at least those are present prospects but as we have   changed our plans several times to day I wont say certainly,   if we p[u]rsue the plan now proposed wewill stop at Belloes Falls on our way to Boston & spend   next 1st day at Nahant if we can.  We have rather a funny   time altogether about our meals & sleeping apartments here   things are not extremely clean, & it is so crowded we have   to come to the second table & therefore have to take our   breakfast at ten & dinner at four & now about 6 the supper   bell has rung, but I ‘spose we’ll come second class there   to.  We are quite glad of our thick dresses Mother, & have   worn nothing else hardly since we left home.  its right cold   to night, & we have to wear shawls & things all the time to   keep warm.  It is getting almost to dark for me towrite any more dear Mother so I think the[e] must let me   close.  I hope we shall hear from home tomorrow we want to   hear very much how you all are.  I shall try to write soon   again if we get to a stopping place  we have been going so   steadily that there has been hardly any time to do any   thing, but see the sights  Please excuse all defects – &   with love to all I am
ever thy loving

Dear Uncles
Thomas & Joshua Pim   /

I wrote to my Bror. John &c the 17th. of last mo:   aqt.ing them of a great alteration in my ffamily, wch.   letter I supose went in a ship just then ready to sail to   Ireland and now I acquaint you that it hath pleased Divine   Providence to remove my wife from me by Death,  She was   taken Ill of (that Dreadfull distemper) the smallpox about   the 4th. of last moth: & departed in the night between the   14th. & 15th. of ye. same being Sorely afflicted wth. the   distemper, but verry sencible all the time & I hope made   good use of sd. time, often praying & praising God, & tho:   in the time of her health she did not seem as fully as I   cou’d a wisht to Joyn wth. ffrds.  (tho she- went to no   other worship that I know off since we came here but   severall times to ffriends meetings) yet in her Illness she   was desirous of the company of sollid ffrds & severall of   such did visit her & I think are generally in good hopes   that she Dyed in Peace & I believe few who knew her here   were streangers to her former circumstance for my part I did   not endeavour to conceall the truth from Honest ffriends,   and before I pesumed to appoint her buriall I requested   leave of ffriends to Bury her in their ground, which was soe   readily granted that they told me they thought it needless   to ask it, phaps you may desire to know wt. I recd of the   debt due to me I cannot say yt. I recd. none tho: (I thought   more was due,) for Just at last, she desired it might be   forgot or forgiven wch. I think implyed some acknowledgment    I think for above a year past she grew the most sollid &   sober yt. I have known her at all – & I cannot but admire   how much her loss is lamented in this neighbourhood, for she   was a verry oblieging neighbour & skillfull in many   things

I mentioned to my Bror. &c [---] [---] of the   Illness of my youngest Child, we thought it was dying the   next day after its mothers death, yet it continued for   fifteen days longer for the most pt. in great extremity &   then Died, wch. long Illness I believe helped to wean me   from it, soe that its Death did not affect me soe much as I   believe it wd. if it had a died soon, for it was a verry   pleasant Child, it was 7 months old when it fell   sick

I mentioned in a former letter to my Brother the   Death of my servant Jo: Gavin who was the first of my   ffamily who was taken Ill, & Died about a week or 6 days   before the next began my ffamily then consisted of 12 psons   (i:e: before this sickness) whereof 7 was to have it, & of   the 7: 3 is dead, wch. we may conclude was a great stroake,   tho: I may tell you that it does not yet seem soe hard for   me to bear as wt. I formerly bore, but the Death of my poor   wife seemd a greater exercise than I expected it wd. a been,   however I still endeavour to be patient & content wth. what   Providence permits to be my lot in this troublsom   world

I am through [meny] greatly favoured wth.   Health & my five Children are now pitty well tho: my Son   Thos. has had a hard time & a narrow escape with his life   thro: the smallpox

I have been verry well furnisht   with good neighbours during this trouble pticularly Thos.   M.cChuns wife (being a nurse) did not see her own house for   two weeks of the time of my poor Babes Illness,  I have this   comfort that my poor Children seems verry to’rdly, & my Dtr.   Sarah considering her age verry pitty as to her knowledge in   the way of Houskeeping, & on her and my maid Mary Turner.  I   think that pt. must pitty much depend at [pesant]

now   Dear Uncles I shall use some further freedom wth. you, this   Cheange in my ffamily ocasions many thoughts in my mind, one   whereof is to this purpose that since the cause of my   leaving you, my ffriends, & my native Country, is now   remov’d, why shou’d not I return there again, least I shou’d   be taken from my Children & they left more destitute a mong   streangers, but in answer to that, can I think that I should   be brought all the way to this remote pt. of the world for   no other end than to bury my wife, this Country I find more   agreeable to my Health (else it is wth. working harder) this   Country also is governed by more agreeable Laws than that   here are plenty of good ffriends (tho: not my near   Relations) who I believe wd. take care of my Children were I   taken from them, & phaps I may have opptunity to [---] be of   more servis here than there, & thu---] reasoni--] concerning   wch. I desire your sollid Consideration & answer as [---] as   PossibleHowever if you please to Inform me how the woolen trade is   now in Ireland & whether, I am freed from that holding wch.   I was liable to, I am as I mentioned to you before pitty   much Involvd. in Debt & do find it hard to pay Debts wth.   this way of living. corn being low & money scearce, but do   think my self now more at liberty than before to consider of   some other way of making my life Easier, but not by any   alteration soe suddenly as [y.] year

I desire a   pticular account of your [---] familys & my Cousin Wm.   Glaister & of our ffamily in Generall & of ffrds &   neighbours where any alteration has happen’d since my   leaving you,

Soe wth. Dear Love to you all I Conclude   your Loving nephew & affectionate ffriend

Wm   Pim

P:S: the Smallpox continues to spead over this   Country this being the 3d. time of its being here since   settled by the English, it mises but few ffamilyes, & takes   off many heads of familyes especially men in their prime,   here are many widdows now in this County  I am in   expectation of Ja: Nicholson in a little time [p] whom I   expect an act. from Irland & if he dont bring me a servant   or servants I shall be in great want for I am soe now, I   hired. an Indifferant hand lately at Husbandry & it Cost me   36s for 4 weeks (& diat) this has povd. a hard winter &   Spring [fother] is now verry scearce wth. many people but   mine holds out, tho: I lost one cow, yesterday & the night   before here fell a great Snow wch. seems streange to the   people,

My Dear Cousin
I suppose you   have through the medium of letters to some of our family   heard of us and our safe arrival in Europe, but in   compliance with thy request and my promise which has not   been forgotten, I thought (altho at a late period) a breif   sketch of our [pastimes] in our new location would be   acceptable hoping that you retain a feeling of interest in   our welfare.  We arrived in London after a short and   altogather pleasant voyage passed ten day’s there was   buisily engaged in visiting the many objects very   interesting to strangers, the Tower, Westminster Abbey, St   Paul’s, House of Lords, and various other places, We then   left; after a travel of four days thro an interesting   country we arrived at Paris, during which time we were all   favoured with health, and our children were very good   scarcely uttering a word of complaint of fatigue or any   thing else, this thee may well suppose enhanced our   pleasure, or at least diminished our difficulties, When we   arrived in Paris, we took posession of apartments engaged   for our reception in a French family who speak English,  the   family consists of this and five American families, who form   a pleasant domestic circle, they are all plainly disposed   people, some very interesting a Doctor Lowell with his wife   and daughter who have visited most of the countries of   Europe, Egypt, Palestine, are with us, English is spoken at   our table, this altho very pleasant retards our progress in   the acquisition of the french language,
We are situated   in Rue de Rivoli opposite theTuileries the garden annexed to the palace, the residence of   the royal family, our location is very pleasant, excepting   that we are in the fourth story of the house (this in   America would not be considered respectable) not so in Paris   the population is so great; that highly respectable and even   wealthy families occupy apartments, consisting of several   rooms on a level, so that a house (of course large) will   accommodate many families, a very small proportion of   residents occupying a house as we do in America, this I felt   to be a great abridgment of my domestic comfort
My   ignorance of the language and the uncertainty of our   continuance induces us to board, I do not wish to encumber   myself with domestic cares, for the management of a family   in Paris is attended by much care, for one who would not   choose to leave every thing to the regulation of servants,    There are several hundred Americans in Paris who form a   pleasant society, it is customary here for those who keep   house to set apart one evening in the week for the reception   of their freinds, who receive an invitation to visit them on   that evening whenever inclination dictates, this promotes   great sociability among those who meet, the simplicity of   the entertainment is to be admired, consisting generally of   a cup of tea and cake only, very seldom serving any other   refreshment, in other respects not so simple, as a great   regard is paid to personal appearance, Dress, Dress, seems   to engross their minds to the exclusion of other and better   considerations,
Our two daughters are at a school of high   repute and we think deservedly so, they are improving in   their studies,We have visited several churches, Catholic and protestant    This we feel to be a very great privation, to have no place   of worship to resort to in accordance with our own views   where we could commune with our own hearts and be still, but   we feel the necessity of recurring to the dictates of that   inward guide, which if obey’d will lead out of all error,    We have visited a great many of the places of interest to   strangers, there are many galleries of paintings very fine,   there is at this time an annual exhibition at the Louvre, of   new pieces, some private collections also
I have in my   silent musing’s in immagination revisited most of your   dwellings,  Dear Aunts Ruth and Margery very frequently   present themselves before me, when we left home they both   seemed feeble, I hope their lives may be prolonged to the   comfort of their children by whom they are surrounded, but   it seemed to me [that] the sun of their day was near   [setting] in a tranquil evening, if My Dear Cousin this   excites sufficient interest in thy breast to induce a reply,   information of them as well as many other members of our   family would be grateful to us who are situated so far from   many they still hold dear, please remember us affectionately   to them All,  Richard and Ruth, Caleb and Martha, Samuel   Henry, and thy children from thy attached Cousin

My very dear friends —

We have just finished   reading in the Montrose papers, which my daughter Annie   Sayne brought down to me this p.m. – the account of the   Dedication of dear Clemmie’s donation to all the people of   old Susq: Co: & under its inspiration I feel that I must   immediately x x x x –––––––––1908 Jan. 4th –

— To prove that my dear friends have   not been entirely forgotten, – I have the audacity to   continue this letter – begun so long ago as almost to be   forgotten unless it be for this purpose! –  An interruption   occurred, during which time Minnie told me that she was   writing or had written to you, & when I asked where she wd.   address it, she said "Oh, in c/o Misses Biddle – they are in   Montrose". —  I demurred, but neither of us knew theGermantown address & altho’ I said "No. 1. Walnut St."   always held a clue – & had for nearly 100 yrs. past, – but   she laughed, – said that date was obsolete, – & now I doubt   if you ever did get her letter! –  I wish I cd. see you, & I   think our tongues wd. travel fast, –  Writing has become   rather irksome to me, – particularly with pen & ink as my   fingers have very much stiffened in my old age – so I   generally write with a pencil(when I think my frds. will not   object,) & I do not write much, except to my two sons, – who   are in R.R.d business at Sydney,– Nova Scotia. —

— We   have had such a hard summer,– partly owing to the delusions   these conceited Virginians had,– that "all the world & his   wife" wd. almost break their necks to get here to see their   wonderful state & its historic surroundings – then their   disappointments & losses were not cheerful or conducive to   cheery letter writing, & I hate to write doleful letters. —If it were not so pathetic,– it wd. be very amusing to see   the downfall of the hopes they all had of making such   enormous fortunes.–  Hundreds & thousands of dollars have   been lost, for the whole thing was a complete fizzle & not   being completed until away into October, & therefore but   little attendance,– those who did come disparaging it, & the   day after the gates were closed, it was put right into the   hands of a receiver!! –  Virginia has not had such a   staggering blow since Appomattox! –

— We have seen   very little ofMiss Walcott altho we attend the same church, but she lives   at the farther side of our town & the trip involves a   trolley ride- a ferry across Hapton Creek & a walk to each   end of the line.-
I am so sorry to hear of Carrie’s   increased deafness, - & descouraged too.- for I have grown   very deaf myself. & when she had all the medical faculty of   Europe to consult, & they did not cure her, - it is not   worth while for me to try. - Is it hereditary with her?- I   don’t remember either of your parents beingafflicted in that way. –  The strongest point in my memory   about them – is your father’s good sound "orthodox" dignity   – always so cheerily smoothed over, by your Mother’s   beautiful almost angelic smile which brightened almost   everybody & everything around them. –  I don’t wonder he   went to bed, when she was taken from him, & could never be   persuaded to rise again. –  I must close this now for my   messenger to take to the post office. –

— How I do   wish you would come to see us.  I hardly know any one who   would be more welcome. –  Now, think it over & see if you   can’t come,– particularly if a cold wave strikes Germantown.   —

Good bye – in which both my girls join, – don’t   ever doubt me, but believe me always your loving &   affectionate friend
Sibylla T. Morris.

Locust Shade 11.18.1865

My Dear Annie

That   thy very interesting letter has thus long remained   unanswered has been that I have not very often thought of   thee, as I trust thee knowst- and I was much disappointed to   find that I had gone to Germantown a week too soon to see   thee. This to be sure I had but a few hours to stay there,   still I had hoped to spend part of them with thee.- I hope   dear Annie thee is better for thy sojourn at Newport. For I   know the return home without thy father’s welcome must have   been very painful.- even with all the love & kindness of thy   brothers & 
sisters and with the strong consolation thee has of   believing that thy dear parents are forever “where adieus   and farewells are a sound unknown”.- May we realize more &   more the infinite importance of eternal things.- For myself   I seem to glide on day after day occupied with a round of   duties, but in a kind of lethargy in regard to spiritual   things Certainly without that earnest striving which is   commanded & which we may believe is essential to Christian   progress- But confession of our faults avails little without   amendment & I should not burden the with mine. 
We have   parted with our Lizzie to go to Select school. She boards   with John and Sallie Hilles who very kindly offered to take   her- & so far likes her school very much better
than any she ever attended before. I loved that school very   much & whenever I think of it, always see, in my minds eye,-   thee & Julia & Clemmy coming in - &  going to the cloak   room.-
We miss Lizzie exceedingly & I am ready to wonder   how we shall do without her for six months.- She is to come   home after every monthly examination & I long for the time   to arrive.-
Has Clemmy been much with thee lately? I have   scarcely heard of her since her return from Baltimore or of   Julia for a long time- I saw some of George’s pictures   favorably noted in an “art criticism” the other day, at   least I supposed they were his. George B. Wood is his name,   isnt it?
How sad it is that Mary Ann Morris
continued so poorly- tho indeed it is not to be wondered at.   Mary wrote me a few days ago- that she was still much   afflicted with sleeplessness - &  was very nervous. The   former must be most distressing & very [wearing] upon the   constitution.- I hope cousin Eliza will be better for living   in Germantown as the trips out there have done her so much   good. It is to be hoped their walls will not tumble down   before they get moved tho [-----] does not think it would be   son fine &  exciting. – I think their house will be a good   way from you will it not? I am hoping dear Annie to spend a   few days with thee before a very great while- tho I cannot   now see when it will be – probably not for some weeks.- Tho   I do want exceedingly to see thee & as I said before fully   expected to before this. Please write to me when thee feels   like it.- Father  mother have gone out to teaor would said their love- Mine please to thy sister Lizzie &   a large share for thy self from they truly attached

Title: 1857 June 17, New York, to Anne

New York 6 mo 17th 1857 —

My dear Anne,

Laura   just brought me up thy letter to read I had been lying down   since dinner and after our journey down to meeting felt like   resting –  I felt almost afraid to go down in the   neighbourhood of the City Hall where we went to Stewart’s to   get some tarleton muslin to see if we could not fold it so   as to cover the cracks of William’s big looking glass – it   will look better and I expect Laura will have it hung in the   spare room, where thee can look at thyself from head to foot   when thee comes on –  felt glad that Rebecca happened to be   out ready to take thy place in waiting on thy mother –   forgot to say why I was afraid to go in the neighbourhood of   the City Hall suppose the papers have informed you of the   riot between the police appointed by the Mayor and those   under the Govenor there was a great time yesterday but I   believeit is all quiet at present.  I suppose they have a queer   sort of a mayor here and I felt a hope that after this   outbreak that a new order of things may be instituted and   that we shall have the Streets cleaned –  I want thee to   tell Anna that I feel so much obliged to her for telling me   of the remedy for dyspepsia  I have been so much better   since I commenced taking it –  I hope that I shall be able   soon to partake with others of what is put on the table.  I   am so fond of clams, and as they are so nice here at New   York and we have them frequently, I feel it quite a   deprivation –  Am able to eat strawberries.  We had them in   abundance at Father’s where we went 7th day evening sisters   Amelia & Hannah were there and several cousins went with us   besides Barclay and the country was so beautiful and so   sweet from the clover fields that it did seem to me quite a   treat – we left second day morning in the cars for New York   –  Came in the accommodation trainby the way of Amboy – it was new to me and I enjoyed it much   more than the other route by Trenton –  Last evening Solon   Robinson one who writes for the "Tribune"* [*Is one of the   editors I am told] spent the evening with us he is a near   neighbour – he wrote the "hot Corn" stories for the Tribune   and lately "a day in the country" which appeared in that   paper – a singular looking man his age is 54 – wears a beard   probably 6 inches long and perfectly white, his hair also   long and white – he told us he had travelled with one pair   of horses from New Orleans to Chicago and from thence to New   York $5000 miles and the horses just ready to run away the   day after he got home – he described his attack of Cholera   on the Missisippi and of the enormous dose of opium, Quinine   &c which they gave him of the former quite an ounce he   thought –  I told him of [Gimre’s] himaepathic potion!–  He   also mentioned an illness of the smallpox and said he had it   as badly as it was possible – upon my remarking that he was   not pitted with it he told me howhe prevented it by covering the pustules immediately upon   breaking with collodion –  Some of the pustules were as   large as a hickory nut, others smaller – but not a place on   his whole person where he could have put a quarter of a   dollar down with out touching some – we were entertained   with his conversation but did not admire him any of us –   quite eccentric –  I did not know he wrote the "hot corn   stories" untill he left – he was down on the beggars said it   was sinful to give indiscriminately seemed to think it was   no use to give to them that they could not be made to help   themselves – that they might as well die one time as another   which quite shocked us to hear him say – he has distributed   about $12000 and I suppose has become totally discouraged in   the prospect of doing any good –  He thinks almost all are   petty thieves –  Laura has had 4 articles taken that she had   put out with ashes in – knows not what to do – they will   take even a barrel and break up for firewood –  Thos Leggett   had their door mat stolen as well as Woodwards’ and the next   door the other side –  We have concluded to keep ours in the   hall as it has escaped hithertoEvery few minutes there is a knock at the basement door –    Robinson says "let them knock and take no notice –" does it   not seem queer that a man that could write so feelingly   about the poor should say so? – but indeed we know not what   to do scarcely and to feel that we do right –  I never saw   such a place –  One evening Thos Leggett was in here about   dark we were all in the basement and a poor little thin   creature like Katy came to ask for something –  Tom thought   he would go with her and see her home which he did and after   he returned he could not speak for tears – the scene of   utter destitution affected him so much –  The father could   not work had the ague and he thought that they looked as if   they had all become thin through want of food – she had been   coming here almost daily for food since –  This morning we   saw a group of little ones the largest girl carrying a box   which looked to be an ash box and Laura thought looking back   apprehen-sively.  We thought they had stolen it.  Robinson may feel   more than he pretends to about them –  We heard he wrote for   a long time "City Items" for the Tribune and they almost all   contained some interesting incidents respecting the poor –   he informed us he possessed remarkably  descriptive powers   that nothing he saw escaped his notice &c.  We concluded he   must be a genius and consequently eccentric – he told us he   had an adopted daughter that always shaves him – cuts his   hair makes  all his clothes with the assistance of a sewing   machine as well as all her own sewing and sometimes  her   shoes –  William thinks it likely she is one perhaps that he   has rescued –
We found Nealie here after we returned from   meeting we are all invited up there Seventh day (Barclay and   ourselves)– we expect to go if they get a cook–  A few days   ago an old servant of theirs dropped down dead whilst at   work in the kitchen which was a great shock to them they had   to have a coroners inquest – Laura says perhaps we will go   and take Martha tocook whilst we stay –  Laura has engaged the nicest little   girl to run errands do chamber work  &c – she does work   admirably  sews beautifully – irons &c  they think she will   suit them better than a larger girl – she is a trim little   thing with beautiful hair which she has always in nice order   – got a very good character of her – the gentleman she lived   with (a lawyer) wrote her character – that she was the best   child he had ever known in her capacity – they parted with   her in consequence of going out West –
I do not remember    whether I told you about the Cornell’s friends of Hannah   Leggett who board with them the elder (Eliza) has been a   teacher in one of the best schools in the city received a   salary of $600 – she is going to be married in about three   weeks to Albert Smiley.  she is a sweet looking girl as well   as a younger sister with whom Barclay has become  well   acquainted – JL Woodward is very much interested in them –   he likes young company – when Laura told his wife that she   thought perhaps some of hercousins would come home  with us – she said "Mr Woodward   will be delighted"  We are to take tea there this evening –   Leggetts & ourselves –
5th day.  We heard that Mayor Wood   was obliged to accept warrants from the Metropolitan police   who accompanied by Gen Sandford presented them to him—he is   under arrest – I feel anxious to hear what has transpired to   day –  Lewis & William and every New Yorker I expect are so   much interested –  Wood has behaved  so badly –  It was   thought that Sandford had acted with great circumspection   and he was the hero of the day – but if the Mayor had not   submitted, he told him that the law would be enforced at the   point of the bayonet – happily yesterday passed without   bloodshed –  The mayor with his 800 policemen were in the   City Hall = It was suggested that they might be starved into   submission by preventing egress –
Well Anne dear I hope   thy foot will not trouble thee long it was the best thing to   take care in time of a sprained ancle – such a useful little   body as thee has become  cannot be spared very well –  Laura   joins me in love to all at Awbury – will write soon to thee   herself as I have more time on my hands I have taken the pen   this time and shall be glad 
to have a reply –  I am   looking for an answer to my letter from Julia soon we do   enjoy getting letters so far away from all of you –Must now say farewell as my sheet is filled and remain as   ever thy very affectionate Aunt Martha

Newport, July, 6th, 1878

Dearest Clemmy,
I wonder      where your darling little ladyship is at this moment?  I      wish it was here amid all the greenness & breezes of      Newport, Ocean Airs, & perhaps you are or are Coming as I      know you do sometimes.  For me –  You know I was with my      dear Aunt last winter & now that she has taken this fine      house I am with her Still – & certainly it is the perfection      of living.  My Aunt has taken the whole house it is neat &      handsome & an excellent table – $1.000 per month.  when we      are at breakfast our rooms are arranged.the owners live in some mysterious addition to the house but      we never see or hear anything of the machinery
Aunt has      her maid & my cousin –(by the way Clemmy since I cant now      have you for a "Sister" how would "Cousin"– suit thee? he is      very good & wealthy & well born &c?) has his man & horses –       There are lovely trees & fields all round –  We are on "the      Avenue" next the Ocean House, & in front is the large place      of a Cousin – the lady is an only child & her father lately      died leaving 7. millions!  So the world is shared!  They      spent the evening here last night – looking as joyous as tho      they had 7 milns but not at all as tho’ a new tombstone      stood for them in a graveyard,  so the world goes!  But oh!      give me less. & a heart aching to deaths very door for the      filled grave.– however long ago = Who would take joy if it must be      coupled with heartlessness?  Thank God for real griefs      whatever He sends.  Do they not "all work together for      good",  & then there are so many bright delicious joys!       Thank God indeed for them!  The world is so full of      sunshine!  If the railroad is finished into our beautiful      town – Aunt & my Cousin will visit me, & also – "whether or      no" A Cousin of mine who is here now with us – wife of the      late "President of the New York College of [Physiciary] &      Surgeons" & sister of a very lovely lady a Mrs Highbee who      boarded awhile at Mr D. Lathrops in Montrose in 1867, while      I was in Europe.  She seems quite delighted with the      prospect – & now I want you to come also & visit me the      latter part of August & SeptemberI told Aunt she must let me go home then & dear Clemmy I do      want your dear sensible loving heart – & I think I could      make it pleasant to you – I will be very good, & let you go      to Miss Walkers & your other friends & if your parents &      sisters or brothers are up we will entertain them –  Give      them a handsome party as I gave those dear Dr & Mrs Parker      last fall.  Come!  My Cousin Mrs Edwin A Stevens, whose      husband left some 60 or 70 millions has invited me – to      visit her but I would rather have you as my guest –  So now      write me immediately & tell me you are coming to me.  Give      the kindest of all kind remembrances to your parents  Time      or distance never weaken my loving memories –  I went on to      Phil in Apr to Miss Mary Powell’s wedding & was so sorry not      to be able to get out to see you all but I hadso many friends who claimed me for the short time my friends  in N.Y. would spare me.

Springfield. Mass. Aug. 31st
4th day eve.

Dear   Papa & Mama,
We rec’d your letters this morning just as   we started & were very glad to get them, tho’ sorry to think   they came too late to engage rooms for you at the Cliff   House we were very anxious to hear from you in time, but you   were so long making up your minds, that we almost came to   the conclusion you were not going to at all, & had given it   up.  However Uncle H. thinks there will be no trouble in   getting them by writing afterwards.  We left Newport at 7   o’clock this morning & dined at Worcester very comfortably   about 2 o’clock & arrived here at 6 1/2 about.  Thishotel is delightful, they say it is one of the best in the   Union Sallie Parish says “its where all the brides come to,”   I haven’t seen any yet!  We got a splendid supper & Uncle   Harry & Chell & I took a little stroll through the town  it   seems very pretty as far as gas and star-light would show.    But me thinks we will not see much more of it, we propose   leaving quite early tomorrow morning for [Mt.] Holyoke.    Aunt Mary says “that all things considered she is certainly   remarkably well,” last 1st day she says she felt better than   she has for a year.  She is certainly improved, but don’t   raise your hopes to high or I fear you will be disappointed   – She’s better, but not well.  
They are talking,   talking! all the time, & I can’t write, Aunt [K]. has a very   nice room on the secondfloor, & Chell, Ginnie, & I have three cots put up in an   adjoining private parlor, its quite fine we’re all seated   round the centre table with a bright gas-light above us & a   velvate carpet beneath us, & the most delightful easy chairs   aren’t we splendid?  
Uncle H. says our present intention   is to come home in the 2 o’cl train 7th day (if the   time-table is right) I think we’ll not get out [--] 4, if we   change our plans we’ll telegraph.  Now Mother I must stop   for I want to fix my hat & its getting late.  Aunt M. says   she would have written but she has been retrimming Anna’s   hat & had no time.  Love to all
very   affec’ly
Lillie

P.S.  Resolved-that we take dinner   at Aunt [Annas], & come in quarter before 4P.S.  resolved that you need not expect us till we   come
P.S.  thats wrong!
P.S.  We will probably come   out in the 9 o’clock cars taking tea at the   Continental.
P.S.  Still talking can’t tell if this be   the final decision!
P.S.  Final decision! Seriously!  It   is extremely difficult to fix our plans, & we will   positively come home on 7th day either 1/4 4 or 9 o’cl   trains.
P.S.  Uncle Harry thinks we ought to give a   reason for our indecision.  Reason That we can not find   beforehand how long it will take to visit Mt. Holyoke as we   have to drive part of the way, & that makes it uncertain   whether we will reach New Haven tomorrow night or the next   day

Rockview Cottage
6 mo 4th 1864 –

My dear   Anne,

From cloud land do I now address thee it has   been raining, raining for days – but we cannot wish it   otherwise as it will raise the mountain springs which were   beginning to fail rapidly it has been rather an anxious care   with us to watch the springs for fear they would give out   before the cisterns were prepared to save the water and the   steam pumps were fixed so that the pure water might be   available for the sick in the Hospitals there are but about   500 patients now but it is hoped that the large field   Hospital at Chattanooga may soon be moved up here and   probably two thirds of the patients that would otherwise die   might recover I think there had been but four deaths since   the Hospital was established here  The air is so fine and   the water runningthrough sand stone rocks the sweetest that could be and I   sometimes think the patients would recover without medicine   –  Several patients extremely ill with pneumonia have lived   although Dr H said they must die –
When it does clear I   expect we shall have one of these magnificent cloud scenes –   Sunshine and blue sky above whilst below us a billowy sea of   clouds looking as if they were frozen as they formed –  I   imagine it must look precisely like an Artic sea –  We have   witnessed two such scenes when it had been raining heavily –   the whole valley completely hid except about half way up the   Mountain –  Anna Harlow is describing some of the cloud   scenes we have had beautifully alluded to the psalm where   they are so grandly described and which we can appreciate   from having witnessed the clouds in their grandeurabove and below us as well as like the present time we have   been for days enveloped in the thick clouds –  "The waters   stood above the mountains At Thy rebuke they fled – at the   voice of thy thunder they hasted away –  They go up by the   Mountains they go down by the valleys unto the place which   thou hast founded for them –  He watereth the hills from his   chambers" &c–  There are many beautiful scenes so much so   that I could not picture them to thee –  I know thee would   enjoy many of the views that are on every hand, not only   from their beauty but from the historic interest that even   now induces people by hundreds to come up the Mountain to   see the celebrated "Lookout" and the scenes in the valley   below us –  I never was at a more charming place I think –    The other day some ladies from Philada. Ellen Parrish sister   to Robert A Parrish and Dr Janney’s daughter spent two days   at our house (and rather inconveniently,two nights as we were obliged to give up our room and our   husbands had to sleep on the floor –  they had come on a   mission of relief to E Tennessee refugees and had become   acquainted with the Commander of the post Col Culver who   offerred them facilities to go to the Lake and Falls about   six miles distant –  Lewis & myself accompanied the party –    It was a scene of rare beauty –  The Falls are not large but   very high and fall in shimmering spray down the most   beautiful rocks –  It seemed to me as though every thing had   been brought to bear to make the place charming  The rocks   of various hues and shaded seemed cut into the most   picturesque forms whilst the clear mountain stream came over   its clean and clear rocky bed & went down the precipice to   the height of 125 feet –  Another face below us which we   could discover by the Mist we did not get to visit –The slopes were covered with Rhodedendron of very large   flower and Laurels and the [Fringe] tree growing wild –  We   came away reluctantly and all of us thought I have no doubt   that we either would visit it again or would more than ever   desire to do so –  The next day being First day our   neighbours Dr Ridgleys who had been up but a few days   started to go there on horseback there were six of them one   of the party told me that she went feeling rather afraid   that it was not right – they had got quite a distance beyond   the pickets and they must have been very near the Falls I   judge when as they were a little off the roadside resting   off their horses they saw a man dressed in Rebel uniform,   grey cloth and brass buttons passed right by them [leading]   his horse and did not take notice of them – one of the   gentlemen called after him after he passed – "My kind sir   where do you belong?" he repliedat General Thomas’ Headquarters.  They all believed him to   be a rebel officer and as he had a large revolver and they   were unarmed he could have captured the whole of them – they   were pretty much frightened and concluded to turn their   horses heads homeward and did not see the Falls – so much   for their pleasure party on First day –  In speaking of it   it was remarked that sometimes our scouts go dressed in   Rebel uniform – it might have been one of them –  There is   another very beautiful place called "Rock City"–  The brow   of this Mountain is crowned with soft kind of Rocks which   look as if some day had been washed and rounded by water   covering them –  Geologists would say they had –  At Rock   City these rocks cover the ground, at one place like a town   and at another we walked over them and gathered the most   beautifullichens and mosses x_, red green & drab, [x  with most   remarkable fissures & clefts all through them] I only wish   we could send you some specimens –  I think we might by   "Adams Express" sometime before we go away when the   facilities [of] transportation are more available than they   are here at present there have been some moms gathered and   sent to the different Fairs for the benefit of the Sanitary   Com. as well as lots of Canes–  The roots of the Laurel are   very hard and beautifully grained large quantities are dug   and articles made of them as mementoes of the place –  Our   Ben has quite a lot which the soldiers gave him when they   went to the Front – which he sells as well as canes to   increase his fortune –
Thee may be very sure that I was   much gratified upon receiving thy kind little note –  I had   not forgotten my promise to write to thee but supposing thee   often heard from us through my Children I did not know   whetherthee cared particularly about my writing added to which I   rather feel averse to tell the same thing over again –   although there is not any lack of incident here –  We have   been living very quietly here the past three months –  We   have had some acquisitions to the place lately but need not   feel alarmed at their being very extensive, without people   build for themselves or live in tents –  As I raise my eyes   I see the tents of Major Mc’Michael and one or two others in   the woods at one side of us – they look very pretty – he is   Adjat to Gen Thomas – is the son of Morton McMichael of   Philada. on the other side is the cottage of Dr Ridgley   Medical Purveyor with two ladies boarding with them and Capt   Edwards from Penn Wife & daughter who board with one of the   old residents are all the Society here except ourselves A   part of an Engineer Brigade about600 men the Officers Hospital of 100 men and convalescents   of the number of 400 are all that live here except three or   four families who have remained through all and are entirely   dependent for provision for what they can purchase through   exchange –  They sell their milk at from 50 cts to $1.00 per   gal eggs 75 cts per doz butter 75 cts per lb and have been   getting in exchange from us flour at 3 1/2 cts per lb sugar   14 cts per lb –  They charge for butter milk 75 & 80 cts per   gal and can get it readily as it is so desirable for the   sick –
I have often recurred to the time I spent at your   house last Spring when I was with you in sympathy by the   Suffering bed of thy dear Mother –  I never witnessed such   suffering and I never recur to it perhaps but with Something   of the tender feelingsthat then pervaded my heart –  I dare say thee often feels   lonely without her dear Anne – but no doubt thee thinks that   thy loss is her gain and that she would not wish to exchange   her bliss in Heaven for any earthly thing – there was a   great deal that was pleasant and sweet that she left below –   Many that have the tastes to enjoy the beautiful could not   have them gratified like the inmates of such a home as you   have but with it all I often felt sorrowful that dear sister   was deprived of the use of her eyes which to me would have   been terrible – but all things have been ordered aright we   cannot doubt –  I would be very glad to hear from thee as   often as thee feels like writing to thy absent but not the   less interested and affectionate 
Aunt Martha –
Please   give my love to Father and all the inmates of your home –

Bristol July 13. 1771 – 7th day 1 oClock
My dear   Sister

My Henry came here last evening in seeming   good spirits but indifferent Health; he eat a very light   supper, and sett off this morning (after a poor breakfast)   about 8 oClock.  He has a fine day, and I hope riding and   relaxation from business will restore him; he talked of   returning to Bristol on 5th day or perhaps not untill 7th   day next.  Thy continued Confinement and constant care give   me many an anxious minute; but I trust the time will come   when it may please kind Providence to make things easier to   thee.  I was not quite so well yesterday as usual & my dear   Henrys coming to me so unwell gave me pain.  I am quite   bravely to day after coming out of the water but full of   thought about my dear little crowing Henry.  Doct. D.*   [*Denormandie] came here last evening, and, after the usual   salutation, said to me, he was come to have some serious   talk with me; I smiled; nay said he I am in earnest; about   what Doctor? – weaning your little son; such a hearty   growing boy, who seems to live upon you, is enough to draw a   pain in a weakly person, where there had never been one   before; besides he keeps you waking at nights, and prevents   your using means that might restore you; if it was not on   his account you might now go with Mr. Drinker to the sea   shore, and so forth.  There are several women here who I   beleive have put it into the Doctors head that I ought not   to suckle the Child.  My Henry seconded him, and said he   would write this morning to thee, but as he was poorly, I   undertook to do it.–  Do not think my dear, from what I have   written, that I am worse; Indeed I am not through mercy, but   have had the pain in my breast oftener than I had sometime   ago, which I told the Doctor.  I beleive that if I had a   Girl with me that was worth a fig, it would be different,   for the one I have has no knack of making the Child fond of   her.  Doctr. D. says as Doctr. Evans knows my Constitution,   he would have him spoken to. –  I would have thee see the   Doctor and talk with him.  Patty would do a great deal   better than the Girl I have, and should she offer again, I   would not have thee entirely discourage her, but tell her   thee beleives the girl I have does not suit me, and if she   thinks she can behave so as to please me, thee would have   her call again.  It will be time enough (after theehas spoken to Doct. Evans) to come to any conclusion when my   Henry returns.  I had a room full of visitors yesterday   afternoon; two Chariotts full besides others; T. Ringold &   Wife from Maryland; Sally Hoffman, Sukey Pintard, her sister   Boudinott from New York; Serlis’ wife, Betsy Tilghman from   Philada. and Billy Coxe’s daughter, and Sally Tredwell the   Doctors sister.  We all went in the evening to Bath.  I go   but little a visiting, and they all think that my little   dear keeps me at home, and every ones cry is wean him, wean   him; thee would be charmed to see the dear little fellow,   how he daily improves in cunning antick tricks.  I long to   see thee and my dear Children, but dont know how to bring it   about.  My Henry was saying that he was well pleased that I   did not get his letter by Billy Hodge (as he had mentioned   thy being unwell) as thee is now better. – I would have thee   my dear take half a spoonful of the Elixir every day to   strengthen thee.  I have not had occasion to take any since   I came up as yet, but thee knows it was of great use to me   taken in small quantity.  I have been but a little while   writing thus far, but as I have not stopped since I began, I   grow tired, and my dear little one is crying for me; My dear   love is to thee & to my sweet Children, to whom I intend to   write when I can conveniently; they must not be impatient,   but good and kind to each other, & very dutiful & mindful of   their Aunty’s will, which will give great pleasure to their   very affectionate mammy
I am, my dear Sister, thine &c   –
E. Drinker

My dear, dear, kind Henry looked so   unwell as he slept this morning as made my heart ache; he   was last night more than commonly chearful, which I have   observed often to be the case when he is unwell.  how unlike   the generality of Mankind is he in his natural disposition   many ways.  he was last night at supper affectionately   acknowledging thy tender care of him, & saying how clever it   was to have two Wives.  We were likewise wishing that it was   convenient to thee to spend one month here, free from care   of us & ours. –  I hope it may please God to spare me and   restore me to health for my Henrys sake, & that I may be   enabled to make up in some measure to my dear Husband and   Sister their many, many kindnesses to me; but shouldshould it happen otherwise, may I be enabled to say, the   Lords will be done. –

5 oClock – Billy Parr has been   here; he says he saw thee, & that you are all well.  he has   gone to Trenton, where Peggy, Nancy and Caleb are to go   tomorrow; they want me to go, but I shall not.  Molly Foulke   is expected here this evening or in the morning.  Mag.   Divine next second day, so that we shall have the house   full.  Peggy gives her love to thee.  Henry’s asleep, & I am   going to Bath.  farewell my dear Sister for the   present.
E.D.
I wrote yesterday by S. Le Gay, which   letter I suppose thee has received.  I make no doubt but my   dear Henry will return bravely.  tomorrow will be a lonesome   day to me.  my love to neighbour James –

Laurel House July 19th

My  dear Mama,
Rachel has   spent herself so in writing to thee that it seemed hardly   worth while for me to try, so I thought I wld. wait till her   fever was over, & as this eve. she seemed little inclined to   desert the piazza, I concluded to undertake the task.  We   have had a most exercising day in all senses of the word,   but so wonderful is the effect of this mountain air that I   do not feel the least tired.  In the first place this   morning we set off in an open wagon for Haines’ fall a   pleasant ride of about 2 miles, but it was after we got   there the “tug of war” began –  We hada regular scramble, part of the way was so rough that Tom &   Walter concluded to remain behind & before we got through   there was no one left but Harry Ellie & Madge & I, we went   down to the very foot of the lower falls, & were well   repaid; it was a most beautiful spot, a succession of six   lovely little falls ending in cascades & rapids, it was   altogether quite charming, the prettiest place of the kind I   ever saw, & I don’t remember ever to have seen a photograph   of it –  We did not get home till after the dinner bell had   rung, so were obliged just to give a little smoothe to our   hair, & go in in our mountain dresses, but every thing is   very primitive here, & nobody pretends to dress for dinner.    As we were all preparedwe concluded instead of changing our dresses to go after   dinner down the stream about a mile to Bastion falls under   Tom’s piloting, & soon comes in the adventure – we just got   to the head of the fall, & were [nerving] ourselves for a   scramble to the foot, when some one remarked that it was   raining, & sure enough it was, we took shelter under some   trees and concluded it wld. soon be over, & we would wait,   but it got harder & harder, & at last found its way through   the branches, & came down on us in large drops, which were   decidedly wetting, we tried it for a little while, but   finding there was no sign of stopping & we were getting very   wet we concluded to push on home, –  At first it seemed to   have slaked alittle, but it soon began harder than ever, & we went   tearing along jumping over rocks & through bushes till we at   last arrived at the foot of the Kauterskill, & then there   were all those dreadful stairs to go up – however we pushed   on, & at last arrived panting at the house – we were pretty   objects to be sure all wet, & draggled, & hot – there were   several gentlemen sitting round on the piazza, & I thought   it a remarkable instance of politeness that they did not   ever smile, I’m sure I could not have resisted it.  Of   course we retired immediately to our appartments, & changed   every thing making ourselves most comportable & desidedly   more presentable.  Thee need not feel the least concern for   I don’t think we are any of us a bitthe worse, & the most remarkable part is we are not tired.    The only thing that suffered was our hats, but I guess they   will look pretty well when they dry, & we’ll have to retrim   them at Newport –  Thee must be sure & not forget my bonnet   so that if we should arrive 7th day night I may have   something to wear to meeting.  Also mother I think I forgot   to put on the list a thin white body of mine & my best   underbody that I wanted to have done up & brought in the   trunk – Virginia will know.  Tom wrote to Father yesterday   to go by 7th days steamer, & one of us will try to write by   the next.  We are having a most delightful time, & as thee   willsee by my account I am as well as possible, so thee need not   have any anxiety on my account.  I do hope you are getting   along nicely, & don’t feel very lonely, I know thee must   miss Father very much, but I hope he will be a great deal   better for his voyage & come home to us quite strong, & free   from all those miserable head-aches.  
Aunt L & Chell   send love, & the former says she is intending to write to   thee very soon.  
Give a great deal of love to all, &   Virginia especially I want to write to her, she was so very   kind in helping me to get ready to come away, I don’t know   what I should have done without her.  
Good-night dear   Mama,
thy ever loving
Lily

Downingtown Octor. 21. 1802.
My very dear   Son,

This ridiculous whim which thou hast adopted has   given me more pain than I can express,  I cannot conceive   what should induce thee, who is settled in the way thee   wished, on a good farm, which thee knows so well how to   manage and improve, without paying rent: To take it into thy   mind to leave thy all; a young family of precious children,   and parants in precarious health, to go 9000 miles on a   tempestuous sea, in the most dangerous season of the year,   art thou insane?  What can be thy inducement: compare thy   situation with hundred that are quite happy and contented;   Why art thou not so?  Why this unsettled idea? –  If thee   puts this scheme in practice, I hardly expect ever to see   thee again in this world, – even if thou should be spared to   return to those of thy friends that may be left –  Thee   wrote before we left town on this subject to thy father, But   I never saw the letter, WD. told me thee talk’d of going to   India, I expected thy father had wrote thee, and that it was   the thought of a moment that was now given over; thy letter   to thy father and brother rec’d yesterday, I might have   read, but that to William was enough for me, to think thou   art in earnest is more than I can, at times well bear –   consider well, my dear son what thou art [preparing]:   perhaps on thy return, if thou should be so favoured, thee   may find thy parants no more; and some of thy little ones   gone &c.  This is thee may say looking at the worst side of   things, but pray inform me what is the best side,  I see no   good that is likely to result from it–  Can thy scheme be a   view of money making, if so, will the little gain, thy   hardships may obtain, be equal to the loss and devastation   that may occur during thy absence–  do my dear Henry give up   this wild notion, be thankful for what thou hast, make the   best of it, and I trust, more will be added, if ‘tis   necessary for thee.–  thou hast, according to my ideas great   cause ofthankfulness –  thou mayst have trials that I know not of,   but going to the worlds-end will not cure them –  If “an   exemption from evil is a real good” how many evils art thou   exempt from? – be content and resign’d. –  If the former   desire of a trip to Great Britain had revived in thy mind   (tho I should hardly think it would in thy present   situation, and in those times of trouble) I should not   oppose it, at a suitable time of the year, if thou could   leave thy family and farm with propriety:  but this   East-India notion may be ruineous if put in practice –    There is no one that loves thee but would be grieved at such   a procedure – not a single word has past between thy father   and myself on this business, till [ye] day he recd. thy last   letter, when I mentioned my very great concern on thy acct.   he say’d it was a rediculous foolish whim –  Do my dearest   Henry give over all thoughts of leaving all that is near and   dear to thee for a phantom, and if thee does, I am of the   first oppinion thee will never have reason to repent it. –   Thee may remember when thee first concluded to be a Farmer,   I oppos’d it, wishing thee near me while I lived – but   seeing thee seem’d fixed in that way, I gave up my wishes –   and since, the frequent attacks of malignant fever in our   City, I think I may truly say, I have been thankful thee was   so well and happily, as I thought, settled on a good Farm –   where I hope thee will content thyself and remain. –  Jacob   Downing has been several days in and near the City, he wrote   to Sally that the fever was worse, a greater number of new   cases, than at any other time, Dr. Rush told him it wd. be   very improper for our family to return, as there was several   ill, not far from us. –  Joseph Downing has been very unwell   with fever and pain in his head, not yellow fever, he is   rather better – last week we had concluded to return home on   first or second day last, but hearing of the death of a   baker not far from us, and two cases in Elfriths’ Alley, and   several in [Keys’] alley, thy father gave it over for [ye]   present, ‘tho he is very desireous of being at home – To be   seperated from my Children at those times of difficulty is a   trial to me.  Our dear Nancy who has been at times unwell,   has been much in my thoughts, ‘till Iread thy letter to thy brother, which has filled my mind   with little else but thee –  Thy dear father has had many   attacks of his old complaint, and frequently disordered   bowels, has taken liquid ladanum every night for some weeks   past, he is at present better of the gravelly complaint, but   not well in his bowels.–  A Letter, or rather small packet   directed by thee to James Smith came here by some mistake   with thy other two – thy father has sent it back to the City   –  I hope ‘ere long to see thee, after mature deliberation,   fully convinced of thy mistake – which will be a very great   satisfaction to thy trully affectionate mother E.   Drinker

No one here knows any thing of thy intention   that I know of, not a word of it has been mention’d – indeed   it is a subject that we cant bear to talk on  My love is to   Hannah and the Dear Children –Paid 10

Laurel House July 21st/67

My dear Father,
Tom has   written to thee so very lately, that I fear I can hardly   find enough of interest to fill a second letter, & besides I   am almost afraid to write one to go so far, & cost so much;   but perhaps a little Cattskill news would not be unwelcome.    We have been here for several days but owing to the   unkindness of the weather have not been able to accomplish   as much as we could wish – we made one very successful   expedition to Haines’ falls on 6th day morning, we took a   carriage or rather an express-wagon & rode over there, & had   a fine scramble, we went down the stream to the lower falls,   & scrambleddown to the foot, Tom concluded not to go all the way as it   was so rough & hard, & one after another gave out until when   we arrived at the foot there was no one but Harry, Ellie,   Madge & I left, but we were very glad we persevered &   thought ourselves well repaid, you never told us last fall   how beautiful it was.  We did not get home till after they   had gone to dinner so were obliged to go in just as we were   in our mountain dresses, & as we were all prepared concluded   to go under Tom’s guidence to visit Bastion falls   afterwards.  So about 4 we set off prepared to have a very   jolly time, Tom went ahead and cleared the way, & we   followed jumping over the logs & stones which Thomas   declare[d] were not there last fall, & must be the result of   last winters slide;Just as we arrived at the head of the fall, & were   congratulating ourselves on the prospect before us, what   should it do but begin to rain!  At first we thought it   would only be a little shower, & took shelter under the   trees as there were unfortunately no overhanging rocks –   this did very well for a little while, but instead of   stopping the rain got harder & harder, & at last began to   find its way through the trees & onto us – we soon found   ourselves getting very moist, & began to confer on measures   of relief, it was at length concluded as we were already   quite wet, & there was no sign of stopping to start for   home.  At first it seemed to slacked a little & we pushed   bravely on, but it got faster & faster & by the time we   reached the foot of Cauterskillwe were thoroughly drenched & in despair at having to ascend   all those dreadful steps – I wish thee could have seen us as   we came up to the house too tired to run any more dragging   along all dripping & hot, looking as much as possible like   drowned rats.  The gentlemen on the piazza were so polite as   not even to smile, but I’m sure I could not have helped. it.   I don’t think we any of us suffered for it though, & I did   not even feel tired in the evening, this mountain air is so   invigorating.  Yesterday it rained perseveringly & we had to   amuse ourselves as best we could reading, & walking on the   piazza.  The company here is not as congeneal as we could   wish, & we often envy Aunt Annie & Cous. Clem in their   Adirondack society.  One young gentleman regaledus last night with some Scotch songs, but it was very   inferior to Carry Rowland’s performance.  I think Tom told   thee that we have the same room you had last year, & enjoy   it very much, it is so nice having that beautiful view   always before us, I think I enjoy it much more than the map   in front of the Mountain House; it is so constantly   changing, sometimes that distant mountain will be entirely   hid by the clouds, & it is so beautiful to see them coming &   going; we have had no perfectly clear weather since we   arrived, & have become almost discouraged, & the   chamber-maid told me by way of comfort yesterday, that it   sometimes rained strait aheadfor a week, however it really does look like clearing now,   the clouds are drifting away, & there are great patches of   blue-sky.  If it is clear tomorrow we have planned an   expedition to the Plauterkill which I hope will be a   success.  Tom Stokes & Harry had intended starting on a   fishing excursion yesterday but after routing out of their   beds about 4, & eating sandwitches preparatory to starting,   were obliged to give up on account of the rain, & go back to   bed in disgust.  We have only received one letter from home   which reported all well, but by the time this reaches thee   thee will have received more recent news.  All send their   love & wishes for thy welfare wh. means I suppose that they   hope thee is not awfully sick, in which I heartily join,   Thee must notimagin from my description that we are not having a good   time for we are only the rain was a little dampening but   since the sun has come out we feel very lively & up to any   amount of of scrambling.  Write by every steamer & tell us   every thing.
Thy very affectionate
Lily

Sept. 17th. 1862.

Dear Chellie, 
I have been      waiting for news, before answering your last letter and am      now not much better off, but you write such very short      letters that I am not at all conscientious about making mine      short also.  I wish my dear, that you would make your      letters a little longer, & if you do not you will see mine      gradually decreasing in length, till there is hardly any      letter at all.  Uncle James went off to Harrisburg on Monday      as did Uncle Clem George Emlen John Thayre (my cousins) and      Cousin George Biddle.  Uncle Clem never told a soul that he      was going and on Sunday night when John went to the      Baltimore depot to see Gerge Emlen and John Thayre off to      his surprise he saw Uncle Clem.He was going off without bidding us good-bye when perhaps we      may never see him again.  He always was very queer but this      beats every thing.  Is not the war news splendid?  I have      not been so glad since the battle of Drainsville,      particularly about Howell Cobb the old traitor.  There is      now not the slightest fear of our having Stonewall Jackson      in Philadelphia but I pity the poor citizens of Cincinnati.       Cousin Sam Cox was called to a churchthere (St. Paul’s) and he accepted.  He left town two weeks      from yesterday and when he arrived at Cincinnati he was not      allowed to enter the city but was sent to a boarding house      about two miles from the city.  There he is now with his      wife children and father.  Of their furniture they know      nothing and are not allowed to go to the city to see about      it.  Every morning at five o’clock all the bells in the town      ring and every man who is able to carry a gun assembles in      some perminent place and from thence they go out into the      country to wait for the enemy.  Even clergymen are forced to      fight & Cousin Sam is in almost hourly fear of being made to      serve.  I received a letter from Martha Henderson just now.They are at present in Wiesbaden and Martha says that if her      relations were with her she would never again wish to leave      there, not even for America.  That I cannot understand for      no place can or will ever be the same to me as dear      Philadelphia.  But I am forgetting my determination to make      my letter short and although I am burning to go on I deny      myself for your good as I think a little correction will be      very beneficial to you so I will sign myself y
your ever      loving and for long letters begging friend

I was glad to   recieve such information as thy note contained, & thought it   was a great compliment to be called handsome by sombody,   although I do not think father was much complimented by   having his hair called an iron gray color; unfortunatly I   did not lose my heart with her, although I think I must have   seen her & was very sorry I could not go to meting but my   knee was not equal to it.  I could have found some time to   write to you or thee butI have been very lazy since I have been here.  I delivered   thy message to Father (about Dr Thomas) but fear he has   forgotten about it, so I will remind him of it & now I must   close for I am getting lazy & will tell thee what we are   doing when there is some thing to tell about of more   consequence.  I believe Mother intends writing a   P.S.

I am sorry there should be any   mistake about Dr. Thomas  I thought I told you, you would   have to send him word when you were ready to begin  You had   better tell him of myabsence from home so that he may understand why he was not   called on before.  So much for that - the burden of my   [----] is “painting.”  It is the burden on my mind & must of   course show itself in words.  Uncle Tom sent me word that he   had expressed a sample of color which Craig has prepared for   our inspection.  I suppose we may get the package tomorrow –   but what troubles me is the delay – Craig said he would have   it all done so we could come back the 20th.  If he has got   to put on two coats after he hears from us I fear he will   not be ready for us.  We are getting tired of this plan &   anxious to know whether there will be any difficulty about   getting intoour house on the 22nd.  Seventh day week - We have to engage   Staterooms two weeks before to get good ones & I intend   tomorrow to engage them for 6th day the 21st & if you find   the house cannot be got ready by that time you will please   send us word at once so that we can disengage the rooms.    Perhaps if Craig can not get all done & dry he can have the   kitchen & back passages finished & if the last coat is on   the parlors &c we might come in before it is dry–  I feel   sorry to have filled up Toms sheet with nothing but such a   message – try to do better next time.  It has been blowing   strong from the N.W. all day & is cold as charity Alf &   Hazen went to meeting with me in the morning & your   [br]other in the afternoon but its dull work here either   at the larger or smaller body Yankee self conceit shows   nowhere more.

Newport Oct 9th  1864, 1st day morn

Dear Sister–
I   recieved thy note (for I cannot call it a letter because it   contained so much nonsense) yester-day morning; but I did   not say poo! because I had an idea it was from Rachel or at   least hoped it did not contain nonsense.  I was glad to   recieve such information as thy note contained, & thought it   was a great compliment to be called handsome by sombody,   although I do not think father was much complimented by   having his hair called an iron gray color; unfortunatly I   did not lose my heart with her, although I think I must have   seen her & was very sorry I could not go to meting but my   knee was not equal to it.  I could have found some time to   write to you or thee butI have been very lazy since I have been here.  I delivered   thy message to Father (about Dr Thomas) but fear he has   forgotten about it, so I will remind him of it & now I must   close for I am getting lazy & will tell thee what we are   doing when there is some thing to tell about of more   consequence.  I believe Mother intends writing a   P.S.
Affec thy brother

P.S.  when I   said you on the first page near the bottom I meat Rachel &   thyself.  TP Cope Jr.

I am sorry there should be any   mistake about Dr. Thomas  I thought I told you, you would   have to send him word when you were ready to begin  You had   better tell him of myabsence from home so that he may understand why he was not   called on before.  So much for that - the burden of my   [----] is “painting.”  It is the burden on my mind & must of   course show itself in words.  Uncle Tom sent me word that he   had expressed a sample of color which Craig has prepared for   our inspection.  I suppose we may get the package tomorrow –   but what troubles me is the delay – Craig said he would have   it all done so we could come back the 20th.  If he has got   to put on two coats after he hears from us I fear he will   not be ready for us.  We are getting tired of this plan &   anxious to know whether there will be any difficulty about   getting intoour house on the 22nd.

Weston 6.th mo. 17th 1806.
Dear Mother.
I cannot express my feelings, when I first read thy letter.  To lose two such near, and beloved, relations, so near the same time, and also to see the danger, our dear cousins Henry, and Arthur, have escaped.  I feel, I scarcely know how.  I feel, very unhappy.  I hope you will not refuse, to let us come home soon.  We have but 11 days to stay before our time is up.  I promise I will not be running about the streets as thou has mentioned in thy letter.  I will stay with you, read to you, and promise I will do all I can to make you happy as I know thou and Father must undergo a great deal of anxiety on account of our dear uncle and cousins.  I wonder why you did not inform us of grandmoth-er's illness or perhaps she was taken very unexpecdedly. I am ashamed to say, I know very little about the eclipse.  All that I know is that is occasioned by the passing of the moon between the sun and the earth and that part of the sun that the moon passes over appears dark to us. Please to give my love to Dear Father and uncle and cousin John Thomas. 
 From thy affectionate and loving son

Thee will reccollect my dear Brother that when I last saw thee I promised to write to thee in a short time.  Thee will conclude that my short time is a pretty long one but I have been pretty constantly employed since I returned and have not felt in a very letter-writing humour.  I wrote to Caroline about 3 weeks ago and have not yet received an answer I hope thee will prove a better correspondent than she or I shall have but little encouragement to write.  I have begun tolearn french and I like it very much as far as I have gone.  Sister Rachel told me when I was at [Home] that Hannah Bolton had returned from Weston I should be obliged if thee would give my love to her when thee sees her.  Thee desired to know what I was studying.  I am studying, Geography, Grammar, history and spelling and at present how to write a letter worth reading.  Tell sister Rachel I should be pleased to receive a letter from her though I am not willing to risk writing just again but if she will write to me I will endeavour to be more punctual in the answering of her's than I have been of thine.
When thee writes please to tell me how mother is for I believe all ourfamily have forgotten me and therefore I need not look for a letter from any of them.  Tell Alfred I will answer his letter as soon as I possibly can.  mean-while he must wait patiently.  I must now stop for the present as school is just going to close.
Thee desires to know how the swelling is behind my ear I believe it is much the same as it was when I left home.
Please to give my love to Father, Mother, Grandmother, Rachel, William, Caroline & Alfred and accept a large share for thyself & little Mary From thy affectate sister

Schooley's Mountain Aug 17. '42 

Dear Sister Rachel

We had so uneventful a journey, I have been so quiet since our arrival here, that I have scarcely material for a letter. Travellers are expected, I believe, to be particularly entertaining. Now, there is no time when I feel less so. Fatigue, change of air & diet, always for a time, affect my health unfavorably; and then, the turmoil & bustle scatter the little wits I possess. So that, from home, I am an especially stupid correspondent. Still, as you were kind enough to wish to hear from us, and as we exchanged promises about writing, I will not wait for any thing worth saying, --as I may not have it at all, thee knows; -- and my delay may occasion me the disappointment of not receiving here, the speedy return letter from Fourth St, which is to be my reward.-- 

We had quite a pleasant time so far as Trenton, for our first day's exploit. We arrived there about half past five o'clock; and George with our baggage, via. steam-boat and rail-road, very shortly after. In the evening, we made a little visit to Elizabeth Gummere, who lives near the Hotel. They have a fine, large house, in a pleasant part of town, & express themselves, the young folks, most emphatically, pleased with their change of residence. As we were in the immediate neighborhood, we went with Eliza..th, to spend a few minutes with our old friend, Judge Gordon's wife. She looks and seems just the same asI recollect her in the days of my childhood. So it appears that in this bustling life, there are some not easily jostled out of their way. We found the Judge, some years ago, busy with his attempts to sell his map of New Jersey. It still seems a most interesting theme to him; & if we come this way six years hence, I dare say he will even then be ready to speak of its merits & to state that his stock is not yet exhausted.-- Fifth day night brought us within twelve miles of the mountain, and the next day at noon, we reached the end of our journey--and over such roads! I was thinking, perpetually, of the children's song "Here we go up, up, up, & here we go down, down" &c &c. To adopt little Cary's favourite style, the rain had washed such gulleys in the roads, & the stones were so bare, & there were so many of them!-- 
The first two days after we got here, we had three or four showers per day. By way of consolation, we were told, this was a favorable specimen of their weather this season. For the previous ten days, it had rained all the time. "Recorder [Vaux?]" who is here, calls it temperance weather. I wonder if [Espy] is a tee-totaller.--We were beguiled , when we first came, into taking a room in "the cottage" Its superior dimensions, privacy &c were warmly insisted upon. And as we like plenty of room, and don't like much noise, we thought it quite a prize. The sun shone so flatteringly upon the [compact?], that we never thought of the inconvenience of being drenched in going to our meals, or having them drenched  in being brought to us. As we have now had ample opportunity of trying it both ways, and don't relisheither, we begin to murmer. Coming in search of Health, we fancy too, that a sleeping apartment on the ground floor is not exactly the place to meet with her ladyship, this damp summer. We have some of the inconvenient "[Fine-ear]" family, moreover, next us, who have been very near getting us into a scrape. A grand-daughter of John Jacob Astor has been stoping with a Mr Kane, from Albany, and, under what her friends consider, very aggravated circumstances. They came here to spend the Honey moon, & unfortunately, were placed in the room adjoining ours. Job related to me, one day, in a confidential tone of voice, the history of their flight, as just detailed to him by Governor Coles. This they contrived to over-hear, & being displeased thereat, they imagined a series of questions and answers,-- Job & I being the speakers,-- about the pedigree, personal consequence &c of many of the boarders, which they carried directly to the individuals about whom we were said to be so curious, & from there, they came immediately back to us. Happily, they fixed upon people whom we knew perfectly well, & thus the absurdity of our asking who they were whom we had known all our lives, was sufficiently apparent, & created only a little merriment. But we were somewhat annoyed until we discovered the full extent of this eaves-dropping. Thus, the storms without, & the treachery within doors, have given us a thorough distaste to this part of the premises. Besides, there is more of a crowd than we wished to get into, & if the company does not diminish, we shall want to try some quieter region. Direct, here, however, as we shall leave instructions for letters tobe sent to us. -- We have had it very warm & almost clear now for a couple of days, & have been enjoying it by driving about. The country is sufficiently beautiful to render the slow climbing of hills by no means a tedious affair. The roads are kept in quite tolerable order, & occasionally, we come to a level piece of ground where we trot away quite merrily. People tell us wonders about the flush gained and the disease lost among these hills. I hope our cases may add to a reputation, so richly earned, according to all accounts. -- I should write to Caroline, but I am not a very disinterested letter writer; sowing only where I may hope to reap, --& I fear she is scarcely yet at home.--I should like much, to know how you all are, where you now are, & where you are to be for he next few weeks.--Does thee know where Father & Mother are & when Cara returns? When do you go to Susquehanna [---] & how are Anne's eyes? Tell her I have not seen a single cat since I left home; but we have plenty of little ducks & chickens, the feeding of which is a daily source of amusement to the children. I heard them complaining this morning, that the older ladies were interfering with this, their peculiar privilege. Indeed the belles and beaux seem to find it quite as entertaining as they--remember, my dear R, that thee is bound to procure me a letter, in some way. Either from under thy own hand, (how is it?) or from one of those to whom thee can say "do this & he doeth it." If thee is not well enough, I shall calculate a little, too, on the affection & kindness of my nephews & niece. I do not know whether it will be any thing of a bribe-but I always make it a point to answer letters addressed to me--some time or other. If I should not

Haines and High Street & Locust Avenue bridges were all washed away and a man and a and a boy were going along Locust avenue after darkand the lamps were not lit because of the rain I suppose and the both of them were drowned. Uncle Harry & Aunt Mary and Anna are staying over here and we are having a splendid time. Brother Jonnie & Chellie & Hazen came home yesterday to dinner and we think they look better except Hazen but we are going to sent him down to Atlantic City tomorrow to get fat. Cousin Clemmie came over to meeting today and went to Uncle Tom's to dinner. I am going to wait till Alexis is smart enough to writeto me before I write to him.

February 9th 1810

Dear Brother. 

It seems as if it always came to my lot to write to thee, and although I have not much objection in common, especially when I have any thing to tell thee of that may give thee pleasure, yet when anything of a contrary nature happens, I think I had rather give up the pen to an able hand which while it informs of the affliction, can at the same time mingle some portion of consolation therewith, but as no other has time to write, I must, however unpleasant the task, proceed to inform thee of thee sorrowful loss we have sustained in our family, since thee last heard from us. 

Death stalks forth in darkness, his approach is silent as the grave, his hand is ev-ry where; no one can say he will see the light of tomorrow; our dear, our beloved, our affectionate Samuel is no more.  The unrelenting tyrant has taken him from us in the prime & vigour of his life; that sweet voice, which has oft  been the first sound, that has struck my ear upon awaking in the morning, 

alas! is silenced forever; that little tender bill that so oft hath received its food from my hand is stiff, cold, dead!  On fourth day evening just before I went to school I got up and look'd at him in his cage, he was sitting sorrowfully in one corner. "If he lives till tomorrow" said I, "I will take him up stairs, put him out at the window, perhaps the sun & fresh air may revive him."  I then went to school. After school I again look'd at him, he was sitting in the corner as before, very sorrowfully and look'd very poorly indeed.  I went down cellar & caught him 3 or 4 spiders he eat them, poor fellow!  it was the last morsel he eat. after havinggiven him the spiders I sat down to read.  I had not read long before I heard him struggling.  I immediately got up & look'd in the cage he was lying on the bottom apparently dead; I opened the cage & took him out,  I hold him to the fire & warmed himmy hands & breath, it revived him, he sat up on my hand & seem'd considerably better; Grandmother then took he sat on her finger for awhile & he flew off on to the floor, Grandmother then said she was afraid he would fly into the fire, & we had better put him into the cage, we accordingly put him in & got some tow for him to lie on, for poor fellow he was so weak he could scarcely stand.

I believe the exertion of taking him our & putting him back again was too much for him, he laid down on the muslin, struggled, strech'd himself out, and ----died----peace to his ashes.  The next morning I sat myself down & wrote the following little tribute to his memory, And is thy little spirit fled? And art thou number'd with the dead? Thy little heart has ceas'd to beat; And lifeless lay thy little feet; How stiff, how cold, thy tender wing; Thy warb'ling throat hath ceas'd to sing; Thy spark'ling eyeball erst so bright, Is clos'd forever from the light. And is thy little spirit fled?And art thou number'd with the dead? Sweet warbler, now my gladden'd ear, No more thy tender notes shall hear. No more thy voice at early dawn, I shall welcome in the summer morn. No more thy little nimble feet, Shall run the offered food to meet. And is thy little spirit fled? And art thou number'd with the dead? How oft enraptur'd have I heard, Thy warbling notes sweet gifted bird, And thought as all amaz'd I stood; I heard each songster of the wood, Alas!  no more my gladden'd ear, Thy tender warbling notes shall hear.Alas!  thy little spirit's fled, And thou art number'd with the dead.We have found thy books and I expect we shall send them along with this letter.  Grandmother sends her love and says "tell him nobody was present when the bird died but thee & I, we attended on it the last."

Dear Bill

Mother not being very well she desires me to write to thee, and I being in no great humour for writing just now shall cut the matter as short as possible. Glad thee examined the date of mother's last letter thee would have perceived the reason of her not acknowledgeing the receipt of thine, they both having been written on the same day. She sends thee thy gloves and pantaloons and a little something to pull sleds wherewithal. Grandmother sends her love to thee, she has not been very well these days past but is better.  All well besides. 

 Francis

Feeling something better, I would add a little to thy Brothers short communication.  He had forgot thy complaint that my letter was not dated.  I expected Henry S.D. would hand it to thee on the 26th of last year, the next day after it was written; but was not done.  I desired him to tell thee how it was, and likewise that we had found the Elements of Morality -- but he forgot both.  C. is willing to wait till thee comes for the other book.  I cannot help thinking that the perusal of thy last letter was of use to her; I fancied I could percieve thee caught a little of the spirit of it, for she has been more dutiful since in her behaviour to me.  I mention it for thy encouragement.  I suppose thou will hardly believe, what is nevertheless true -- that is, the great good even children may do by their example; especially the elder set of children inFamily's.
 I could but be thankful to Great Inspirer of all virtue in thought and deed, for the disposition thy last letter evinced.  The propriety of manner -- the modesty of thyrequests -- the gratitude it breathed -- and the discernment so indicative of good sense, that it is thy happiness alone I seek -- were all such symptoms of promise -- such signs ofripening worth, that my heart rejoiced as in the embryo buds which in the spring time of Life [shew?] forth the beginnings of those excellent fruits which, bye the Sun of Righteousness, shining in the Soul, are in due time brought to perfection. Dearest William! the desire to do right, and the fear of not doing so exactly, are precious sensibilities.  May they never be extinguished in thy Breast!
Betsy was pleased with thy becoming notice of her part in the present -- it was becoming, according to thy apprehension, whether thy idea was just or not.  In reallity tho', Ann had the largest share in the cake making & baking business -- Betsy was very busy about other things and Ann & I had it chiefly to ourselves -- I believe she was determined however, if the acknowledgement did not belong to her then, it should e'er long -- for she has set her mind upon sending the some mince pyeWilliam D.

My dearest brother, 
Would thee be willing to buy us a basket of peaches on 7th day morning and send them down by the 2.10 trian marked Francis Stokes borrowings, via Perryville- Hannah craves some very much and Dr. Sappington says she may eat a little. They are not to be had here for love or money. Thee can pay for them out of the money thee has of mine. 
Poor dear H. does not seem to improve much & her spirits have failed, soshe is quite down-hearted. She comes down-stairs in the evening but has not strength and no appetite- & is right wretched. 
I wish thee could come down on 7th day & spend 1st day with us. We would be delighted to see thee & would not keep thee in her room. The maids are improving, Sarah is a sitting up and I think Mary will be able to do so tomorrow. 
Esther returned this afternoon looking well and rosy. She will be a great help & Edith feels quite made up again. 
I don't see any prospect at all of my going toNewport and if there is any one else to take my place I hope you will invite them. When Hannah does get better I think the sea-air would do her a great deal of good and I hope build her up, and I know in your kindness you will set an open door before her. It is a great disappointment to Franky but perhaps he can go with her. It sounds very presumptous in me to write all this but you are always so kind and cordial it is apt to make us ['"fresh"]. 
It grows late & I must stop, with warmest love thy K.5th day morning - Hannah seems weak this morning. we had rather a disturbed night, for a water-spout and the closet leaked & Frank & Esther  & I were [bobbing] round in a very [-----] manner. It reminded me of a our experiences one night when the was down here- 2 1/2 inches of rain fell in less than 2  hours. 
Frank says that very nice peaches can be got at the corner of Market & [Merrick] right near the depot. I don't know how much they will be but I suppose $1.50 or $2.00

Dear Grandpa:

We went down to the Lake & caught some catfish with Uncle Tom in the boat.  We have a box of cards up here.  They are cut in pieces & we make things of them.  Uncle Tom shot at a board out by the stone wall.  I shot too.  Mamma is afraid for me to do it but Uncle Tomthinks it's very nice.  We went to Montrose yesterday afternoon with Miles, & Uncle Tom & Annie, & I bought a tin-elephant & a tin-cart for ten cents with my own money. Uncle Tom found his [--------].  Miles found it in the grocery store, & Mrs. Walker found it in the little narrow-gauge train & sent it there.

Please tell Algie I was very much obliged for the paper he sent me, tell him that I will write to him soon.  I got a very nice fishing-pole from Mama & uncle Tom, & a reel & some lines from Grandpa.  I also got a history of England from Mama which I think interesting.  Agnes & Mrs. Oliver each gave me a book, and Ellie gave me a knife.  Cousin Anna & Virginia gave me a box of blocks & a set of old maids.

I hope it won't be long before we shall have the pleasure of haveing thee with us.

Caroline is learning French and is much occupied with that, and the Reading society.  Allfred is very busily gardening: he has got a good many Flowers bloom & seems much Delighted with them.  We have had a man gardening for us; got the walk new gravelled and it looks very nice; with wishes for thy Health and Happenings, I conclude thy loveing grandmother
Rachel DrinkerI wish thee not [----] my letters.  They are not worth seeing; I allways was a poor hand at letter writing.  No wonder at the advanced age of 89 I should not write a letter fit for the [-----] of this age to see.
I forgot to tell thee that Caroline's feet are got so well that she has gone to see Susan [----].  Thee may critticise so much as thee pleases but there is not need of letting it go the Rounds of the Criticisers.
 Maria gives her love to thee.

 It would indeed be a treat to take a peep at my Elenor at the same time answering my appointment as a member of the Committee, but thou may judge whether it is likely I shall do so, when thou heardst how I am circumstanced.
Well then, besides having no Horses of our own, & no conveyance but the stage, which is too cold at this season for my frail fabric, besides all this, next 5th day is the appointed time for the marriage of Benjamin Rodman & Susan D. Morgan, on which occasion I am one of a committee deputized by M.M. to oversee the wedding; thy Father is another.

The wedding is to be held at John Drinkers who is not in very good health; neither is his wife: [--] own Aunt of Eliza's too, Anne Wells of Trenton, has a few days since ended her mortal pilgrimage; for which several reasons, & a dislike of parade & bustle, they intend inviting but very few to attend on the occasion.  Susan has no Brides-Maids & Benjamin, no Groomsmen, a good example! which I hope may be followed; as simplicity in manners, sobriety, & moderation so much becomes our profession.
Thy Cousin Harry Drinker is married in the Beach Woods to a young girl named Wragg.  A House is erected on his own land & there they are settled, probably for Life.  Richard is goingup there too in about a month, to settle on [a] tract his Father has given him. Rebecca Gordon, late love, has been in the City on a visit.

I have a pair of nice looking oranges here before me that I saved for thee & wish to send, but Alfred seems afraid they are too soft, or squishy, as he says. If however, D.

I hear often of thy being at Sewing School but I can immagine what thee does there- for there is Alfred's shirt, that has been there as long as thyself and I hear no more about it than if had sunk in the Earth - how is this? My dear daughter must strive to be industrious - She knows not what occasion she may hereafter have to exert this Virtue & to acquire the habit of industry, which is so highly important, so invaluable to its possessor - can never hurt her.

I have a pair of nice looking oranges here before me that I saved for thee & wish to send, but Alfred seems afraid they are too soft, or squishy, as he says. If however, D. Howell will take charge of them they may take their chances.
I hear often of thy being at Sewing School but I can immagine what thee does there- for there is Alfred's shirt, that has been there as long as thyself and I hear no more about it than if had sunk in the Earth - how is this? My dear daughter must strive to be industrious - She knows not what occasion she may hereafter have to exert this Virtue & to acquire the habit of industry, which is so highly important, so invaluable to its possessor - can never hurt her.  Take this as a stimulating watch-word from thy ever-loving Mother.

Yesterday when I was called to dinner I was agreeably surprised to find thine [-] Alexis's nice letters [-] two postal cards from Alf which were quite cheering, as we have not seen a sign of his handwriting since the 30th of November.  The dates of your letter were from the 6th to the 8th og Feb - and we were very glad to hear of your pleasant excursion to ["Turbia"], and the ["Bercean"], and that you had [----] with such agreeable company [-----] Arthur Albright? from Birmingham!  Thee does not mention Lilly Bright & her sisters, so we suppose, they never have left [M------], tho thee has not said so.  I expect thy father has already apprised you of the sad news of Aunt Rebecca Cope's death.  when I wrote to you last I had no idea that she was dangerously sick but the sudden attack of Pneumonia & paralysis was very unexpected to all of them, and they were not alarmed about her until 5th day noon tho she hadthen been suffering from Pneumonia and the Dr. had told her that one lung was seriously enveloped and she told him that she felt resigned either to live or die.  On 5th day night she was attacked by paralysis on the right side and when the Dr. saw her that morning (6th day) he thought there was no hope of her recovery and she died at 5 o'clock that afternoon.  She was perfectly conscious to the very end, and tho' her speech was difficult they were able to understand what she said by close attention and she called James by name a few minutes before her death.  James & Louise, Cousin Lillie Garrett & her niece Fanny Garrett, who was much attached to her  were all in the room with her, and she was perfectly calm, not appearing to suffer except from short breathing, tho' they could not tell certainly as thee was so much serenity. 
Mother had not time to finish this letter but I thought as possibly Alfs letter might be forwarded to some other place than yours I had better let this go so that you might be [----] to hear of Aunt R's death.  It is a lovely bright day for the funeral - very different from the day uncleA. was buried.  You will see a great many changes when you return home.  So different from what it was when I was abroad.  Then all our immediate family & friends I found when I came back very much as I left them - but it has been very much otherwise now.  If we were all so well prepared as Uncle A & Aunt R. how little real difference it would make.  Only a little longer separation - But as it is it is a fearful consideration to some of us.  I have no time to write more.

Title: 1819 October 9, Philadelphia, to Ellen

I have just recieved my dear Ellens Letter of 5th addess'd to me; and am much more pleased with the stile in which it is written, than I was with the one that preceded it, address'd to thy Sister.  The latter done no credit either to thy heart or judgement.  Thy Father condemned it in to-to, as the sauciest little girls Letter he thought he had ever seen; & thou knowest he is not very rigid; or as some would say, not at all particular or precise; so when he is offended thou mayest conclude thy improprieties must be very striking indeed.  My Daughter should ever recollect that when she asks a favor, it should not be in the high tone of a demand: it should not be claimed as a Right, which if not immediately complied with is to be forthwith resented as an injury; but when she wishes for attentions, her wishes should be modestly insinuated, not as tho' she believed them due to her merit, on account of her great worth & services for which she expected extraordinary returns; but as tho her Affection prompted her to desire them, at the same time that she was conscious she could do & had done but little, for her friends; while their time & thought, & industry was often exerted in providing for her Wants, & promoting her Welfare.  This would lead her to be content with such portions as they could conveniently bestow, & grateful when she recieved them: she would dwell upon every instance of their kindness & cherish the remembrance of it, as an evidence of love for which she had never, as yet, had the power to render an equivalent, & she would hasten to qualify herself to become useful to them, in her turn, especially to her Mother, who, if she lives, must shortly be overtaken by Age & its attendant infirmities.  Then the kind offices, the endearments & domestic services of a dutiful affectionate Daughter, are an invaluable treasure.  These considerations, when once embraced, cannot fail to sink deep in the heart of sensibility" & will, if cherished, bring forth those substantial [-------] of Virtue in my beloved daughter, which my heartincessantly longs for.  After all my dear Ellen, I still flatter myself, that in regard to the said saucy letter the fault lays more in the manner & language, than the heart that dictated it:  I am by no means displeased that thou should'st prize our love & cover the marks of it; & am in hopes that the fear, the dread, & horror of being hated (so earnestly express'd & often repeated) will operate to induce thee to be best calculated to win back affection, even if it has fled.  But on this subject I need not enlarge.  Thou knowest well what my desires for thee are.  Thou hast only to look back & reflect on my frequent labors of love, & painful anxieties on thy account (lest thou should not be what my heart craves,) and it will be enough: - yet there is one still remains untouch'd, on which I feel in duty bound to refresh thy memory.  I mean the observance of respect to thy Teachers & superintendants; absolute & complete perfection is seldom found among Mortals; as least it takes (in most of us) nearly a whole Life to attain it: do not therefore indulge a disposition in thyself, neither take part with any who do so, to make exceptions or look out for faults in those who have so great a weight of Care & responsibility upon them; but rather turn thy attention to thy own deficiencies & need of improvement.  If their patience & sweetness is not uniform, recollect that thy own, if in their situation, would probably come far short of what is expected , remember that it is for the sake of order, & for thy own, or the general good.  By forgetfulness or ignorance of these truths, Children often display the weakness of their understandings, their excess of selfish feeling, & total want of feeling for others.  It is never too early to begin to do good, & few little girls, who were resolved to make a firm stand against these errors: but it must begin at one, & how proud should I be, would but my Ellen resolve to be that one what a happiness would it be to know that she had been the instrument of giving a new tone of feeling & action to the whole of the little community of which she is a Member - a tone so correct & beautiful too, as to excite general approbation!on the contrary, what a pain to find her banded with a company not only so childish, but so vulgar, so void of all true taste ; so void of all gentility, refinement & delicacy - so completely low, as to speak of "throwing old shoes &c" - Indeed I am almost ashamed to write it, or think of it.  Those who desire respect or attention for themselves - who expect ever to be esteemed as gentlewomen, should have more regard to propriety & true dignity of character.

Thy copy of Verses is very pretty, & if they express thy own thoughts & feelings, very acceptable ; except the last stanza, which represents a forlorn destitute state, not at all applicable to thy situation.  As to thy request about a jingling Letter, I must inform thee that such music is not always at my finger ends - & for thyself I would much rather thou would'st improve in good prose-writing , before any attempt at poetry is made - unless indeed it should come of itself without such "hard striving".
It was singular I think that thou should'st dream of thy Grandmother Cope never having seen her - but I have no doubt the inscription on white, which thou could'st not read is indeed of thy admirable Brother.  For him was exemplified all that gentleness & delicacy of character, which I so warmly recommend to my Ellen.  In whatever School or family he was placed his behaviour, & his memory now, that he has left the World & all us, [--] less pure inhabitants to mingle in the Society of angelic Spirits; & his watery Urn has been plentifully bedew'd with those tears of sadness which mingled, as it were with the waves that overwhelmed him; now, henceforth & forever, will the remembrance of him be precious; yea, sweeter than a garden of Roses after the Summer.

I expect thy Grandmother D-r every minute from Burlington-- Thy various messages have mostly been delivered, & all desire their love in return - (Mariam in particular) - thy  Brother Henry cannot recollect about M.G.'s Letter: but if he had the charge of it I dare answer for his punctuality.  If he does not often send his love in form, he loves thee none the less.  I believe he has hope of thee, for he sometimes comforts me by saying he thinks thy faults are much like his own were at thy age; only, his were in thought, for he was affraid to shew them because he knew they were not allowed: indeed he did not dare to let them be seen, lest he should give offence: for he loved his parents tenderly, & could not bear to give them pain; & I have heard him say when a Boy, on seeing others misbehave - get into disgrace - & excite disgust, - I am glad my parents never suffered me to get into such habits.  Now there is this difference between you, supposing you both to have been under the same temptations to evil in your childhood - that all thy virtue will be voluntary, & therefore more meritorious - that is, it will originate in a love of goodness, & desire to attain it, in thy own breast, & for its own sake - whereas he was assisted in his endeavours by the Authority of his parents, & the divine blessing superadded to both; and thou hast beenleft more to thyself: at least in thy education, persuasion has been used more than compulsion.  Let me entreat thee therefore my Daughter, not to dissapoint thy Father; when belief has been so sanguine that his Daughters could be won to Virtue thro' the medium of the Understanding, by the force of Reason & good counsel; yet tho I entreat thee, I know - & I am in duty bound to tell thee so - I know, that without earnest & frequent intercession, with thy Saviour, in true humility of heart, accompanied by love of his divine perfections, & fear of offending him - in short, without his aid & blessing, thou can'st do nothing:  As he said himself - "Without me of yourselves, ye can do nothing": - So, tho' it is possible to conform to outward rules of good behaviour, at times, & for a time, (which is better than being always bad) yet to become establish'd to be immovable in virtuous intention, to be steadfast in resisting every temptation to evil, is impossible without him:  for this cause is he stiled a Saviour, a Redeemer from the bondage of Sin; and we are assured by a revelation from God "that there is no name given under Heaven or amongst men, whereby they can be saved, but by the name of Jesus" - How great then is his goodness & how much do we owe him who tho' he needs nothing from us, has given his Life for us in the body of flesh be assumed; & ever stands, as it were knocking at our hearts by his gentle checks & intimations wooing us to good - meeting & strengthening our feeble desires after it - & all for the sake of our eternal happiness!

Well my dears, thou wilt perhaps think, if I have not written thee many Letters, I am making up for it in the length of this: and not to tire thee quite out I will now conclude
Thy truly loving mother
Mary Cope
P.S. Mother is not come; but we hear is coming the last of next Week.  Thy Capes are done, I was pleased with thy proposition to make them thyself, as a mark of industry; but would rather thee would make the shirt to learn to darn neatly.  We have had so much company (not many at a time, but almost constantly somebody) - & have had so much to do since we opened the house, that we have been pinched for time to do all.  Louisa, too, having a gathering on her hand could not work, & did not come home when we expected her.  She is not come yet.  Does thee know her?  She is Uncle Israels - Jem's sister, & our Joseph's Cousin, & my Cook.

My dear sisters, 
Have just rec' yr. letters & will write right off before what you say has time to get out of our minds It was quite refreshing & encouraging to me to get yr. letters for do you know this morning I was pretty near giving up in despair of having anything pretty or uncommon about our house.  Mother got aunt R & Anne & cous Lizzie to go with her after meeting to a furniture store & there they selected just about as ugly a set of hair cloth chairs as I wld. wish to see.  Of course they think its not a very important matter & Mother is just willing to havemost anything, that they like, wh. very much goes against the grain with me.  This thing of getting things that "will do" I never had any unity with, & as you say I had much rather take trouble now & get pretty things than to be dissatisfied with them afterwards, & I do think we might as well get what suits us, as what suits other people.  It seems foolish to be so particular & objects to what is thought best, & I'd give anything to have one of you here to consult, without having to ask the rest of the folks.  To be sure the furniture is not everything.  I wld give all the select sofas in the world for a pleasanter situation but as that cannot be had we must have it as pleasant as we can 'a [propos] of sofas, it is thought very unwise indeed to get plush ones, they are hot in summer, & very hard to keep clean &c &c.  Moreover they cost several dollars more than the hair cloth & I am not sure that they wldbe advisable, tho' much prettier no doubt.  My plan is to leave as much as possible till you come down & then we can [fix] & arrange what we want.  But they all say oh! no get everything now.  Make [yr] minds easy about the parlor carpet at least.  We have concluded to leave that & get nothing.  But then if we get plush chairs we wld. not know what color to get till we get the carpet.  Plush armchairs cost 30 & 40 dollars hair cloth 10 dollars less.  They want to get a hair cloth sofa for the entry.  I want to get some kind of a fancy lounge or [settee].  As you say its dreadful unsatisfactory to write about such things, & I think I'll just trust to getting them afterwards & come home, & then we can talk things over & get them arranged.  I am hoping all the time that something will happen so that we wont get off till fall at any rate.another thing I have forgotten to tell you wh. will greatly comfort you & that is that good Cousin' Thos' is going to buy us some nice kinds of vines to plant.  Wisteria & honeysuckles, & roses, &c &c.  Edgar thinks of small importance but I'm going to stand up for that.  I planted when I was out there two poor little bits of ivy (the best I cld get), but that takes so very long to grow.  It will seem like a different place with vines growing.  It seems so forlorn, down in this populous county to live on a public road without a tree or a vine to shelter you what cld. have possessed anybody to build a house there when there were so many other spots more secluded & inviting.  I cant imagine, but theres no use now.  I must tell thee Carry that I was talking to a young man named Philip Garrett a few days ago, who was expressing his regret that [He] (C) had declined being [brides] maid, as he said he had expected to have had the pleasure of [waiting] on thee.Yet I cant imagine why thee wants so many small quantities of double [zephyr].  I believe they do not [sell] it in less than half [an] [gr.] of an oz.  We wish endeavor to get the other things.  Mother has told you what the prospects are about coming Do'nt expect her on 7th day, for I do not think there is much probability of her getting off.

My Dear Annie

I have   been very sorry to see day after day passing away without   any acknowledgment sent of thy very interesting &  welcome   lettter, which was a real treat to me. I wish there was some   hope of thy getting as good a one in reply but what with   colds & headache the little wit I ever had seems to have   departed, for which loss I console with my corespondents   every time one of my stupid effusions goes to the Post   Office.- I think a visit from thee & Clemmy would have an   enlivening effect & when summer comes so must you.- It was   very kind to send me that excellent Photo of Uncle Daniel,   after my negligence in the
matter of which I have been duly ashamed- and I am very much   obliged for it.- We had a nice visit to him had we not? If I   had not gone then, I fear I should not have seen him at all-   except that we did meet in the cars the other day- as being   sick in Wilmington entirely spoiled my Germantown visit. so   that I could make none of the calls I hoped to.-
How thee   must have enjoyed having Clemmy so long with thee. You had   splendid times I know. Indeed no one can be at your house   without enjoying themselves- At least that is my   experience.-
Thee knows perhaps that I have been a good   deal with my friend Lizzie Howell this winter.- Her mothers   death was so very sudden- only sickda little more that half   & hour- that the shock was fearful & Lizzie

was a long time recovering from it.- She is yet very sad-   and her brother being in poor health adds to the feeling.-   She was so sick for some weeks as rarely to get down stairs.   nervous & weak- but is now stronger & brighter & very busy   she writes me.- It is often a great blessing I think to   those in sorrow to have duties pressing upon them with must   be attended to & so the mind is diverted from its greif and   made to realize that life has yet much in store for them.   –
Did thee know our Georgie has been sent adrift from his   home into the city? We do miss him sadly- but he likes his   situation in a wholesale store in Market St, very well &    perhaps it is the right thing for him.- We hope that he may   be preserved from the temptations that summoned him.- Lizzie   has come home
for yearly meeting week.- We have been looking for aunt   Rachel Howland & her family every day but hear now they are   not coming till next week.-
Has thee been after “Trailing   Arbutus” this spring? [-] and I went the other day &  found   some pale blossoms. but very sweet.- Isnt it delightful to   hunt under the dead leaves for the delicate things- it seems   to make one feel young again fot the time.- Thee asks have I   read “Snow Bound”—Only a little of it &  have not happened   even to see it in a volume. But intend to get it soon if I   can.- The part I read was pleasant, simple &  [s-----] , -   as thee says more understandable than much of the latter day   poetry.- We have been reading “Across the Continent” and I   have indulged dreams of someday seeing the “Yosemite Valley”   if my finances get into sufficiently prosperous conditions   for such a journey.- Don’t thee 
want to go to Europe with the party that starts next month?-   It must be bery pleasant to look forward to & finer still to   experience if all things are fair & no anxieties to follow   you.- Wonder if John Wood &  Lily will go.- John says he   wants to & I guess Lily would not object.- I liked John   better than I expected to- but he is certainly neither   handsome nor dignified- but [-------] & kind hearted. I   should think.- Is’nt it a comfort Mary Ann Morris is so much   better? I cannot help hoping she will be entirely herself   again before very long.- Their house is very bright &   pleasant & I should think they might be very happy there-   This to be sure happiness is not a thing of outward   circumstances [----]Did thee remember that yesterday was the anniversary of our   dear Presidents death? Wonder where another year will find   us.- What do thy brothers think of our prospects with such a   man as Johnson at the helm.- It is a comfort that the crew   of out ship of State are so staunch & true.-
Suppose   Marry Emma Stokes passed meeting last third day- I do like   Alexander Wood very much. He seems so open & honest.- Will   they have a wedding  I wonder- or just be married & go   travelling.- I hear friends at Arch Street did not accept   Sue Farnum’s resignation. Had she violated discipline before   presenting it? The usual yearly mtg storms seems to be   brewing this evening- but I hope it wont come this.- Does   thee go in and out every day?.- Please excuse this [prosy]   sheet dear Annie & write very soon.- My love please to thy   sister E. – Very loving by thine

      My dear Frank,      

      I rec'd thine & Chellie’s letters to day, when Tho's came out from town.  They also had one from Mary, and we are glad to hear of your safe arrival at Snow Shoe and very thankful I am, that you had a doctor so near at hand to extract the bone from thy throat.  I read thy letter first, and was much alarmed. before knowing what the accident thee alluded to was, but Thomas fortunately knew about it from Mary's letter & told me at once.  What a providential thing it was, that there was a Dr. so near at hand.  the children must have been very much frightened, before thee was relieved.--I hope thee will be careful of thyself, and not jump, and injure thy arch again.—
      -
      attached wife Anna S. Cope.  I hope Tom is provided with warm under-clothing.  Mary sends her love & hopes you will have a good time.I hope thee has enough warm clothing, with thee, for I sh'd not be surprised of thr warmest weather is past.  We are having it delightful here at home, the thermometer 68 this morning at 8 o'clock and under 80 at noon.  This afternoon Thomas & Elizabeth Mary & I called at father's, and afterwards at Ellis Yarnall's leaving Mary at father's.  We found them all at home, and had a very pleasant visit.  Lucy Harrison is very bright & agreeable & Anne is lovely.  She told me she had written a note to Lillie, which I would send to her when it comes to hand.  She also told me she was sorry not to go to Snow Shoe with you, but they could not go to Chicago, & as their time is so limited they of course felt anxious to see as much as possible before going home.  they expect to go to Detroit from Chicagoand then on to Niagara.  They expect to leave sometime next week, and take the journey alone.  We all disapprove of them taking such a long journey by themselves, but I suppose Ellis Yarnall will find out some one to look after them.  When they go on, they expect to spend the first night at Altoona, and then travel day & night until they reach Chicago.  I have sent Lillie & Chellie some under-clothing.  2 flannel skirts, 2 under vests, 1 cloth body, 2 pairs thick stockings, 1 pair drawers, 1 [Alpaca?] skirt.  Anna & Carrie are quite well, & the former is invitee to spend tomorrow with cousin Mary [W.?] Brown's little Mary.  I did not [?] like [?]-ing her just now, but could not well decline.  I was at father's this afternoon, and they were all pretty well.  father seems stronger from the change in weather.  I saw bro. John and his boys go off this morning, and hope they had apleasant trip to Altoona.  I am glad you met with such a polite reception at Bellefonte.  I had no idea before, that there was any such spring of water, there as mentions.  63000 gallons a minute is immense.  I think you must have enjoyed the ride up the mountain very much, if the views are so beautiful.  Give my love to Lillie & Chellie, and tell them I hope they will not be put out at my sending them some warm clothing, as I am only sorry they did not send for warm dresses too, as they have nothing warm with them.  It is now bed-time and I must put by my writing; the children are enjoying Anna Hartshorne's company very much.  I hope some of you will write tho' I do not want you to tax yourselves.  I have already been much favored.  Bro Thomas intended sending sister Anne's letter, but it was not returned from Aunt Ruth's in time.  with much love to you all, ever thy

      My dear Mary
      
      Frank has been writing to William this morning, and has most likely advised you on all points of interest.- you probably know by this time, that we are all in a good state of health, and we hope that our sister Susan is improving, tho' she still has some head-ache.  Frank & cousin Wistar are very kind and devote themselves almost exclusively to contributing to her comfort & pleasure in every way.  F is devoted to Susan and does evey thing in his power to promote the improvement of her health, his kindness is unparalleled: everything is done for us, and we have nothing to do, but join in the pleasant plans laid out for us.- Elizy H & Susan were concluding before dinner, that they accomplished very little of any thing on account of the time occupied in changing their dresses for the different labors of the day.- About ten in the morning they prepare for bathing or rather we do when Susan does not go-
      /
      not arrive on 7th day tho' we intend to do so if possible.  the Boat did not leave until 5 o'clock this morning.  I expect the irregular lately.- with much love

      Susan will accompany us to Hazard's this afternoon
      she is resting since her bath.then return about 12 o'clock.  rest, until time to away for dinner, then about 5 o'clock, a different costume must necessarily be adapted for Sailing especially when the boats, are slightly fishy & a little dirty.- then we come home about ten-time or little past, and another change must be made to appear at [---] which [---] will suffice for the evening.- but all this is done in a good hurry and I cannot say it consumes much time.- I believe I have nothing new to tell thee, and indeed, I expect it would be very puzzling to think of any such thing when Cousin Wistar is of the party, for he writes home to frequently, and describes every thing that seems with so much minuteness, that if you are favored with the perusal of his epistles, ours must seem quite commonplace; this is my conjecture, as we joke Wistar & Sue both, about writing so often.- Only to think- Sixth day evening we leave, if a storm or fog does not prevent us, and Tom has concluded to remain, and return with us last evening tho' fog was so dense that the Bay-State" did not go out, and now we have every prospect, of the same thick state of the atmosphere for this evening consequently.  it seemed hardly worth while for Tom to leave before we did.- The Massachusetts arrived here with Mr. Williams on board, about 11 o'clock thismorning having been lying off Point Judith, even since four o'clock.  Susan & Lizzie went to bathe this morning with F & Wistar leaving me at home to pass the time as I could.  Tom & Moses had gone fishing, and I was quiet enough.  Susan though it best notwithstanding your message, to try the [---] three times faithfully as the Dr directed, and I hope she will not be any worse for it, and perhaps it may strengthen her afterwards.  She says she likes it very much while in the water, but she feels pretty weak for sometime afterwards.  we think she is the best judge for what is best for her, and she does exactly what she wished in the Bathing line; Frank takes her in, giving her three waves as directed, he said the water was very warm & pleasant this morning.  I quite long to go in again but fear I shall not have an opportunity of going more than once or twice more before I leave.- It suits Elizy Hacker exactly, she feels a little tired after coming out, but it seems to brance & strenghthen her, and shee looks better I think in this little time of our [---] here.  I do hope her father will telegraph her to remain with Sue, if the letter does not arrive in time to answer it before our leave.- yester afternoon we were out Sailing in the bay, landed on one of the [dumpling?] rocks gathered some sprigs of green to press, and enjoyedthe novelty of it highly, it was really very pleasant, altho' by the time we returned, our blanket shawls were almost white with the fog.  Sailing seems to suit Susan, very well, but I think clear weather as a general thing is preferable to her.- This afternoon we think of calling at fr'd Hazard’s, we spent a pleasant evening there last Sixth day.  they are certainly a delightful family. Ann[a/e?] Hazard called here this morning with S & A Jenkins who are still staying with them – we intend riding out to see fr'd Jenkins before we go.- 4th day morn.  I was obliged to leave this shut hastily yesterday afternoon, as Thomas Hazard & his wife called upon us inviting us to spend this afternoon with them which we intend doing.  Elizy & Frank are much disappointed I believe in Fanny H’s beauty, but they must see her at [---] before they fully decide.  She is perfect at home.- my love to all- Susan and Lizzie are taking a nap before dinner, and I cannot disturb them now.- there is a thick fog over they bay now 12 at noon, and it will [---] increase- Tom could not have gone last night in consequence of the bay as the boat did not leave, and perhaps it is as well for him to wait for us.  Frank & myself do not think it proper to leave here in a fog or storm and Tom must not think it strange if we do

Cannes Feb. 8. 1880.
   
   Dear Alexis,
   
   We recd thy letter of Jan. 16th a few days since, & have been thinking over thy proposition.  It wd. be nice to be able to spend part of our summers in Susquehanna Co particularly if you make it your home, but we have not been looking forwarrd to keeping house in our return.  I do not want to live at Connymead again, (indeed I do not think any of us want to; unless we cd. find some one to live with us)  It was too lonely, particularly for me.  & if we did not keep house there in winter, we cd. not keep very well keep house in summer.  How or where we shall live when we go home, I do not know.  Indeed the uncertainties of the future, & what it will be best to do, often weighs upon my mind.  Connymead is no placefor any body to live who wants to be a Friend, or who has any preference for their ways.  Life there was a continual struggle wh. I have no desire to renew, & perhaps we shall never know again [ever/even?] that semblance of a home.  I hope if thee and Lily picked to bring your children up as Friends, you may be able to keep them in a community where Friends live.  For it is pretty hard for a young person who has been uninstructed in what are considered the accomplishments of life to have to live where these are considered all important, & are the chief recupations of those by whom you are surrounded.  It requires a good deal of strength of character to be able to live alone, I [---], & Friends must always do it more or less when they go out from among their own people.  When one has not been brought to play on the piano or sing or draw, or paint, or evento play cards- a not very valuable accomplishment certainly- & yet one in wh. English people who are both intelligent & sensible, seem to while away at least a fourth part of their waking hours; & never to tire of- When I say, one has never been instructed in any of these things, one feels as if one ought to be at least where they are not the chief employment of life.  Of course when living in a delightful pension on the Riviera- one is not supposed to be exactly fulfilling the normal conditions of existence- Existence here (the physical part of it) seems too delightful to be long continued, & I have wonder since we have been here how long 14 human beings could live together, without apparently a shadow of sorrow or anxiety to disturb the delightful days, which seem, to glide away without a cloud either inward or outward, to mar their peacefulness such skies, & such weather , & such walks as we have- only one littleshower in all the two months we have been here- It is the most perfect thing in weather certainly, that we have ever experienced.  If we had come last winter we shd  not have had the same experience of it, for it rained very much even here.  But I have digressed widely from the subject upon wh. I intended to write, [---] the old house of Woodbourne.  Whatever may be my inclincation with regard to it, (& I certainly shd. like very much the idea of being able to live somewhere near you).  I do not thonk C & A have any desire to undertake housekeeping there.  The life of a travelling artist- or even of the traveller, minus the artist- in these delightful regions & pensions where have all the comforts of home without its cares, does not intend to inspire you with a desire to renew the contest with the [biddy?]- in art less America. If only some plan cd. be devised by wh. Woodbourne cd. be converted into a pension.  I have no doubt we shd. spend a good deal of our time there, & shd. think the old house wd. need an immense amount of repairing, & as to the old chairs of the Conklin family, I feel as if I had lost my interest in them & I shd. not think they wd. be worth the sum they mentioned.  It is provoking to have to buy what is your own.  (see 4th page of A's letter)Can thee tell us who paid the drivers on our Naples [---] wh. were packed in the same box with P.C.G.'s- we asked thee to do it & I suppose thee must have- but we have never heard.If not paid
   
   Please pay to the order of Francis C. Haines (who may be too modest to speak of it) 9 francs 15 centimes, as near as you can come at it.

   My dear Lily,
   
   I expect Caroline will give me "Jesse" as the saying is, if I presume to enter on the stage with her.  Nevertheless as she has occupied the floor for some weeks past in thy favor, I think I shall dare to add a note, tho' she tells me it must be short & upon no account much upon Revenna.  Wherefore conclude she has been expending herself on that ancient & delightful city- & forbear.  Thy letter of-- containing the childrens photographs came tohand two days since, & gave much pleasure.  We think thine, with little Eleanor, is the best of thee we have ever seen, & as to the little E I shd. say she was her Mama in miniature just as little F is his Papa over again only with a few shades more of jollity in his face.  What a sweet little good natur’d  happy kissable face it is & tho' I believe we have understood that he was'nt particularly fond of the latter operation, I doubtnot he has to undergo a good deal of it, & he does'nt look as if he wd. be very refractory under any circumstances, Indeed such a nice little jolly face must be a great comfort to look at, &, I need not suggest for Mamas to be proud of.  I suppose when we get home thee & Alexis will be a grand old couple, sitting up in the middle of your flock, looking very wise & experienced, as you contemplate with "majestic pride" the youthful scions growing & flourishing about you.
   
   I don’t see that thee has a very care worn air however in thy photo-graph.  but on the contrary one might suppose that they cares & worries of domestic life were quite [---] & pleasant.  by what you say I shd. think the heat must have been of that nature wh. wd. have a tendancy to drive you to seek for a cooler clime.  For my part I dont see the use of undertaking to live in such a climate at all, as the chief object of life seems to be with most people to get away from it.  Why not try to live, as I said to the Awbury people yesterday, where such fearful agonies wd. not have contin-ually to be gone thro' with in order to try to effect an escape.
   
   I am very sorry for Madjy's disappointment as her letter to us showed that he hopes were very much set on Europe, & she seems to need some change so much.  It is a great pity they have to undergo such alternations of hope & despair, because they have got [---] on the living side of the Atlantic.  At least it seems to be the side wh. is very much below par with most persons who inhabit it judging from the frantic manner in wh.they rush for the other shore.  The papers say that pretty much Ole America is now on the way to [---].  We concluded that the pleasure to be derived from seeing the play, wh. I think wd. be but doubtful at best, wd. be very much spoiled by the crowd of cooks & other tourists who will infest the country. We therefore have chosen to spend some time insteadin Geneva in French family No 2.  Not that we were disappointed with our experiences in No 1, but that we fell very much in love with this family last fall, when we took some lessons of them.  They are more cultivated people than the others- consequently moreinteresting, & tho' less well off- they are still friench, wh. means that they are practical & know how to be comfortable on a little.  We only pay about half as much as we do at the large Hotels, with more real comfort, beside the very good advantage of hearing the best of french spoken.  The lady has two sons, one a professor in the University & one a clergyman, & two dhrs. all highly educated.  The advantages of the education here for those in moderate circumastances are so very great.  We shall stay probably a month or more until the weather gets to hot wh. does'nt seem very likely- as we are on pretty high ground just outside the city with plenty of green trees & alps in profusion in the distance.
     
   My advice to you is to come & build a cottage on one of the hill sides of Geneva, instead of Woodbourne & get a Savoyard maid as we have, who with her mistresses aid does the work for a household of 9 persons.  We have two dinners daily, of several courses & very well cooked, & how in the world they do it all I cannot conceive.  I suspect that Madam is at the bottom of a good deal, but she does it all with such apparent grace & ease, that one cannot suspect her of cooking.  There are beautiful building lots to be bought here, by the way, on the high ground along the town with the Lake on one side & Mt. Blanc on the other, & there are many beautiful gardens & suburban residences- wh. are quite unseen & [---] by the mere passing traveller.  If it was’nt for those children of yours whom we want to see!- I shd. be quite tempted to invest in one of these little spots & settle down for the rest of my days.  Will thee please ask Alexis to inquire of cousin FRC if he rec'd a letter fm. me posted June 8. containing a cheque for $200.  I also posted one on the 13 June to M.S.C. containing cheque for $100.  As there is some risk of these things being lost shd. be very much obliged if A or some body wd. advertise Provident Life & Trust Company of [---] and [---]. of these two cheques payable to the order of the above mention’d persons.  Hoping soon to have news of you in a cooler clime & under Mrs. Hotchkiss' hospitable roof.  Ever thy affec- sister C.  Ever so many kisses to dear little Agnes & to theothers as for as appreciated by them.

Geneva, July 11, 1880
   
   Dear Alexis,
   
   I want to ask thee a question.  Is it necessary in order to effect a division of our property (I mean such a division as shall give thee thy portion at Connymead) is it necessary that I return to America in the Autumn with C & A, as it has been our intention to do, (or at least theirs)?  For myself I have not entirely decided, tho' we have partly paid our passages for the 6th Nov. in the steamer "Illinois", on condition that we can change if it seems best to another vessel of the line.  It is late to sail, but there seemed to be no good steamer between the first week of October& the last, & as there will be no moonlight the last of October we thought it wd. be best to wait until the next moon.   

   There are many reasons why I shd. like to return in the Autumn, but the prospect of boarding in Phila is not very attractive, & of keeping house at Connymead still less so- indeed I shd. never be willing to undertake the latter again unless circumstances were very much changed.  C & A prefer the former.  If they were willing to keep house or even to board near Germantown, where we could have the enjoyment of the children, I shd. come home with the greatest pleasure.   

   But this I expect they will never wish to do.  So that until I can think of some way for me to live in that part of the world.  It seems as if I might almost as well stay here- for boardingin Phila wd. not be much better as far as you are concerned.   

   The thought of staying by myself seems a little dismal, but I cd. stay very well in the family where we now are & be as well cared for as I cd. expect or wish to by, by strangers.  Then there is an elderly lady (whom we have met several times (& I think have spoken of) Miss Wetherill, Jno. Price Wetherills dhr, of Phila) who has asked me to join her party, consisting of her niece & [Pebers?] of Phila.  We were with them 8 weeks in Rome & found them very pleasant.  So I could stay very well if I wanted to- Tell me how the idea strikes you, with regard to the business- as, if my presence is necessary to the accomplishment of it, that wd. decide the question.   

   We still continue in Geneva & still continue to like exceedingly our french family.  We intended in coming, to stay a month & then go to the Mts.  But the weather has been almost too cool for anygreat heights, & this, so far (I dont know how it may be in August) seems a happy medium.  We have had a few warmish days, but for the most part it has been a delightful summer climate.  Then too we have had so much gadding about, that we enjoy the quiet & the thought that we are learning something.   

   How often I wish I cd. have Agnes here for a few months.  It would do for her, what years of study at home cannot do for any body.  I never knew before how badly, or rather how little we had been taught at home, how to pronounce french.  Then too this is such a nice family where it wd. be so safe to place a child.  Their ideas about education are good- & they have so much simplicity in their ways & manners- they seem almost like those of friends.  The children have never been allowed to go to the opera or the theater- tho' they have one, within a few doors of them.  Every evening before going to bed, we have a little "culbe"- Madam Duproix reads out of a big bible- & then makes a little extemporaneous prayer- so very simple, that one cannot help but feel as if it came from the heart; After this, we separate for the night with much hand-shaking and many "[---]" & "[---]" & "[---]" &c- The great objection to the french is that they have to say so much about every little thing & are really too polite for comfort.  I think each person at the table says "par-r-r-don"- about 50 times at each meal (with a very great trill to the r- & a very great accent on the last syllable) if all this wasn't accompanied with real kindness of heart (as in this case) one wd. become "very fatigued" of it.   

   We suppose that you are now at Montrose tho' we dont know it.  It has been a perfect age since anyone has written from Awbury.  I sent cous. FRC a letter containing a cheque about5 weeks since & having rec'd no acknowledgement fear it has been confiscated, or that he is not well.  We are anxious to hear how you perform'd the journey & how Montrose goes.  Netty is writing to Lilly as I will not write now 
   
   with much love to her & the children

I am giving thee dear William- a proof of my sincere and unabated affection- in this early replying to thy most welcome letter of the 8th which only came to hand this morning- thee may be sure its arrival was awaited by me, with more than usual impatience- I could not believe another week wd. be suffered to elapse- without the accustomed message of love, and rememberence,- and every day I wd. say to myself well- I certainly will hear to day- but very many times have I been doomed to suffer disappointment- how however- I am relieved by the actual presence of the well known hand writing- and will thus evince my greatful feelings- in its early acknowledgement.-  Let me tell thee dear William- I think thee greatly undervalues thy epistolary talents, thy letters cannot be any thing but interesting to me- and if I acknowledge them to be so- why that,- must be as much as thee can desire- as for my own I have long since despaired of arriving at any thing like excellence in the art,- and the only and slight merit- if merit it may called- which they posess- is the spirit of affection which they [---], & which prompts me to the undertaking I have not the least partiality for the employment thee knows- and often with merely for the purpose of receiving in return.-  To day I was [---] gratified & delighted- for independent of the pleasure thine afforded me- there was one from my dear sister Caroline.  I will not tell thee what she says, now- but when thee comes- thee shall see it.- I do not know that I recollect to observation thee alludes to- as having been made by me- when last here- at least I am not certain what it was.- The will find in me as usual- a very ready and willing listener to all thee may have to communicate- I hope my presence will not prove talismanic and cause thee to forget what thee had to say- I did not find it necessary to apply to Father for information respecting the time of holding our monthly meeting- it has just passed, last week- and the next oneoccurs- on the ninth of April- The [---] is- the first fourth day after the first second day in the month.- I had a sweet little note from cousin Edith the other day- it contained an invitiation for us to come, or rather go out to make them a visit- I knew it wd. not be very pleasant just now and in my answer, declined the invitation for myself- and promised to deliver the one to thee when next we met- Edith styles thee, her "cousin elect" already.-  What an appalling spectacle the burning of the Wm Penn must have been- It will have an effect I think, to increase the fears of [---] travellers-.  How sorrowful I felt, upon learning of the death- of R.B. [Thornson?], during her life we had each of us, made attempts to become better acquainted- but were never very successful- and now in her death, I feel as if I had almost lost a dear friend- her family will feel her loss to be irreparable- I should like to have some particulars of her death- I trust it was a happy one- holding out consolation to her afflicted and berieved family-.  Dearest Wm. I must now say farewell! as it is fast-approaching [---] 6 o'clock- and I am encroaching not a little [---] the time usually devoted to the indifference of my friends [---]- with a thousand assurances of undiminished affection
   remain as ever thy own

   My poor dear blue Brother
   
   Sister E has just bee reading thy letter to Chelle dated Woodford 9 mo 8th and I am very sorry thee gets so down in the mouth, and could wish I had been along with thee- provided I was wanted and could have done thee good, not that I would place myself before some others Lilly, Chellie, &c, but then maybe thee would not have felt me so much on thy mind, as I think I should have been pretty easily contented even if I did have to stay pretty close by old London.  I would have at least been a "flesh & blood" companionand not one of the ancient curiosities the guide books introduce thee to.  Not to say how much I would have liked to have been along on my own account, and the many little bits of intruction I would have picked up by the way, Well!  not wishing to assume too much I thought maybe I would have been better than nobody.  But when it came to paying call on the Hartshornes and the like, thee might have left me behind, the grandees and I, I fear would not get along very well together, some of them at any rate.
   
   Well would thee like to know what we are about at home.  Brother T at present in scouring vigorously at our new plate glass windows which have justbeen inserted into our front door, sister E has settled down to reading after one of her daddy long-leg excitements, whilst the children are settling off to bed except Ellie, whom Lilly got to come down to your house to tea, Chellie being over at her Grandfathers, while Alfred, and Frank took tea with us, Here they come Lilly, Virginia and Dr Hartshorne as escort, Perhaps thee will scarcely think it worth while for me to write all this.  Sister Anna seems to be consulting various books, following thee in thy travels, she was showing me a picture of- let me see- the old wall of Portsmouth, which thee speaks of in one of thy letters, and this evening she is inquiring for "Old England."  Yesterdaybrother J and wife, with myself took an early start for Wilmington, to pay one of those stated visits to Hannah Richardson.  It was a lovely day and we had a very nice time, and thyself and thy movements were among other topics spoken of.  In the cars that morning I had quite a little talk with James Cox, who also was inquiring after thee, and though absent thou art not forgotten.  I do hope thee found Ellis Yarnall and party on the Continent- and has enjoyed thy trip, and hope it will do thee good, I really fear thee will not get near all the good of the trip we would like, when thee gets so worried, try to look beyond the present difficulty, and think perhaps it will come rightin the end, and then thee will be sorry thee had taken so much trouble, and not gathered more good by the way, And even if it dont turn out what you wish, there are so much greater troubles, that I would have thee try to brighten up.  I dont want thee to finish up with typhoid feaver, this sounds most too bad dont it?  But I hope by the time this reaches thee, thee will feel quite brightened up, with thy trip on the Continent &c.
   
   5th day the 26th.  There has been quite a gap in my letter, the time being taken up in various ways, This morning was meeting morning and a very interesting meeting I thought it, S Emlen addressing the children, and in the course ofhis discourse told an interesting incident relating to a little girl who died lately, and who I suppose was little Mary Rhoads, Charles Rhoads daughter.  I suppose sister Anna told thee of her death, she was only sick 24 hours, and taken insensible almost from the first I believe.  Mary Haines spoke of her as having been a child of the Saviour for a year past.  Samuel Morris followed S.E. in a solemn prayer for the "parents", I think we sometimes have our best meetings on 5th days.  After meeting I went to Aunt Martha's to dine, and have some conversation with her in regard to Eugenia & Samuel, who are now here on a visit.  Aunt Constantia is very anxious S should not return to Washington and we think it veryimportant he should not, but be placed at some boarding-school.  Lilly & Chellie have just come up here, & also brother J and sister M.  Chellie's tongue has been going pretty much like a bell clapper ringing for [fire].  -that last word is fire- thy daughter has been joging her old aunt's elbow, which must account for the above appearance.  General Sheridan comes to Germantown to night, Gtn is coming on.  I suppose he will make quite a stir.  And Gough is coming too [---]!  I have tried to write in the fashionable style of crossing the page but alas!  I have not succeeded.  I hope thee can read it.  Sister Mary says give my love to Frank.  What would thee think of seeing her [---] down by the banks of the BrandywineHer visit there seems to have made quite an impression on her, she goes from home so little, and sees so little of the rural, small things make quite an incident in her quiet life, but the Brandywine is pretty fair for all.  I have not told thee yet how much surprised, almost shocked I was by thy letter to me at E-town telling of thy intention of starting for Europe.  it was so utterly unexpected, and then I was so far away from you, and could not ask what thee had gone for, except I knew it was on business, and then I would have liked to have taken a more affectionate farewell of thee, it had been such a hasty one when thee left Elizabethtown.  We had a very nice time there, Clemmie improved very much I thinkthough she has some cough still at times but it was of very little account, if it had not been for her previous attack.  We visited John Brown’s grave amongst other places, and I have some maple sugar for thee from his place.  I hear sister A and Lilly are both writing, but it is impossible to find a time when there is not some one writing to thee.  So should my letter come in at the little end of the horn, may it at least prove to thee that thee is affectionately remembered by thy far distant but loving
    
   sister Ruthanna
   
   If it should come in thy way to procure an Irish [poplin?] dress for me I would be glad to have one, if they are not too very high, dont get it if over $4.00 per ydI send a pattern of the one I have had, a most excellent one, I would like a dark gray or mode shade, but without a blue or pink shadow in it, my present one has blue in it.  or I would like a pretty brown, but dont take any trouble about it- There may be a kind not-quite-so heavy & expensive as this pattern would be

   I little while ago Carry handed me thy letter to read- which was received today, and dated 1 mo 22d and 24th and asked if I would write to thee.  From the tenor of thy letter thee seems to think there has been an improvement is Uncle Wm's condition.  But though for a little while, since being in bed- he was able to take cream again, to some little amount, he is now very low indeed, and taking only a very little wine, about a teaspoonful at a time.  TheDr told them he might not live through last night.  I came over yesterday afternoon.  About 7 O'clk  the girls and Edgar were around his bed.  He was asking about one or two of them; and who it was at the foot of the bed?  when told it was Nettie, said he could’nt see- still I think there was but little light in the room- The remark was made that he had a good many kind children round him, I think he tried hard to say yes- but seemed unable, something like a slight spasm coming on, from that time for a while, it seemed as if he might be dying.  but he again revived, and was able to speak out quite loud during the night.  calling outhis wishes he does not seem able to modulate his voice.  He is very childlike and dependant upon those around him.  How frail we are truly!  Human nature seems to be utter weakness at such times.  He  has been generally & uncomplaining during his sickness, although within a day or two there has been some moaning, apparently from weakness he dont speak as if he suffers much.  He seems very appreciative of the attention of his friends.  I do not think any of them now look for his recovery.  And from present appearances, it does not seem likely the end is very far off and yet I feel as if it was hard to know how long it may be.  He is very very sick looking now.  By dear aunt Susans removal, pooruncle Wm seems of course more thrown upon his children, And it is indeed pleasant to see their kindness & attention.  dear Clemmie especially, [*] but perhaps I should not draw any comparison, but she is the oldest and has felt perhaps more responsibility, especially before her father was confined to bed, and others had stepped in to assist.  The girls seem pretty well and much composed.  Nettie is suffering with headache to day.  and Clemmie was a day or two ago.  Edgar does not look very well to me but he was up a good deal last night.  Alexis seems very well.  Of course thee knows the girls have been passing through a great deal.  but I hope the Lord has been near may an eternal inheritance be granted uncle Wm if he is taken
   
   *more striking with Clemmie than Carry & Nettie, because of her former shrinkingClemmie seemed much distressed and unnerved last evening, when her father seemed to be reviving again, and she had been in hopes it was almost over.  His groaning was distressing  to her.  but I do not know that he was suffering so much.  If it was suffering, I should suppose it was from weakness and distress.  Cousin Frank and Mary Yarnall have been very kind and attentive.  We are expecting brother Thos out to night.  I will now close this biding thee farewell.  I fear this is a very different letter from what it might have been had one of the girls written it.*  Affectionately thy friend

   We have at last my dear son been favoured to hear from thee- thy Letters of the 21st 1mo having reached us 2 days ago- that is one to Henry & one to William.  These are all which have as yet been recd-  Much as all of us have been gratified to learn thy safe arrival at Madeira our pleasure would have been greatly increased to have some assurance of thy health having been improved.  We hope for the best & are thankful to find thou art spending thy time so agreeably- far away from the troubles which surround us on all hands- Our country is indeed in a very portentious condition.  Genl Jackson seems to be determined let the consequences be what they may, to crush the Bank of the United States.  & such is the foolish nay mad devotion of his immediate partizans, that they are as determined to support him, reckless as to the future.  To day we have a message from our Governor, to the Legislature, announcing the failure of his attempts to borrow money.  & labouring to throw the blame on the Bank- besides the injustice of this charge, he appears to be but little aware of the effect this will produce on money lenders at home & abroad.  Who are [---] thy set, & will be alarmed with fears that the state may not be able to pay the interest of its vast debt- Had he posessed the manliness to recommend the recharter of the Bk public confidence would at once have been restored, & with it the facility of borrowing.  He contemplated the stopage of the public works- Who will then be able to calculate the public loss?  There can of course be little or no income, & the works themselves must be injured if not ruined.

   Dear Clemmie,
   Grandfather desired me to acknowledge the receipt of thy acceptable letter of last seventh day. I am sorry for thy sake that it has not fallen into better hand, but if thee will believe that I have the will to send thee such a letter as would give thee a great deal of pleasure, I will rely upon the interest it will have for thee as coming from among and giving thee a great deal of pleasure. I will rely upon the interest it will have for thee as coming from among and giving thee perhaps, the latest news of some of those who think so much of thee. Anne and I entirely agree with thee in considering that the pleasantest part of the days journey was when we were all traveling together. We ran off the track about half an hour after we parted and were four hours in a pretty hot place before we were on our way again. If we had foreseen that we were to pass nearly the whole day on the road might have he fellow travelers a greater distance and lightened me and others burdens. Thee must have had a very tiresome journey all the way home Henry Drinker tells us thee had to ride from Wilkes-Barre in the hot sun in an open wagon: he thinks they did much better. When thee comes down next winder, take thou Scranton unto. We are glad to hear that thee friend Uncle William so much better and the rest all well. Grandfather seems stronger and generally better than when he fist came out in the country- He sends his love to thee and all the family. Aunt Caroline, Frank and Ellie are at Cape May. I forget whetherthey went before thee left: they wrote several days ago that Ellie’s general health was improved We have heard indirectly that Mary was unwell- Julia has gone to Reading for a few weeks. Aunt Mary returned to Jersey yesterday I believe- She was kept in turn an account of Elizabeth’s mother having an attack very much like if not really cholera. She was very ill one night: they have gone to Cape May since with Henry and Ellie. The three families that live in that unnamed corner of this country that is so hard to find am pretty much as the left them they all send their love. Elizabeth says she would be very glad if thee would write to her if thee fells so inclined. Please tell Uncle William that a package for Grandfather by Henry Drinker came safe to hand the morning- Uncle Alfred has taken the letter out to him. He comes in and spends every "third-day" in town.   
   I hope we shall hear from thee often; if thee should write to me it would give me much pleasure.
   
   Affectionately thy cousin,
   Thomas P Cope Jr.

   Dear Clemmie,
   
   Not having a woman's privilege as to postscripts I begin afresh.  I have no objections however to having reason to call the by name again – it seems more natural and sociable and I see thee look up from thy work or from study or quiet wordto hear what I have to say- I finished in a hurry yesterday afternoon intending to mail this before leaving town, but time failing I have an opportunity to say that Anne secured a letter from Eddy last evening in which he says nothing about his bodily conditions, but that his discontent which she had inquired about are improving" Your visit no doubt did him good. Visits from home to a boy at school are a pleasant recollections for the rest of his life.
   
   Thee did not grieve much about they blanket shawl when thee was riding in the stage at night; it will be cooler when thee comes down next fall and we will take care to sent it up to thee in time. Grandfather will be glad to hear from thee and I hope if thee is not afraid of a repetition of what thy first letter has brought upon thee, that thee will write to [.]
   
   With many desire for thy happiness.
 Affectionately, thy Cousin,
   Thomas Cope Jr.

   Dear Clemmy,
   
   Grandfather this morning told me he wished me to write to thee for him and invite thee to come down and spend the winter with him, and he sends thee the enclosed notes to pay thy passage.  So thee sees he takes it for granted that thee will come, and when we consider how lonely as he says himself he will be it seems so desirable to all the family that he should have thee with him that we trust Uncle William and Aunt Susan will be willing to spare thee again.  I need not tell thee how glad we shall be to have thee among us, though we do not forget that it will make a break in your family circle.  Grandfather spent yesterday in town (which is the day I began this letter & was interrupted and it is the 15th now) and went out to Uncle Edward’s in the afternoon to stay about a week: from there he will go to pay a visit at Uncle Nathaniel's: he does not expect to return to Uncle Alfred's.  He has been generally much better than he was in the spring & more cheerful.Elizabeth and Anne received thy "double almond" letter as it might be called inasmuch as there were two very good kernels in a shell and as I see that they have torn them apart and Elizabeth has her half in her keeping, I have no doubt she intends to consider it a whole letter and send thee a whole answer which shall not be a postscript to some one else's.  I do not recollect any thing new or strange to tell thee and I will not undertake to entertain thee with the particulars of Harry's advances in talking & Franky's in gymnastics which are uppermost in our thoughts and might come out first if I would let them.  Julia returned from Reading a few days ago having spent a couple of weeks there after her grandfather's death, and we are all together again and jogging along as usual.  Mary & Carry Yarnall spent a few days with us lately.  Aunt Mary is at Chester and I do not suppose she will return home much before Grandfather.
   
   This is a very pleasant task Grandfather has put upon me.  I was not surprised at his sending for thee for I thought from remarks he had made several times during the summer that it was very likely he would do so, and now that the time for his return home draws near we are old and young united in thinking it very desirable, for it would not do for him to have no one living with him but Aunt Mary, it would be lonely for both & if she was unwell at any time he would have no one with him.  Send us word in time when andhow thee will come down.  thy blanket shawl we will send up if we can find a conveyance early enough, unless thee tells us that thee does not want it.  Being in town next winter will give thee an opportunity of continuing some of thy studies though the sciences of baking and nursing and general housekeeping may be neglected for a while.  Anne and Julia expect to continue French at School- whether they will go on with the other studies or part of them is undetermined but not very likely, but we hope they will find some way of making good use of their time.
   
   Our three families send their love & hope soon to have thee [am]ong us.  Julia says she will write in a few days.  Ann[e is] spending the evening with Laura.  Hoping soon [---] from thee and soon after to see thee, I am affectionately

Philadelphia 8mo 31, 1852
   
   Dear Clemmy,
    
    Thy very welcome letter came safe in to enclosure. I should have been quite disappointed if thee had not written to me and would like to think that there was not much debate in thy mind about it or at least that inclination took some part in it. Thee would give me a great deal of pleasure if thee would write often good long letters and thee may be very sure that I shall be interested in every thing thee chooses to tell me of thy doings and thinkings. I looked often for a sign that thee had not forgotten us, to appear on opening the letters we received from home while we were at Cape May and when we returned and still received no such sign, nothing but the belief from day today that we should certainly hear from thee before the next, save this from a letter about  it in which I expect I should have let fall some little misgivings which I should have reported of as soon as I got thy note. We had a pleasant and restful visit to the seashore and would  have been very glad if thee could have had thee with us. I should be almost sorry however that thy first acquaintance with the sea should be made when there is such a throng of visitors, it take away very much from your real enjoyment. I am glad that my first recollections of thesea at Cape May of other places here no such associations so that it seems to me in looking back on if it was always First Day it was so quite and pleasant. There were a number of new friends with us this summer, part of the time, all of Elizabeth's family except the little boys and several of Uncle Nathaniel's Mother has quite benefited by his visit and the swelling of his feet has almost disappeared.
     
   If thee had told me that thee took a walk every morning before breakfast I should answer that I doubted whether it would be good for thee, but I do not suppose once in a month or two will hurt thee. But to be up and about before breakfast and before sunrise I think is very useful and very pleasant. I am excellent habit, not very easy to get into. I used often when I was at Haverford at school to get up some time before sunrise and watch the coming in of day and I have not forgotten the freshness of the morning and the pleasant sight, and sounds there are at that quiet time. I As people are said to require less sleep as they grow old I hope to enjoy it all again and if I lived now, in such a pleasant country as Susquehanna Co. I don’t know what it might do for me. And it is very good to have a little time to yourself before the day begins, not very hard to get into the practice, very easy to help in it and easy to fall out of it, as I know. Do not think I am making light of thy "improving." I used for a long timeNot very long ago to be up some time before breakfast and desire very much to get back into the habit and intend to when I begin to practice my preaching's to thee on this and other matters.
    
   I will not believe that thee is not fond of rambling about the woods until I have a chance of cross-questioning thee about it. I dare say it would turn out that it was being overtired that thee does not enjoy.
   
   I believe I have not much family or other news to send thee. Aunt Caroline has been kept to her bed for some time, but is getting better. Mary I suppose thee knows was at the sea shore with us. Aunt Rebecca and son James B. are pretty much well. Grandfather continues very well for him and seems contented and comfortable at Uncle Alfred's.  Our [] families both great and small members are almost as usual. Is Mary Anne Morris a sort of cousin to thine? If she is, thee will have to make a little room in the place when thee keeps thy cousins, for Sandy Martin.
    
   Now Clemmy thee will agree with me that this is not an interesting letter. That is what I never did and never expect to write and thee must not take it as any measure of my good will toward thee. If I had followed my inclination it would have been written very soon after I got thine, and I hope thee will find time amid thy household cares, if this finds thee still at the head of affairs to answer it very soon. I send Elizabeth love on my own responsibility and if I was at Germantown should have various such messages for thee. If I have not replied to every thing in thyletter it is not because I do not find a great deal of interest on whatever thee tells me about thyself. I am much obliged to thee for taking my lectures so kindly and remember them so well.

   Dear Brother:
   
   I tho't it ye less necessary to take a formal leave of thee before my departure from ye City, as I had a prospect of revisiting you, before ye lapse of a very long period of time. I therefore was not satisfied with bidding thee farewell, thro’ ye medium of thy "better half". No material incident occurred during my journey hither. We were amused by ye remarks and minute observations of one of our fellow passengers, a young man of respectable appearance, probably 25 years of age, who, as I understood him to say, had never before been 14 miles from Philadelphia and had never seen a mountain. As we approached the Blue Ridge, his curiosity seemed on tip toe. The most novel circumstance that I have heard of having taken place during my absence from Woodbourne, in a hunt after wild boars. G. Walker shot one during ye day which was occupied in the chase. I will give thee an idea of other enjoyment that we may have in ye country, in Winter, by transcribing an extract of a letter from an accomplished young lady of the City of N. York to her friend at Woodbourne, who has permitted me to enter it, in my diary: "I have just returned from a visit to ye country, and have been indulging my taste for Winter scenery, checked vegetation and leafless tress to perfection. I had not indeed ye warmth of a good Schuylkill coal fire, to counterbalance ye want of which, I adopted ye beautiful sentiment of ye late Dr. Drake, "to make our climate in ye heart, & I feel 'tis Summer there."  what delightful privileges we have in ye country.  in ye gay Metropolis, we cannot as there, throw round our shoulders, ye old cloak, pitch on ye slouched hat, & slip on ye leather shoes-, then, race off, with ye freedom of untamed savages.  no, my dear, ye glass must be consulted with percision, ye dress arranged for observation,- ye hop, skip & jump, exchanged for ye measured step, or mincing gait, & a certain air of nonchalance, thrown over ye whole exterior."-  a few days after my return hither, E. Walker reached home.  ye joy of ye family was extreme, on again seeing him, after an absense of 7 mos.-  his seemed equally keen.  whatever may be his deficiencies, he is certainly a most affectionate father, & ye attachment between ye different members of his family, seems to be mutual.  this feeling extends even to the servants.-  a pleasing instance occurred on my arrival.  a nice little Germantown girl, was ye first to see me.  she ran eagerly to inform the family, but so excited were her feelings, that she cd. only say, Mr. Cope, Mrs. Cope, unaccompanied with any explanation of ye cause of her agitation.  they inform me that she shed tears on my leaving them for Philada.-  in my intercourse with ye head of the family, herementioned, as well as with others, I have been lead into this train of reflection: if we associate with those only that are perfect, who are to be our companions?  is it not wise to accept thankfully of kindness from ye hands of a fellow-being, whatever extended, to return like with like & good for evil, (a hard thing for poor human nature to do,) to condemn in a mild, frank & friendly manner, his faults, & try to show him by our own conduct, a good example for imitation.-  it is probably a fortunate circumstance, that, in a new country, we are almost obliged to hold more free inercourse with one another, than people in other situations.-  many prejudices are thus removed, & we are taught to know that tho' thro' selfishness of men, we may be injured, we can also be benefitted by them.  but I acknowledge it is a nice point, to avoid shipwreck, upon the rocks of misanthropy on the one hand, & the quicksands of good natured credulity, on the other.-  E.W’s mind seems much beclouded on ye subject of religious & society concerns, tho' he seems to harbour no asperity towards any party, but evinces kind & good natured feelings towards all.
   
   I found thy letter of 8 ult. safe in the P.Office here, & return thee thanks for ye names it furnishes, of the authors of communications for "the Friend".  several of them, I had not ascertained during my stay in the City.

   Dear Brother:
   
   The idea presented in thine of ye 20 inst. of finding me out in the woods, I may truly say, excited in me very pleasant feelings; tho' at ye same time, I feel as if I can scarcely dare to invite you, for reasons that I think it wd. not be proper to mention in a letter. I will give thee a remote exception of what amongst other things, I allude to, by refering to a frequent remark, that in every flock, there is a black sheep, & a Judas in every community. more than this, I ought not to say. I believe I have never hesitated to answer any query put to me by relatives & friends respecting my situation, nor have I any objections to doing so, unless I may have a very particular reason for secrecy. but Marmaduke will perhaps from having been an impartial spectator, be more likely to give thee a satisfactory description of Woodbourne than myself.- E. Walker bro't me thy letter whilst I was spending ye evening as usual, with his family. I mentioned what was said by thee about visiting me. George desired me to tell thee that they shd. be very glad to see thee: and Priscilla said, tell him to bring Rachel &Martha. they all seemed to be as glad to see Marmaduke & our other cousins, as if they had been their own relations. it seemed to me to be quite like an era in ye history of Woodbourne, when my City relations had actually paid me a visit.- I think you had better come on, and take us by surprise as they did, and thus give us no time to think about any obstructions, objections, or difficulties. with regard to any pecuniary considerations, I think I cd. fully satisfy my neighbours, tho' they will not listen to any direct proposition relative to consideration money.- in expressing what precedes, I have used ye freedom, which ought to exist in ye intercourse between brothers. to one, who does not stand in ye same relationship to me as thyself, I wd. have felt some hesitation in saying what I have said to thee.- I was much interested in reading thy description of ye proposed institution for imparting instruction in ye higher branches of learning to the children of Friends, and had no idea that so great an advance had been made towards affecting ye object in view. it is a noble undertaking, & if accomplished, will tend to increase ye reputation of the Society. the sup-position or opinion, that our profession, principles or religion acquires ye discouragement of literary knowledge & intelligence, appears to me pretty evidently to be a mistake.-  I was fearful that there wd. be an appearance of ambiguity in my observations with regard to the Union Canal stock.  In my last communication on ye subject, I expressed a willingness to invest, if I cd. obtain five per cent on the am't invested.  this I shd. receive, were I to give $240 per share, or 120 per cent.  consequently, if I am right in my estimate, ye price is still below my limits.  but of course, there would be no advantage in offering a high price, if there is none of the stock for sale.-  I am much obliged to thy attention to the subject.  supposing that the Bank of Penna has declared ye dame divd. for ye last as for ye previous half year, I inclose a Power of Att'y for its collection, & one also for the interest on the C & D Canal loan.  if the Lehigh Co. shd. have disclosed a divd. please inform me.  I see by the news-papers, that 3 1/2% has been declared by the U.S. B'k.
   
   With best love to family & friends, I remain thy affectionate brother,

   Dear Brother:
   
   The kind sympathy expressed in thy letter of 25 ult. for the loss of my buildings etc, was very grateful. I have become, as I hoped wd. be the case when I last wrote, much better reconciled to my loss than I then was. I occasionally leave a sigh as I pass by ye remains of a beautiful rosebush or shrub, on which I have often looked with sensation of pleasures, now reduced to a black & unsightly stem, or a fine fruit tree, scathed & withered by ye scorching heat. But my feelings seem to become settled under ye conviction, that regrets are vain  & useless, for what cannot be restored. The joint invitation of thyself & Rachel to G. Walker was very acceptable both to him & the family. He hesitated to accept it, on account of not being personally acquainted with thee, but, upon further consideration, desired me to express his thanks to you, & to say that he wd. accept it, though he expected that most of his leisure time, when not occupied with attention to his duties as an Anti-Masonic delegate, wd.  he divided amongst his relatives & friends. He expects to leave here in ye stage on ye morning of ye 8th, & to reach Philada. on ye evening of ye 9th [inst]. I feel glad that he has concluded to accept of your kind offer, shall consider myself indebted for any little kind offices done for him, or services rendered, & will credit you for them as if performed for myself. I think ye members of E. Walker's family, are of real benefit in promoting & advancing ye interest of this Country, or of this part of it. They seem to serve as pioneers for ye better classes of society, & consequently ye more desriable kind of population.  their extensive correspondence & acquaintance brings ye country into notice, & their hospitality to those who visit it, creates an impression in its favour. They at present have 6 of their relatives with them as guests , from Philada. & Wynne Wood, in ye neighourhood of ye City: Mary Jones, whose beautiful & wealthy daughter was lately married to Levi, son of Israel W. Morris, her son, Levi & his bride, the widow Jones, Mother of Stephenson & Cornelius Smith, and her grandson. Thiscompany was increased ye day before yesterday by ye arrival of James Bell from Stroudsburg, & 3 of this family. Having but a small house, thou wilt conclude that to accommodate such a company good management & contrivance are requisite. Their hospitality costs them a good deal of labour, if nor a great amount of money. Today, Daniel Stroud, his wife, George Spencer, Peter Robeson's wife, & another woman friend, have stopped to breakfast on their way from Friendsville.
   
   With Love, to all, I remain thy affectionate brother,

Title: 1833 March 21, White Cottage, Woodbourne, to Susan Newbold

I have experienced some little embarrassment in my recent intercourse with thee, and in that spirit of candour which I admire, however small may be the portion of it that I possess, I wish to explain, or advert to the cause of it. the amount & substance of what I wish to say, is, that I hope, if I may have shown that I like thee, or that I have a partiality for thee, then wilt not suppose that I am striving to alienate thy affections from another quarter. and injustice has been done me if it has been represented to thee, that I have in any way, made such an attempt. I do not altogether like this formal mode of making this communication, but there has not seemed to be a suitable opportunity of doing it in conversation. whatever may be our future connexions or situation in life, I am desirous that nothing should occur to mar the friendship which I believed has always subsisted between us since we have been acquainted with each other. and I think it is not surprising that I should have some feelings on this subject, when it is considered that thou art the only person in the community, whose sentiments coincide with my own. I have often admired the moderate firmness with which, almost single handed and as it were alone, thou hast adhered to principles, and as I believe correct principles; and not the less, because they have been adhered to by thee, more steadfastly than bythan by myself. I sometimes allow myself a latitude in light or perhaps rather unmeaning conversation, as well as in some other respects & things, which I would not do, if I tho’t that I was wandering so far from the conduct of my true & guiding polar star, as to endanger my return to its salutary influence and correct path. though the trials and vicissitudes that thou hath had to encounter may be small in comparison to those which are allotted to some, I know that they have been hard to bear, and I have been pleased to witness the cheerfulness with which thou hast been sustained under their pressure. I hope that in all those which in common with mother may be meted out to thee in the course of thy earthly pilgrimage, there may be still found alleviating circumstances, and a sustaining hand.- I think I shall always remember with gratitude the kind-heartedness shown toward me by thyself and thy dear deceased Sister Priscilla. Indeed my heart sometimes overflows with kindly feelings when I reflect upon it. In Priscilla, I think I may say, I always found an advocate & support in correct principles. I sometimes in the course of conversation with her, did not at first think so, but explanation & a free interchange of sentiments generally convinced me that she was correct in the groundwork & substance of true piety.- having now expressed so much as I have, allow me to say further, that if thou hath at any time, any impropriety in word or deed, to allege against me, I hope thou wilt represent it to me, with frankness, but with such proper caution as not unnecessarilynot unnecessarily to wound my feelings. I have thought it times past, that I observed a tendency to a different course. tho' I believe at the same time, that thou didst endeavour to use proper caution on certain occasions, if we do wrong, let us mention & state, our faults to each other with mildness. conscience, if not [---] is a sufficiently severe accuser. as I think I once before observed to thee, there are ills enough, which we cannot avoid, without unnecessarily creating others. It is a melancholy reflection that "man is to man, the sorest, surest foe." It is however consoling to think that there are exceptions to all general rules, and I trust there are many to this. I have not the vanity to think and thou of course wilt not understand me to suppose, that I have the power of causing a transfer of thy affections, but thee knows the attempt might be made without the power.    My Brother Henry mentions in a letter recently received from him that our Cousin A. Barker is slowly recovering her health.

   Esteemed Friend William D Cope,
   
   I have received thy letter of the 30the of August which informes me that thee has accomplished thy journey Westward and is now at thy own home in Philadelphia. Therefore I now purpose writing thee a few lines by way of answer both to the above mentioned letter and that of the 25th of July. Friend Cope I judge thee thinks I am a very lazy fellow for nether meeting thee at West-Chester nor answering thy letter before this-time. but, as for the former I think I have a very good reason for I did not receive the intelligence of thee being there till about 5 days after the appointed time which was the only reason why I was not there for I would have been well pleased to of had the opurtunity of seeing my Friend by going the small distance of ten miles.but, altho thy friend was disappointed of the operturnity he thanks thee kindly for the invitation. The account thee has given me of Lancaster town is very similar to what I expected it was, but as for Columbia I did not expect its adjacent lands were so hilly, or, had such Mountains in them as thee mentions.I understand Friend E Lewis lately buried his son Ennoch with the flux. but I did not understan that the disorder has spread in the family.    
   With a hope that these lines may find thee in as good a state of health as I am in I conclude, and subscribe myself thy affectionate friend.

   Dear Cousin Anna,
   
   I recd thy note announcing the death of thy dear sister, and it was very thoughtful and loving of them to remember me-  though I had, the day before, recd a short note from Henry himself. It was sudden as sad to me, as I had heard nothing of her further declining health or illness. When I saw cousin Mary last was at Mt. Pleasant about 2 years ago. Then, though looking delicate, she seemed as bright and reminded me strongly of the days of her beautiful girlgood. O, those dreamlike days! of your cousins, in your Arch st. home, and the several Paradises, that the 'Doctor', and cousin Frank and I need to riflealong the Schuykill and Wissahiccon every spring- for the first and fairest flowers and how you loved to prink your happy parlors with them. I replied quite at length. For me to Henry’s letter, and told him I hoped to come on to P. to see my brothers soon, and hoped to see him which I still wish to do. It would have been a great comfort to me, if I could have come on to the funeral, but my state of health at that time prevented by a sudden change in the weather I had taken. A touch of Pleurisy which I had to break up I and we all, Mariann and Anna (who meet Cousin Mary at mt. Pleasant), were with you that sad afternoon in mournful communion. Is n't itremarkable, that you all, of your sisterhood of five, shd. have been spared to Each other so long. And as these days Mary was always so joyous a nature you must all miss her sunshine. How could our hearts bear up under all the partings on our dearest me, on Earth did we not see the vision of the Angel world and among them, our "family in Heaven". Where hope assues me we shall meet beyond all partings I fear illegible note, will find there and thin in health and with love to all and to cousins Susan & Lizzie & Fanny. I will close adding only that [Marien?] & Anna wish their love to you. Excuse my not replying to thy letters, Dear Cousin Anna, which I wasvery grateful for. For if the Dr. had not written, I should have heard, very sorrowfully so I have in several cases of Philada relations, when the first news I heard was long after: Knowing of it and I could mingle with you in Spirit, and live over our happy long days and anticipate those happier ones to come. That Death cannot end, nor sorrow overcast.
   Love especially to cousin Frank.
   
   From thy Afft,
   Cousin Edward
   
   P.S. After I wrote this last note Cousin Anna, recd Alfred cards & those for Sister Anna & Henry wh. We have forwarded to Boston. It mush be a very happy affair. All sounds and we should be glad to be present but Anna will have too send cards instead. Aff, EdwardNot Being sure of your home P.S. address I mail this for Brr David to forward.

   Martha and I wish to tell thee how much we appreciate being asked to go to Awbury today-    I can remember so well the day of your & Cousin Frank's Wedding, and the evening soon after which you spent with my father and Mother. I was only seven years old but itmade a great impression upon me- and cousin Frank's kind greeting to me then was never forgotten. as I grew older and learned to know more about him my childish regard grew into respect and reverence and from that time until now, it has been a happiness to know that I could claim as a cousin one whose character I so thoroughly admired and respected- it is indeed men such as he was, who makeour country great and at the same time have all the gentle qualities which inspire admiration and affection-  We cannot regret that he has gone, for he had billed the full measure of his days, we can only remember that "Precious in the light of the Lord is the death of his Saints"
   
   With love from Martha and Me, I am dear Cousin Anna.

   Dear Alg-
   
   Words are so hopelessly futile and especially are they so when cold on the paper that I hesitate to make the attempt to express the very deep feelings that the recent news inspired in me.  Our meetings together during the past year had had the effect of developing in me desires for development and usefulness as thosewhich most manifestly animated him and especially during the past few months I had looked forward to a future where we might work for the common object of developing in ourselves and thence to our meeting and Society a deeper truer life.  And so it comes that I feel as though I might to at least make the attempt to tell you all how deep is my sense ofof personal loss and there fore how sincerely I sympathize with thee and the rest of his family in the loss of him from your circle.
   
   I know of no one person who, of recent years, has had more influence for good when upon me than did Ernest and it seemed to me that the bottom had dropped out of every thing when I learned that he wastaken but tho it does still seem that way there is the perfectly sure knowledge that the very little knowledge I have of his life will stay with me as an inspiration.  Tho it was seldom we got together I feel as tho I, too, had lost a brother.
   
   With sympathy which I really cannot express
   sincerely

   Dear Lily,
   
   There has been a lack of vocal or written sympathy with thee this winter, and this brief message is only to assure thee of my love and frequent thought being freshly flowing.That mere words would only weary thee I know and I only sent messages to thee by notes to Rachel. It was my hope that long before this my own strength would have retuned and enabled me to go to thee. But that is not the case as only a very little exertion ispossible yet - writing, almost is a lost art. Excuse this detail, because I could not otherwise explain my absence. Now we have heard of Edward's illness, and I wish to send by thee my love to Jonathan and Rachel, when it is convient to thee.
   
   We Also understand Edward is much beter, I hope convalescent.Dear, believe me, thy loss is shared in some degree by me, for thy lovely Agnes was especially near to me, her gentle pure spirit now a lasting place in my heart.
   
    She always seemed as one apart from our every-day routine, and now she is in full & glourious development of all her Savoir has prepared her to be for Him. Always lovingly thy

Germantown, 9.30.83.
   
   My Dear Carrie-
   I hope the expression of sympathy & affection may be acceptable, even though there may be no new thoughts of comfort to suggest.
   
   I was so sorry to hear from Sister Lillie today that Edgar's health had been poor. I though of him as a strong man. It will be a pleasure, no doubt, though mingled with sadness, to Nettie & thee, to minister to the comfort of your remaining brother.
   
   The memory of Alexis is one of calmness & sweetness. I did not know him well, yet recall with pleasure the queit cordiality of his greeting. Samuel Morris, who rode in the same carriagewith me at the funeral, said he had learned to love him much. I think it is grateful to look back on his life here as a happy one, & his life there as is fit & glorious consummation. And he left a dear legacy in his children. I am glad you have them. I count myself so rich in my dear nephews & nieces, my young brothers & sisters, as I sometimes call them. Does thee know I am a great-aunt? My oldest nephew, Joseph Rhoads, has a wee Edgar, away out in Plainfield Indiana, where he has gone to teach. Hetty  is out there, helping. Has been away nearly 7 weeks & we don't know when we shall get her back. She went to help furnish & arrange the new little home.
   
   Fanny & Alfred Garret were here last evening a while. We do think Fannya very lively have character, & Alfred seems to be coming out a fine manly boy, & doing well at college. 
    
   How the time does fleet away! Think of it being 50 years since we were at West-town together! And what can those fleeting years show? For me, a life made up of many little things, & with too many idle hours. I enjoy my work of various kinds though; simple household cares, an extensive correspondence, partly for pleasant sympathies, partly for teaching, & on the rest days, a restful work in the care of my first-day class. Dr. Rhoads holds a school at our house and I have as my class nearly 20 boys & girls from 9 to 14 years old who troop up to my room with me. I will not claim to do them much good. I don't believe in direct religious teaching exceptwhere there is an opening for it, but I think the hour passes not unprofitably, & they learn to find the study of the Bible pleasant.    
   I hope Ellie Alderson may continue to improve. I should be glad to hear from thee if thee can feel like writing, & to be told what your prospects are.
   With Love to Nettie & Thyself,
   ever thy affectionate friend
   
   M. H. Garrett

My dear Thomas:-
   
   As my thoughts have gone out in sympathy for thee in the great loss of thy dear father, I have recalled an acrostic which he wrote for my mother after my father's death, just twenty years ago; and which we valued very much. I think it is most touchingly beautiful, especially so, that it now seems almost prophetic of his own entranceinto the heavenly city.
   "Joined to the loved ones who, expectant long,
    On yonder shore his coming did await,
    Singing their jubilant, thanksgiving song,
    Early & late, before the pearly gate,
    Palms in their hands; And robed in spotless
 white,
   Happy to praise their Savior day and night!
   How must his soul have thrilled with rapture,
 when
    On quicken ear, burst the ecstatic song!
    With what transporting joy, behold again
    Earths lost ones gathered in that Heavnely
 throng! 
   Loving, as only ransomed spirits love,
   Love centered in Him who is Eternal love."
   
   Please give my love & sympathy to thy mother and sisters andBelieve me, with sincere sympathy.
   
   Thy Friend,
   Phebe E. H. Haines

   My dear Annette,
   
   When I reached Holmhurst last week Nanna immediately presented me with thy package, and I opened and found the irresistable little gentleman from Dai Nippon. Where did thee pick him up, I wonder! He will be a most pleasant memento of thee, though I shall hesitate to insult his diginity by inkinghis fine skirts! I have thought of thee, and of you all so much this summer, and greatly wished I could have seen thee and Carrie before we leave. I hoped Mrs. Cope would return while I was at Holmhurst, but she is I supppose still with you. If so please give her my dear love. Thee will forgive me I know for this tardy work, I spent a whole week nominally at Holmhurst, actually between the city, Germantown, and all the [---]. Thee knows onlytoo well what such packing is. Now I am enjoying a few day's rest at Woodbourne before going back to Awbury for a square start westward. Virginia here and sends her love, also says to tell thee that I will meet thee in Italy winter after next. I tell her I give the message as hers, not mine! Much as I should like such a prospect; she is much more liekly to turn up there in the next year or two, than I! Lillie and the girls & Thos. & Elizabeth Cope are entertaining Dr. Norris and a Germandoctor friend in the parlor, else they would doubtless send messages. Please give my love to Carrie and Clementine, I understand you are all together, and are glad to know you have that comfort. With dear love for thy own self, and thanks for thinking of me amid so much sorrow, I am as always,
   
   Affectionally thine

   Dearest Aunt Anna,
   
    There is nothing to say to thee but that I think of thee all the time, and long to be near thee instead of on the other side of the earth. The letters with any definite news will be very slow in coming, as these of mine must seem late and longin reaching you. But thee knows, and you all know, how my heart is with you. I have been thinking of Father’s last message to his "more than brother", and of what both he and thee have been to me all my life. From my babyhood thee has made me feel almost as much thy child as mother’s and to me it seems those tiesare not broken but made strong for eternity, where our beloved cross to the Beyond. My desire is to be worthy of such an inheritance of affliction as mine. My love can never repay it, but that thee has always.
   
   Ask some to write me a line when they can. My Love to them all.
   
   Thy always loving niece,
   Anna C. Hartshorne

Six years ago, when ever joyous Spring 
   scattered rich gifts upon this earth of our's 
   Far sweeter than the sweetest of her flowers, 
   One flower did God to our own garden bring. 
   
   He planted it a noble plant, and gave 
   The charge of it into our loving care, 
   To train it tenderly, so it might bear 
   Fruit to His praise who for such fruit I did crave. 
   
   Ah! how kept we our trust? Was ours the love, 
   Which while it prized the gift loved more the given, 
    And sought with tears, how is might best deliver 
   The entrusted talent back to him above? 
   
   Oh! earthly love, oh! selfish human heart, 
   Weak and mistrustful of God's providence 
   Troubled for many things of time and sense, 
   Yet careless of the one thing needful, the good path! 
   
   Therefore when God our ill kept graden saw, 
   And marked how weeds were climbing o’er the flowers
    So that the refreshing Heavenly showers 
   Might hardly reach them; gently did he draw 
   
   One flower from our keeping, it may be
    Not only to preserve that one from harm, 
But that our careless souls be might alarm, 
   And waken from their false security. 
   Ah me! How little had we dreamed of this
!    Listless, beside our cherished flowers we lay. 
   And as we breathed their fragrance day by day. 
   Looked for no pride awakening from own bliss. 
   
   In distant meadows could we often hear
    The stern old mower what his fatal sythe; 
   But yet our hearts beat ever free & blythe, 
   Since to our garden still he drew not near. 
   
   Angel of Death! Ah! who may ever tell 
   The bitter anguish of our souls, but now 
   No doubt can e'er disturb our faith that thou 
   Wast sent by Him who doeth all things well. 
   
   He called our flower Willie; twas a name 
   Borne by one dearly loved, whose gentle heart
    Waited e'en then the summons to depart; 
   And joyfully received it when it came. 
   
   And we had hoped, that in our brother's stead
    Our darling might be found by name & all 
   His guiltless actions, ever to recall 
   The cherised memories of the loved & dead. 
   
   Such was wour hope; yet may we not repine; 
    Twas matchless wisdom and unbounded love 
   Drew both our precious ones to him above; 
   To make them in His Heavenly courts to shine. 
  Now other names we trust to them are given, 
   In that blest land where our loved flower is growing. 
    The stream of life beside him ever ever flowing, 
   Which maketh glad the heritage of Heaven. 
   
   And now on this his Natal Day, 
   We humbly bend the knee, and pray 
   To Thee, who wast his God always, 
    God of all Consolation, 
   
   That thou our hearts may so incline, 
   So bend our stubborn wills to thine, 
   That we no longer may repine
   In our deep tribulation
   
   We thank Thee God, that Thou hast taken 
   Our Willie from this world of pain, 
   Before upon his robes the stain 
   Of deadly sin did cling. 
   
   And in his sweet simplicity, 
   That thou, most precious thoughts of Thee
    And of Thy Heaven, continually, 
   Before his mind did bring. 
   
   overSo, when thy summons to him came, 
   While suffering racked his tender frame, 
   The call was welcome, as the claim 
   Of friend long dearly known. 
   
   An doubting naught, his willing feet 
   Hastened the messenger to meet, 
   As one he trustingly could greet, 
   Who came to take him home. 
   
   Oh Lord! Thou gainest the victory! 
   Not unto him, but unto Thee 
   Let all the praise and honor be 
   Oh, Lord! our God most glorius! 
   
   Oh! In the darkness of our night 
   When we too wage the fearful fight, 
   May we be made through thy blessed light, 
    Like him o'er death victorious.

   My Dear Cousin,
   
   I enclose herewith copy of minutes adopted at the last meeting of the Board of Managers of Haverford College and which I was directed to send to thee.
   
   I cannot tell thee how I missed cousin Jonathan at this meeting. He wasone of those I always counted on for sympathy and enouragement.
   
   Sincerely thine,
   CJ RhoadsI hereby certify that the following is a true and correct copy from the minutes of action taken at a meeting of the Board of Managers of THE CORPORATION OF HAVERFORD COLLEGE held 5th Month 19th, 1911.
   
   The President reminded the Board that since our last meeting two of our fellow Managers had had been taken from us by death, and it was unanimously resolved that the following minutes be entered on our records.
   
    On 3rd Month 26th, 1911, Jonathan Evans passed away in his 67th year. He was elected a Manager of this Corporation on 10th Month 12th, 1897, and continued in active service until his death. We shall always remember his as one who loved his fellow men, which trait endeared him to those with whom he came in contact. For many years he took a lively interest in all the out-door activites at the College and by frequent visits to the campus kept himself informed of the condition and needs of the grounds and buildings. On this account his judment on question that came before us was the more valuable because it was based on personal knowledge. He was personally known to many of the students, who were often helped by his affectionate sympathy with all their interests. His fellow Managers will truly miss his presence at their meetings, at which he was a faithful and regular attendant.***********

   My dear Algie
   
   Mary & I felt it kindest not to intrude on you today, being sure that you knew well how anxious we were to assist you at this sad time in anyway & that you would ask us, if we could do anything.
   
   As I sit writing at the desk that thy dear father & cousin Rachel gave us as a wedding present, many cherished memories of my associations with him & with you all come to me.
   
   First of all I remember the pleasure of his first cordial greeting when I visited you at Conanicut for the first time. How heartily he & you all took me right into your family, so that I have never since felt anyway not entirely at home in your house or enjoying your hospitality.Thy father was a revelation to me in his cheerfulness, his joviality & his kindness to those about him, always, it seemed to me, outdoing himself to give others pleasure, so often, too, just young boys & girls, some of whom, I fear, took a good deal of it for granted. His whole-hearted comradeship with his children & their friends, without ever descending from the character of a true Christian gentleman, has been of often & often an inspirtation to the and words cannot express what it has meant to me to be allowed by to share him so freely, for there always seemed plenty of him to go around to everyone at his board or in his presence.
   
   He & Cousin Rachel have been I have so often felt, much like a father & mother to me; I felt as free in talkingwith him as with my own father, & as sure of a sympathetic hearing. I shall never forget his wonderful kindness in coming up to Mt. Airy one evening at the time of Father's dearth & sitting with me & talking with the truest & most tender sympathy. It seemed too much for a man of his years to do for a young man, & yet nothing of the kind ever seemed too much for him appartently in his own eyes.
   
   Just these few things & his love that they & other incidents like them have engendered in me have been pressing for expressions since I we all were so sadly shocked on 7th day morning by news of Cousin Jonathan's condition & I hope that He will not think it a miss in me to have given them expression, for they have made me feel so close to him & to all of you that I have the most heartfelt sympathy for you all in this ordealso hard for you.
   
   It is a great joy to me to have known thy father as I did & also to know [thear?] so many others, allwho knew him, in fact, say the same thing.
   
   With sincere love & truly heart felt sympathy for thy dear Mother & Anna & thy brothers, I am, with love

   My dear friends
    Francis & Anna Cope,
   
   Those only who have passed thr'o a similar trial, can justly measure the affliction which is now your portion. So I find my heart going out in tender sympathy with yours and our earnest desire that he among whose gracious offices it still is to "heal the broken hearted", and "to comfort them that mourn", may be near to sustain & comfort you.
   
   To a loving parent, the right time never comes, as viewed from our standpoint, to part with a dear child. The infancy, its very tenderness & helplessness beget the care it is there so continually needing. As childhood comes with all its winsome ways, it is surely hard to give the little one up. And when mandhood or womanhood have been reached, and ourhopes brighten for their future, or we fondly look for ripenning fruit from all our care & anxiety & effort for their temporal & spiritual good, a feeling akin to bitter disappointment is mingled with the sorrow, as we bear them to the silent tomb.
   
    But the Christian believer has learned, not only thr'o observing the lots of others, but by his own happy experience, that a Heavenly Father, who "tender mercies are over all His works", and whose "compassions fail rest", knows best how to deal with us and our loved ones, and that "he doeth all things well".  Whether we understand the meaning of the dispenesation or not, we can thr'o our tears exclaim, "The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away, but blessed be the name of the Lord." This filial submission to the Will of God, we well know comes to us only thr'o the humbling, sweetening, calming influences of his grace. But I rejoice to believe you have known & felt its efficacious power, and I long that it may in this time of need, rest largely upon the spirits of you both.Some sweet lines by Charlotte Elliot, you may be already familiar with, but they seem so fitted for those who are passing this heavy trials, that I will add a few stanzas, th'o feeling sure you will appreciate them all.
   
    If those shouldst call me to resign
   What most I prize, it ne'er was mine:
   I only yield thee what was there;
   "Thy will be done".
   
   If but my fainting heart be blest
   With thy sweet spirit for its guest,
   My God! To thee I leave the rest,
   "Thy will be done"
   
   Renew my will from day to day;
   Blend it with thine, and take away
   All that now makes it hard to say,
   "Thy will be done."
   
   Then, when on earth I breathe no more
   The prayer half mixed with tears before,
   We sing, upon a happier shore,
   "Thy will be done"
   
   My lameness still keeps me a cripple,and almost house-bound, or I should gladly have been with you ere this, but the above may express, better perhaps than I could in person, the loving sympathy and desires of
   
   your attached friend,
   Saml Morris.

   My dearest Anna,
    
   When we last parted I had intended to fulfill my promise of writing to thee at a much earlier period than I have done, but my time has been so much occupied that I have found it impossible to do so, and trust thee will not attribute it to forgetfulness, as I can assure thee that although absent, thee is not forgotten. Several of the family have been very much indisposed, grandfather has indeed had quite a severe attack, we scarcely thought he would recover for a day or two, but he is now very much improved and able to be about his room. The weather has been so very warm, I expect you enjoy the country exceedingly there  are but a few persons now remaining in the city, the streets are quite deserted, great numbers have gone to Cape May and other watering places. I understood from a gentleman who had just returned from Saratoga Springs, that the Hotels there were very much crowded, about four hundred visitors at one house.
    
   I regretted exceedingly you were unable to hear Friend Gurney once more before his departure, I can scarcely realise that he has indeed left our native land forever, as he now supposes; there was a little girl inquired of him if he would never return here, and was almost broken hearted, when he placed his hand upon his head and replied, that "his docks were too grey ever to expect to revisit this country". I had several op-portunities of being in company with him and they were much more delightful on account of being unexpected.
   
   The First day morning before he left he attended the North Meeting, and gave us a very interesting and beautiful sermon, taking his text from the sixty third chapter of Isaiah, ninth Verse. After meeting Sister Mary and myself were returning home, when Friend Paul joined us and said, that she had fully expected we would have called to see Friend Gurney the evening before, that there was a number of friends and young people assembled at their house, between sixty and seventy she thought, to bid him Farewell, and insisted upon our going home with her; as she said that it would be our last oppurtunity, we accordingly accepted her invitation, highly grateful as thee may suppose. Our particular facourite E. P. Kirkbride was there when we arrived, and seveal other friends. Friend Gurney was very much pleased to see us, he said that he had been expecting us, and was very glad we had come, he seated himself close by us and conversed awhile very sweetly, after which we bade him adieu, wishing him a prosperous voyage and safe return, he sent his Love to all the family a kiss to the younger ones. He had an appointed meeting at the Arch Street house in the evening. (I was very much surprised a few days after to hear that you had not attended it). It was very large, he addressed us in a very interesting manner and furnished with a most touching prayer, in which he commended all his Endeared Friends, to the protection of that Saviour, who had so long sheltered him under his parent wing, and had been with him, in joy and in sorrow in this land."
   
   When the meeting had concluded, every one rushed to shake hands with him, I think he must have stood twenty minutesbidding all farewell, until I thought his hand really must ache however all were finally satisfied, and we had just returned home, when to our utter amazement who should arrive directly after, but Joseph John he said he must see us all once more, he sat a short time with us, and we then bade him adieu, although I trust it will not be forever. He sailed in "The Roseius" on the 25th, I shall be truly glad when I hear of his safe arrival at home, for surely his children and relations must ardently desire to behold him again, if he makes such an impression upon strangers what must their feelings be? I shall leave the remainder to thy imagination; I have written a long narrative about him my Dear Anna, supposing it would interest thee, if it does not thee must excuse the length of it, and not waste thy time in perusing it. I suppose thee has most probably heard of the death of Harry Collins, and Maria’s loss of her dear little babe, his namesake, so near the same time, poor girl she must feel it very deeply. Sister Susan and family have gone into the country expecting to remain three weeks. Cousin S. Cresson is no anxiously awaiting the arrival of her son Charles &c they intended sailing on the 25th in the "Great Western" for New York, I suppose they will arrive here in a week or ten days.
   
   Brother Wm is very anxious that some of us should take a trip through Pennslyvania, we had thought of going to Cape May for the benefit of the bathing the Dr. having recommended it for George, but Mama was so unwilling that he should be near the sea, we have concluded that a mountain ride, will perhaps be equally beneficial, I do not think it likely we shall be absent longer than a week. My letter has become so very lengthy, that I have only room to add do write me a very long letter and very soon, give my love to all inquiring friends of course reserving a lrage portion for thyself and hoping this will find you all in a perfect state of salubrity believe mestill thy sincerely attached friend and cousin
   
   Hannah S Vaux
   
   P.S. Please excuse all blunders and do not allow any one to read this but thyself. (A speedy answer Dear Anna).

   Dearest Mother, 
   
   Sunday and a large dinner having brought a temporary lull in the activities of our household I am going to get in a letter to thee before thee leaves Franconia. 
   
   With a jolly crowd, good weather and plenty to do we are enjoying ourselves very much and if only thee and Anna were here with us we could ask for little to make things complete. But since that may bot be we are rejoicing that we shallor at least some of us, see you before long at Batemans. 
   
   Since a week ago yesterday we have kept moving at quite a rapid gait, leaving for the most part out of doors and hence cultivating large healthy appetites. Plates are busy, I can tell thee, passing up and down the "festive board", and as for the butter words fail. Of course our for us of entertainment are not so tremendously varied but they are good ones and hence we do not grow tired of repeating. We generally start out the day by playing some good active to properly shake our breakfast down and to put ourselves proper frame of mind for a swim and  when this is attained we descend like "wolves on the fold" of those good friends of ours, the Whitalls, who in spite of our filling up their boat house and bath house still seem to preserve their equanimity of temper. For which let us be truly thankful, for really I don't know how we could get along without our good swim off their pier. 
   
    Sailing is our principal other pastime and we have had several good times in the faithful "Three Sisters". However, as we only hire the boat four days out of seven there are times when we must occupy ourselces in other ways. One of those days last we went on a picnic to Beaver Tail and had a splendid time the large express wagon up the Newport Transfer Co. sevred as our charist and pulled by four large horses kept in a gallop most of the way by our energetic driver we must I'm sure have made an imposing spectacle. The little cove where we usually go took on quite a homelike cozy air as it's walls reflected back the glow of our blazing bonfire round  which we sat while some of the musical members entertained us. I think I enjoy our Beaver Tail picnics more than any others. Still whereI think of one we had only yesterday over on the mainland near where the boys once camped in narrow River I am tempted to qualify that statement. 
   
   The Family Emlen are qutie prevalent here this Sunday Sam and Art have come up over labor Day, Sam staying here and Art at the Kimbers while Cousins Ellie and George are just across the way from us. It is very nie to have so many friends here. 
   
   I am sorry that my long delay in writing has this time not even an excuse of verse but a mother's forbearance is so easily imposed on, that I hope thee will forgive me once more I am very glad thee liked the poem. By the way, I never told thee that I would be very glad to hear what Miss Simpson has to say about my studying law. 
   
   With a great deal of love to ann and thyself. 
   
   Thy affectionate son
   Edward

   Sunday, July 16, 1911
   
   Dear Aunt Lilly, 
   
   I want to thank thee very, very much for thy letter to me, so full of love and sympathy and helpful thought for Jack and me and for us all. Thee knows, I am sure, how glad we all are of the assurance that the miles which separate us cannot prevent the, being with us in spirit, nor us with thee. I am sure this experience of sudden and great sorrow has given us all, (and many, also, I think, outside our family circles), a new vision of the sacredness and beauty of these lives of ours however commonplace their daily rounds may seem and to me, I think, the greatest inspiration of all comes from the thought of how dear Ern's spirit by the dark, faithfulness of his unselfishness, which all who knew him felt, was unconsciouslygrowing to that wonderful capacity for selflessness which he so beautifully displayed in those last hours. I know he would be the last one to wish praise that was not due or ever praise at all but he would rejoice for us all together from this experience and to go forward with more and more steadfast faithfulness to the light that is given us. 
   
   It is lovely being up here all together in the quiet peace  of the woods and hills with Frank and Ev and I wish we had thee, too. Woodbourne is almost like another home to me. 
   
   Harold, I am sorry to say, had to leave us today, but he went I am sure much the better for his eight days here and enjoyed it all very much. You are all very good to take us in so generously. 
   
   I have read Jack's note and see that she has mentioned that this is Ernest's Birthday. I think we all feel much as she says about his appreciation of Woodbourne and  love of nature. 
   
    Mother and Anna seem wonderfully well, I think, and it has been very good for Alg, too. The weather is very pleasant, a delightful breeze keeping the hilltop cool and fresh today. 
   
    Alg is the only other member of the family about us now and he sends a great deal of love to thee and to you all. I join warmly in his message with a special one of love to Ell. And please tell her how much her letter meant to us all. How I wish she were here with us now! 
   
    We were very sorry to hear of Uncle Tom's loss on the way up. We did, indeed appreciate having him with us at Awbury and all he did for us. 
   
   Thy very affectionate nephew
   Edward.

March 13th 1901
   
   Dear Mother-
   As things are very slack in here today I think it will be a good chance to write thee even tho I think there is almost nothing new to be told.  Last night Aunt Lilly & the girls turned up all right.  Father & I went over to see Aunt Lilly & Ellie in the evening and they seemed to have stood the journey very well.  We have been having a great time arranging about the Shakespeare Class.  When we received on 2nd day a letter from Aunt Lilly saying that it was very doubtful if they could get parlor car seats for 3rd day and that unless they could certainly have three seats before they started they would not come up until 4th day as Mary & Ellie very likely would be too tired to come; and when at the Tea meeting Esther said she did not feel like coming we became very much more doubtful about the wisdom of trying to have the class In fact father was so discouraged that he said he didnt "care whether it ever met or not" and that I could so as I pleased so I decided to put it off a week to let the Hackers and Annie Day know about our change of plans which I did with apologies.  Then last night when we found that Mary & Ellie would be able to come we again had misgivings, so over we trotted to Ls.  Ellie encouraged us to have it this week at their house, as Harold having the measles might scare some of them from coming, so once again we wrote to the Hackers & A. de P. telling them of the final arrangement.  I am almost afraid now to see them!!!  Aunt Lilly has enjoyed her trip immensely and it has done her a lot of good I have no doubt.  She certainly looks very well & is full of [---] while away. 
   
   As father no doubt has told thee we went down to the Tea meetingon 2nd day & had a very nice time.  I enjoyed it very much tho the room was very hot & stuffy in the evening when the papers were being read so that I was very sleepy & could not, I am afraid, pay very strict attention to all that was being said.  Still I got something out of it & enjoyed the tea very much.  On 6th day 2
   
   evening Ed & I went over to a small party at the Whitalls.  Greta had home Marion Lane who is in her class and had asked Letitia Wright the Emlens, Jay Brown & Billy Kimber to come over.  We had a very nice time tho nothing at all thrilling.  On our way over I picked up a $10 gold piece on Church Lane in front of the Storks!  I have never had any luck that way before & could hardly believe my eyes.  I looked for any advertisements for it but could find none.  On 1st day I enquired I enquired of them at Church Lane but none of them had lost any money.  I asked Henry if Morris Bockins had lost anything as I thought he might carry some gold but Henry had not heard of him losing anything.  In the afternoon therefore Ed & I started over to Boltons to advertise the Ledger but left doing it on our way over as the boy at Boltons said it did not have to be sent before 5.30 to get in 2nd days paper.  When we got over to the Stokes Henry announced that the owner of my $10 was a poor woman in Irishtown.  I thought he was only kidding but he said that he had seen Morris Bockins after meeting & had asked him whether he had lost any money.  Mr B. said that he had not lost any directly but a poor boy who was coming over to his house from Irishtown with the [---], had been unable to curb his curiosity to look at the money which his mother had given him & his looking at it had dropped a $10 gold piece which he had search diligently for but had been unable to find where upon he was so much over came that he had run home at once.  The next morning his mother had come over & told how her son had lost the money & that her husband had looked for it very early the next morning but had been unable to find it & that consequently she could pay her rent.  The poor woman he said was very much broken up about her loss.  As these facts entirely agreed with what I knew3
   
   about the $10 there was no doubt but that the woman was the owner of the money, which is very satisfactory as there would probably have been a good many people who would have flocked to me if I had advertised and it might have been hard to tell who really did own it.  I am certain now that the right person got the money & am very glad that she has it!  Well I have written a great deal about this coin but there thee knows the likes details in letters thee says!  On 7th day our bowling club met & we had a very good time.  I enjoyed it especially as I bowled the highest score I have made this year.  Harold seems to be coming on slowly.  I am expecting very likely to get the disease as no one  seems to be very careful about keeping the doors shut but I guess it wouldnt make much difference.  It dont hardly seem worth while however to go over to grandpas as I think I have been exposed to it already.  Still we'll see what the doctor says.  I am very glad thee is enjoying thyself in a great way & hope it is doing thee a great deal of good.  Aunt lilly & Ellie talked to Anna over the phone just before they started (perhaps it was 2nd day night) & she sent her love to us all. 
   
   I am thy loving son
   Algernon

   Dearest Mother
   It seems rather absurd to start to write to you so soon after you started but by my calculations it will have to be written tonight in order to catch you on your arrival as I will not be able to [---] tomorrow night and this must go by 4th days boat.  I suppose that as you will have fully recovered from any bad effects of the voyage when this reaches you it will be ok for my to express my present wonderings about your present condition.  I hope that you are not wishing like Ellie Garrett did that you were like a woman in Boston who hadnt any stomach.  I dont believe you are tho it is not so very long since you started and I am afraid that there is a chance that in spite of all opinion plaster;s etc the sea may still have its effects on certain ones, I wont mention names!  Well we are having not delightfully cool weather now.  It is simply great here at home but I can just hear those at Woodbourne and at Jamestown comment on their blessings in having it so cool and sigh for those of us who have to stay ay [---] in "that awful heat."  Well poor things it makes them feel a sight happier and it dont hurt us.  We have just had a circus of a time with a couple of fox terrier pups wich uncle Hazen invited in.  He has been keeping them down at the stable during his absense and Uncle Thomas' household have had a perfectly charming time with their midnight serenades.  Tonight he came home & brought them down here and they didnt do a thing but get themselves and every body else tied up and during supper time they raised perfect cane barking.  UncleHazen had to rush out a couple times to see the cause of the rumpus and now he has put them down in the cellar and because they are quiet now thinks he has solved the problem of keeping them quiet!  I have my doubts but am not saying anything just yet a while.  Grandpa and Uncle T. did not come down today after all.  Uncle Hazen received a telegram today saying that they would be down on 4th day.  I rather expect that Uncle Hazens stage party which comes off tomorrow night has rather discouraged them tho I dont know anything about it.  I did nothing during thr 4th except go over to Ros[---] in the evening and see them send off a lot of fireworks which were very good considering they were private.  The Goodhue kids were great sports.  Little [---] nearly turned inside out when a rocket or bomb went off.  On 7th day I took a Sabbath day journey out to Moorestown and played cricket which turned out desasterously to us as we were beaten 162 to 50 of which I made 10.  I stayed out at Moorestown with Stodgell Stokes to supper and had a very pleasant visit with them.  I had never been there before and enjoyed seeing them much.  Dr & Mrs Stokes inquired after you all.  I had intended to get out to Joes Morris' to stay over 1st day but I could not get in town in time to get out to Villa Nova before very late so I came home.  On 1st day I went to Frank Goodhues to dinner and in the evening went to Emlens to supper.  On 6th day Evening I went down to Shoemakers to see Anna & Frank Fortunately they were at home and I had a very nice visit.  Tomorrow Anna Hacker, Mary Jones, Annie Williams, Frank Stokes, Frank Strawbridge & myself are going up to Willow Grove.  I guess we will have pretty good time.  Tell Ed that I tried to getsomething for ASM but all the stores were closed before I got there at the Girard namely [---].  I will try & do it tomorrow.  I have not heard anything definite about my vacation yet but I guess I can have it sometime in Aug.  I am fine & well so dont be [---] of those who bother about the heat.  Give my love to Anna Ed Es. and with a great deal for thyself I am as ever thy loving son Alg.

   Dear Mother
   My letters do not seem to have any regular time for going to thee this summer and I cant remember when I last wrote but this is to tell thee about Aunt Lizzie Cope.  Thee probably has heard that she was not so well lately and on 2nd day Grandpa and uncle Tom went down for the day to Ventnor to see her.  They found that she was, as they had expected, much worse than when she left Awbury tho she was very glad to see them.  She had a great deal of 2
   
   trouble breathing.  Yesterday morning they up at uncle Thomas received a telegram from down there saying that she was worse and later on in the morning another one came saying that she had pneumonia which of course made them fear the worst.  Late in the afternoon another message came that she had quietly passed away at about 4 oclock in the afternoon.  Cousin Madgie, Ellie & John were all down there at the time and cousin Harry & Walter went down in the afternoon.  I did not know anything about it until late last night when I came home from the Harris (Joes) where a lot of us were at a porch party so that I did not get a  3
   
   Chance to write until this morning.  Grandpa, uncle Tom also had very little time to write as Cousin Eliza came over to supper (as cousin Walter had gone down) and Ridlgley Brown had also been asked to supper.  I do not know any thing further as of course we have not heard anything more.  I dont know when the funeral will be. 
   
   As I said before she had been much weaker lately and her heart not been as strong so that they were very much concerned about her tho the Dr did not give up hope as she said you could not tell in heart cases how long a person might live.  When Grandpa was down on 2nd day they did not know that she had pneumonia tho she was much worse than she had been.  She was up 4
   
   when they saw her.  She had a bad night and in the morning the Dr said she had pneumonia and did not look for her to recover.  I do not know how she took cold. 
   
   I have been having a great deal going on in a special way lately so that I have not had a chance to do all the things I have wanted to do,- one of which was to may Joe Morris a visit.  Alf & Henry are out there now but Joe & Ev go up to Woodbourne [---] about the 1st.  I have not time to write more at present.  Things certainly have kept moving this summer & I have had a mighty good time.  We are all very well.  Please give my love to Anna, with lots for thyself  I am as ever thine

   Dearest Mother
   I am very sorry I have been so long in answering thy letter but after Edw wrote and told thee about father I did not feel it nearly so much as my mind tho I have been walking to work and tell thee that thy letter was much appreciated and also to let thee know that I still remembered there was such a person even tho I did not write.
   
   Last week in spite of the fact that we no longer had the  rummage sale on our minds was pretty full.  On 2nd day we had our "Discipline Class" & on 3rd day Frank Ev & I read as usual.  The baby has not been as well as she might be, having had a slight [bilious?] attack.  So she has been a little more fruitful during the day tho she has been very good indeed when I have been over there in the evenings.  Ev also has not been very well as she has had a mild attack of hives which have however now passed away I believe.  While I am on the health of their family I might add that they heard the other daythat Ell has been right sick having had an attack of Gripp and there after getting better having a relapse from which I think she is now recovering.  It is too bad that she should have been sick just as this time, especially as they are getting ready to move.  but it is a good thing that Aunt L is down there to look after them.  To continue the health bulletin- Father seems to be pretty well and cheerful tho his ankle does not seem to get much better tho he [---] it.  He drives a great deal and occassionally goes out to supper & dinner (I dont know how much he goes out to dinner).  We have not had very much company in the evening tho Davis came up one night and Frank & Betty were over on 5th day night which Father enjoyed.  I expect it would be good for him if we had some more company but it seems very hard to find a time when we have not got engagements.
   
   Yesterday Joe Morris & I went up to the Rancocas and canoed.  It was a very fine day in the morning and a pretty good afternoon tho a little disappointing after the way the day started.  We had a first class time by ourselves and came home with that comfortable tired sleepy feeling.  The main reason for our going was that I wanted to ship our canoe & Sam Emlen's up to Browns Mills so that we can come down the stream next 6th day which is Good Friday and therefore a holiday.  A big crowd of people which Natalie and Elsie have asked are also going up to Browns Mills to stay over Easter and Ernest expects tobe one of them.  Edw. & I were not asked as the girls seem to think that new blood is needed which sounds very well.  I dont know exactly who all are going with them but the ladies are Natalie Elsie Mildred Sue Margaret [Werner] Katharine Buffum Eliz [Weston?], the fellows are Art, Bill, Ernest, and some other new bloods I am not certain who all. 
   
   I dont know certainly who of us are coming down in canoes but Ed & I will probably be in one boat & Sam & Marion in the other.  Tho the latter are always more or less uncertain now!  Thee knows they are expecting to married in June and Sam has asked Edw & myself to be ushers.  By the way Ed wishes me to thank thee for him for thy letter and also to give thee his love.  Harold is down at Atlantic City, or rather in transit from Atlantic City I suppose, and Ernest has taken Esther Emlen over to the Shoemakers to heat some singing so they can not send their love.  This morning I stopped for a few minutes at Uncle Franks and saw Esther.  She seemed very bright & well.  Ed stayed over there to dinner and then returned and took a drive with father while Frank & I went on a good long tramp. 
   
   Please excuse the writing blotts spelling etc for I am feeling rather sleepy & careless tho it is not late at all, the clock just having struck 9.30.  I think I will however call this to a close & go to bed which I know will please thee.  I have been getting to bed often much earlier than usual lately!!  Please give a great deal of my love to Anna & remember me to Miss R.  It will be very nice to see you all again.  With great deal of love for thyself I am always thine

   Dear Mother
   I am going to try to mend my ways and write thee a real letter!  Thee sees thee suffers from the fact thee is so good natured about our short comings.  I am afraid I sometimes write to other members of the family and not to thee because I think thee will understand it is not because I do not love thee I do not write.  I guess thee does understand this but likes to hear all the same.
   
   I was surprised to hear thee started so soon for North East Harbor and I hope that gay house party did not wear thee out so thee was not rested enough to go.  I hope at any rate thee will have a Chance to get rested at North East.  It is too bad thee has had so much trouble with thy knee but perhaps a change of air will be good for it.  I understand it is rheumatism- isnt it?  There seems to be a great deal of it around.  The other day- last 7th day it was- I had planned with Ernest to take a walk in the afternoon but suddenly in the middle of the morning a little rheumatism settled in my knee and it got quite sore so we went up to the Rancocas and canoed.  I cured mine in a jiffy by rubbing it that night with [---] which I think is fine stuff.  Has thee tried it on thy knee?  I think it might help it. 
   
   Last night I very unexpectedly went up the Valley to the Roberts with Edward Jack & Joe.  We had a very good time.  Elizabeth Perot came over to supper and helped keep things moving.  She has been having quite a bad time with rheumatism in one of her eyes but it is much better now.  We spent the night and retuned to Phila this morning. 
   
   Tonight Ernest & I are expecting to go to Uncle Franks to supper and tomorrow we start for Woodbourne on the Black Diamond which gets us up there in time for supper.  I am sorry that Evelyn fine stuff.  Has thee tried it on thy knee?  I think it might help it.

   Tonight Ernest & I are expecting to go to Uncle Franks to supper and tomorrow we start for Woodbourne on the Black Diamond which gets us up there in time for supper.  I am sorry that Evelyn will not be up there but I am looking forward with much pleasure to seeing the others.  I do not think Edw has planned to go away over the end of the week so he will be out at [Dimdale?]. 
   
   Next week I suppose will bring quite a change in the numbers at Germantown as people generally have to come home about the 10th.  It has been very quiet since we came back from the [---] and it will be nice to see some more people around once again. 
   
   I suppose the family will stay up at Jamestown until some time about the 23rd though I have not heard any date mentioned.  Harold said he expected to come home about the 10th to do some work By the way I got from the barrel of Educators over at Grand[---] 5lbs the other day.  I do now know how much they are a lb. & I wonder whether thee would mind settling with uncle Tom for them.  I only took 5lbs as the barrel  was pretty empty and I thought I had better have some in it.  I think there are about 5lbs left. 
   
   Family affairs move along very quietly and very reasonably smoothly.  Occassionally our fair Margaret gets a little ruffled under the collar but we have had nothing serious happen at all.  As her second childhood is coming on she gets more and more  forgetful so that sometimes I think it will not be long before we  will be summoned to table and find it almost unused.  The other night she admitted supper was late because she had put the lima beans on to cook but when she went to take them off she found nothing but boiling water as she had forgotten to put the beans in the pot!!  It does very nicely for summer time when no one is in a hurry but it would be a little annoying if such things happened when we are busy. 
   
   The days are getting so short now we do not have much chance to play tennis unless we get an early start and as Ernest does not  get out of town until the 505 at the earliest we have not played much.  Edw and I however had a little practice.  We have also been kept from playing by a great deal of [---] cool,- almost cold,- weather.  Yesterday it rained very hard but has cleared up Today and I hope we will have clear weather over the end of the weak, though we will have a very good time no doubt even if the skies are cloudy.
   
   Please give a great deal of love to Grandma.  And with the same for thyself I am
   Thy loving son
   Algernon
   
   Also please give my love to uncle T. (over) P.S.
   I almost again forgot to thank thee for those very pretty little needle & thread holders which thee sent Harold & me.  We really appreciated them very much and they were most convenient to have.

   My beloved sister
   I feel as tho' I wanted to send thee another greeting before you leave Newport, thy last letter was very welcome with its good report of your welfare, I trust you have all continued in good case & will return home strengthened for the cares & duties of the winter.  As to dear little Edward, I do not suppose we shall know him, nor doubt he has changed much, I hope he will make up his mind to take food when he really needs it, perhaps he may take to a cup & spurn if a bottle is too insulting to his dignity.  Rebekah Smith's little boy is growing nicely & is a cute baby with the large dark eyes, your children ought to our ideas, & tho' his fractures are rather too large now for baby beauty he promises to develope that trait after awhile; at present his great charm is his good behavior, which is a real comfort to his mamma as her nurse left her sooner than she wished & she has only a young girl to assist her in taking care of him.  I suppose it will not be very long now before you are turning your faces homeward & it will be pleasant to think of your bring near us.  tho' we shall not see one another for awhile.  I am glad to hear from a letter to Katharine from Jthat you will not move into your own house until the 11th month, as I would like to be on hand at that season, having a fancy for such dissipations.  I have seen allusions in the papers to the burning of The Cliff House, but have not seen any account of the event, what a favor you were not there! & how about the boarders, did they lose their things was anyone hurt, poor Mrs Emmons I hope she was not there, (or thy Aunt Lizzie).  By the way what do you hear of the latter.  I trust her trip to England has been of use to her, when do you expect her back.  I am sorry to hear that Hazen is not very strong, perhaps he did too much, it seemed a very short time to be absent.  Since our last letter to thee we have had a visit from Susan Kito & Amy Roberts, they are bothundemonstrative people, especially Susan, but they enjoyed being here I think, SK was not well & did not like to ride so we had a quiet time, reading, talking, examining flowers & looking at objects in the compound microscope, one of Frank's late investments; they took tea at sister Eleanor's & also at Joshua's.  Sister Eleanor's summer home was vacated on 3rd day, she, Tom, Ellie, & Walter drove home with the two horses & carriage she spent one night at Arondale & one at HM Stokes at Chester & reached Germantown on 5th day evening.  Hetty & Wistar have gone to "Uncle Gideon's" & Betty is staying with us; the stay down here has been a real succes, the children have been very well & happy, have found much to interest & occupy them.Wistar & Franky have spent many hours in "bug hunts" & do manifest much zeal in the collection of beetles, butterflys & moths, & really have quite a large number; we labor under great difficulty as far as the study of the subject is concerned, as we have no books on Entomology except one by [Wood?] which treats of British insects, I quite want to get some good work & be able to learn the names of some of the creatures the boys have.  I have wandered away from my starting point, sister Eleanorfound the quiet of the country life & the absense of the many demands on her time & thoughts that she has to meet in Germantown a great rest, & altho' the house has not much to attract as regards situation it did not make the same difference to her it would to us, as she is so fond of riding she was out almost daily & enjoyed taking others drives.  Thee may remember Katharine & I find great comfort in sitting under the trees or lying in the hammocks when not busy sewing.  I suppose Hetty will stay down some weeks yet, her trip to Mt [Desert?] brokeinto her summer & I think she dont feel at all ready to leave Maryland.  John & Walter came down yesterday with Frank but dont expect to make much of a visit as they talk of going back tomorrow.  We heard a report that Sophy Kimber was to be married at Newport this summer, does thee know if it is so, her certificate has been sent on from 12th st, we shall miss her from Germantown she is so efficient & willing.  Now my dear sister when thee writes, which I hope may be [---] long, please tell us how thee is, Katharine wishes to know if thee has picked up any fat in the cool air, how does thy nurse geton, I hope she has proved an efficient help.  It is raining quite heavily now, which is not as acceptable as at some seasons, but when I think how we have longed for it in former days I dont like complaining.  The season of canning has arrived & folks in this part of the country are busy enough putting up corn, tomatoes & peaches &c, I should feel dubious about eating the products of some of the factories, as they employ Bohemians whose cleanliness is more than doubtful.  We were quite startled to see the death of Mary Morton yesterday, she spent a few days with Rebekah some 2 weeks ago, but was not well then & wished to get to Phila, it is such a favor she went up when she did or she might have died here.  Please give my love to thy mother & Lilly, kiss the dear children for me & accept for thyself a message of warmaffection from thy attached sister K sends love Hannah B. Evanscan thee tell us anything of the Newhalls.  Ive not heard from A for some time & fear her mother is more poorly.

Dr says Katy is holding her own very well, her temperature is rather lower this morning than at the same time yesterday.  101 today & her skin more natural.  She slept a good deal last night, but does not seem quite so drowsy this morning & therefore more conscious of her discomforts.  Dear child she gets discouraged  at times, the days seem so long.  I was writing for a tooth brush but Katharine says Katy has just got a nice soft one.  Sam sent us down a press for the beef, so we can get the juice out with less labor.  I hope Ernest is doing well, my love to Rachel & the others at Newport.  With love thine truly

   My dear sister
   
   I am once more at home and quite miss hearing of thy welfare and dear Anna's from Jonathan's letters.  I hope you still continue to gain and enjoy the mountain air.  When I got home last 2nd day, I felt very much used up with the heat & the change in air, but now have become accustomed to it and feel quite well, tho' the amount of moisture in the air makes things damp & sticky.  No doubt thee has heard particulars of E.W. Copes last hours, the close must have been very peaceful, both Ellie & Madgie express their feelings of thankfulness that their mother did not have to endure long confinement and great suffering.  The funeral was small, so many are away, S. Morris and E Allen bore testimony to her character, there was nothing said at the grave but there was such a sweet, quiet feeling as we stood silently there in the evening lights, everything looking so beautiful & peaceful, words did not seem to be needed.  E. Allen said after meeting today to Eleanor & me, that after sheheard of E.W. Copes death she went into her room and such a sweet feeling came over her, she felt it was a forecast of the rest & peace into which Elizabeth Cope had entered.  I rode to the ground with cousin Rebecca Evans, she spoke of cousin Elizabeth, said the letter thee wrote her had been such a particular comfort and help to her, that Rebecca had felt she must write & tell thee but has been rather burdened with calls, so I said I would let thee know about it, I think R sent her love to thee.  Will & Grace have both had mumps, and little Mary, (Alice'sdaughter) has been very sick, she is now gaining down at the Dennis and Grace has been there with them.  Cousin Wm & John Rhoads have gone to T. Brown's camp for their vacation.  I send thee one of Esthers letters as thee may be interested to hear something of the Conference.  It seems to have been a time of spiritual refreshment & uplifting & I hope may prove of use to the building up of the Church.  Eleanor says the spirit of love & unity was very marked, Alfred urged that all [---] and feelings of antagonism between old & young, conservative & progressive should be laidaside, which seemed to be the case.  Alfred seems to feel his mind relieved of the concern, he went back to Bupshire yesterday & is going on to Northfield.  Frank Goodhue also went to Bupshire will spend today there & go on to Brattleboro taking little Mary with him.  Edith Silver came up on 5th day eve, it was very pleasant to see her, she went home yesterday, Betty & little Elizabeth & Sam Mason all went with her.  Betty intends spending a couple of weeks at Swallowfield where she hopes to have a good rest.  Francis Jr is at Bupshire so all the children are cared for.  Sister Eleanor & Tom I believe are going to Bupshire soon & Wistar to the South on business so the house will be deserted  for awhile.  Katy & the childrenpropose coming home on 3rd day.  Frank came on to the funeral but went back last night, I am glad for him to have a visit there.  Emma Edwards fell in her house and broke her hip, she is now very ill not expected to live & her life is not to be [---] under the circumstances.  I had an active time last week attending meetings but got on better than I expected to, tomorrow is Phila Quarterly Mg & 5th day ours, after that I shall take a rest and do a little here at home, as I see many things that need looking after.  I dont know when Esther will come home probably in about a week.  A great deal of love to dear Anna & also for thyself from thy attached sister

   My dearest Algie,
   I think thee is awfully good to keep on writing me such perfect letters, and when I got the last one, which was a dandy by the way, I just decided that thee deserved a letter and was going to get one too.  I suppose thee is up at Woodbourne now, having a fine time with Frank.  I can just imagine you getting up at some unearthly hour of the morning and kicking up such a row, so that nobody else can possibly sleep, because you have caught a mouse or some other poor little animal in a figure four.  I bet Aunt Carrie was mad when you waked her up, I remember she always used to be.  Tell Frank I was very much shack[---] to hear of his playing such a wicken trick on Aunt Carrie.  I hope he has been severely lectured for it.  I think he must be getting very wild.  I wish he would write me a letter, but I suppose he has so many other girls to write to he would hardly have time to spare a few minutes to me.  I suppose thee sees from the top of thisletter that we are in Venice at present, and I wish I could change places with thee for a minute or two, and let thee see what it is like.  I am not very good at describing things, as I guess thee knows by this time, if thee has [wadded?] through many of my stupid letters, however, I will do my best.  In the first place it is very beautiful and very different from anything else that I ever saw, or that anybody ever saw I guess.  The Gondolas are perfectly fascinating.  They are all painted black, and are long and narrow, with pointed ends curled up.  That's graphic, isn't it?  Never mind, I am going to draw thee a picture of one.There it is!  Thee sees the man stands at the back and works the boat with one oar.  It is more like paddling than anything else, only the man stands up and throws himself forward on  the oar each time.  It is a very graceful motion, and they do it beautifully feathering the oar each time.  I never saw anything like the way in which they guide the great long boats in and out among each other, and around sharp corners, without any collissions.  It is really wonderful.  Oh!  Algie!  Thee gave me such a scare about Colin.  I really criedwhen I heard he was lost.  and when I read thy next letter and found it was all right, I was too delighted for words.  Why I hardly said good-bye to the old fellow, and to think of not seeing him again nearly broke my heart.  Wasn't it queer his going off that way.  I hope he wont do it again.  We have gotten some lovely letters since I stopped writing and amoung them  was a paper tellingall about the Tennis Tournament, which Papa had sent to me.  I enjoyed reading it immensely, & got very much excited over the descriptions of the different matchs.  I felt almost as if I was there seeing them.  Some of them must have been fine.  I would love to have seen the one between Hovey and young Sears, it must have been awfully exciting.  I am sorry poor Huntington was not in it this year.  I am awfully glad he won the doubles anyway.  Campbell must have played beautifully and you must just have held your breaths all through the matchbetween him and Hobart.  From what I gathered it was intensely exciting, wasn't it?  I can just imagine how sorry you were when Hovey was beaten.  I know how broken hearted I was when Huntington was done up last year.  It must have been something the same, at least it says that Hovey gave out entirely in the end, and evidently was not well, and that was just the way with Huntington.  Now Algie, I must stop.  I guess thee is sick of hearing me talk about the tournament and will not be very sorry.  Good-night old boy!  Take a great big kiss and hug and all the love thee wants from
   Thy very, very loving Sister. P.S. Please give my best love to Agnes, and tell her I am waiting eagerly for a letter from her.  Why don't it come?  Give Ellie my love too, and tell her she is a perfect jewel to write to me, and that I will try and answer it if I can find time.

Title: 1875 November 28, Church Lane, to brother

Church Lane 11 mo 28. 75
   
   My dear brother
   
   Having received a message from thee through a letter to Tom, and not being able to plead sickness as a reason for not writing, I am going to send thee a greeting-  Well we are not going to see thee until next spring, it seems a long time, and we were all of us not a little disappointed when the news came.  We were counting the days until the time when thee was to sail and beginning to speculate upon the probable length of the passage, when suddenly all our hopes were dashed-  I was going to say I would not flatter thee by telling thee what lamentations there were on the part of some of us, but I think it does no one harm to know how much they are loved and missed at home, on the contrary I think  to a young man it does good, tending perhaps to keep him out of some things by which he might otherwise be tempted-  Now for the scrape of news I can glean up-  Last fourth day Tom and I drove over to Haverford to bring away thy [chattels?]-  We arranged to go on third day, but on that day we had a regular old fashioned Nor'easter and it poured most of the day-  The next morning about nine oclock Tommy appeared at our house in the [---] with Lady and Eric (Harry having been laid up some time with sore feet) after getting some more warm wraps for it had cleared off quite cold when we started-  The roads were in a pretty miserable state of muddiness and as we undertook to go by the Lancaster road we almost stuck so to speak-  However we reached the College about half past eleven, and finding the students in recitation we went up stairs and explored-  We found all thy things had been moved out of thy room and were locked up in another closet of which the matron hadkey so she had to be hunted up-  We packed most of the books and some other things in a drawer which Tommy and I carried down to the front door Tommy saying it was "like carrying down a little coffin"-  We donated to Frank Haines a bottle of eye wash, a little bottle of carbolic acid and a few other valuables?-  Thus were the last rites performed-  We packed the books in the bottom of the wagon, and put the precious articles, around with we supposed tender associations ( clung , (a broken fan with names thereon &c) between folds of the down cover-  We drove home to dinner reaching Awbury about quarter of four-  We had a good laugh at Tom - one of the objects over was to bring home the hanging book shelf and we forgot all about it, and came home without it - which rankled in Tommy's breast-  By the way talking of Haverford does thee know they have raised a sufficient amount of money to enable them to build, and Samuel Alsop Jr told me it was decided to go ahead-  The day we werethere was the day before Thanksgiving day, and as I waited upstairs in the entry while Tom was hunting up the Matron I was amused at two of the students, one was in the hall down stairs and as the other came out I suppose from recitation - he announced the fact that they were going to have Turkey for dinner, whereupon there went up such a howl of rejoicing as almost upset me-  We hoped while at Haverford to have had time to have called upon Margaret Yarnall, but we spent to much time at Any Marys that we had not time.  I suppose you have heard that Ellis and M Yarnall are boarding at [---] during the Winter.  I am glad to hear they are vert comfortably fixed-  It seems an out of the way kind of place for them, a good deal away from most of the latter's friends, I should think she would long to have her daughter with her.  I do feel for them very much-  First day 12/5.  A week, my dear Afred, has passed since I commenced this letter yet it is not finished.5
   During the week we have been pained from day to day to hear of Uncle Alfred's increasing illness.  As early as the beginning of the week Dr Wister said he seemed to be failing, and on second day they telegraphed for James, they received an answer the next morning only saying "will come" and that is all they have heard.  Up to second day Uncle Alfred has been able to get over into the library, this he has accomplished with the aid of a man who has been staying with him at night for a number of weeks- assisting him to dress and undress.  One second day he was so much weaker that he had to remain in bed- and since then he has been gradually growing weaker and weaker, until yesterday afternoon about three o'clock he quietly passed away-  He does not seem to have had any acute disease-  His appetite almost entirely gave out, and he gradually weakened - with the exception of a pain in one of his lungs I do not think he has suffered any-  Since last first day Uncle Tom and John E Carter have been sitting up with him half of alternate nights, the nurse sitting up the other half.  Lilly and Edward have been staying over at Fairfield for the last day or two-  Yesterday morning having heard how he was the evening before Father, Uncle Tom and Aunt Lizzie went over there, the Doctor came soon after they arrived and said he did not think he could live but a few minutes.  They went up into his room (except Father who had gone on to town) and sat there for two hours awaiting the close- he seemed entirely conscious but lay perfectly still excepting once when he passed his hand through his hair as his custom was and once he put his hand under his head-  They went to dinner and a few minutes after dinner was over he passed away, no one but Aunt Rebecca, Lily and Edward being present.  Just at the close, there was a short spasm and then to him all was joy and peace and rest-  What a wonderful and glorious change it must be for him after a long life of ill health and suffering during which I suppose he could never have said he really felt well, to awake inthat Holy City none of whose inhabitants can say I sick and where "there shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, neither shall there be ay more pain: for the former things are passed away"-  Aunt Caroline seems to feel it very much, not having seen for some time except a few days ago, when hearing how sick he was she went out to see him, but ut was thought best for her not to go in the room or let him see her so she looked at him through the door-  The only remarks I have heard that Uncle Alfred made (though he probably said more which I have not heard) were that some days ago he told J.E.C. "that it made very little difference which way it ended" meaning his sickness-  To E. Allen who visited home within a few days, and as she was leaving said she supposed she should never see him on earth again and that she did not doubt but that the change would be a glorious one to him he replied "I have been forced to feel very quiet and peaceful"  I think those were the words he used-  The funeral is to be next third day at two oclock.  It will be a great trial I doubt not to James to find all over when hearrives - 
   
   Last sixth day Uncle Tom commenced his winter readings and it was said to have been a very interesting occasion-  Neither Chellie nor I was able to get there-  There is a good deal of stir in our City now over the meetings of Moody & Sankey-  They have fitted up the old freight depot of the Pennsylvania RR so that it will seat about eleven thousand and meetings are being held I think twice on week days and three times on first days - they are largely attended and from accounts some of them must be impressive.  I hope they may do good-
   
   I suppose Mother in her weekly letter told you that Hazen had sprained his ancle, turned it under him as he was rushing out of the side door to catch the train-  Tommy seems to think it was a mercy he sprained it as it will probably save him from something worse if he will only take warning.  He had to hold it up for nearly a week.  However he is about again now tho he says it feels weak.  Aunt Lizzie Brown is still down at Atlantic City where she has been for some 9
   weeks and from accounts does not seem much better.  Aunt Fanny went down last third day taking with her a maid to stay with aunt Lizzie-  I am afraid her sickness is a pretty serious one and not to be gotten over in a hurry.  The rest of them at Grandfathers are pretty well now-  Grandfather has had a cold but is better-  Aunt Martha Leeds I suppose you have heard is at the Frankford Asylum, and from last accounts was not much better in her mind and was also very sick with [---] in her head-  I dont know whether thee has heard or not that the new building at Haverford is to go up next year they having got enough subscribed to warrant them in commencing so Samuel Alsop Jr told me.
   
   Lillies letter from [---] arrived on sixth day last and we were very glad to hear of your being so comfortably and pleasantly fixed-  Please give a great deal of love to both Lilly and Alexis and tell them I often think of them both with much affection and truly it does seem a long long time since we parted with them.  I do hope the stay will do you all a great deal of good-  I am afraid you have missed some of our letters Chell and I both misunderstood and have been directing our letters to Brown-Shipley & Co Liverpool - and I am afraid they have not forwarded them-  I wrote not long ago a letter to thee and one to Lilly and Alexis enclosing a photograph of the baby to each-  If they have never come to hand I will send you another-  Harry has at last made up his mind to return to Minneapolis - he expects to start next fourth day.  I hope he will have a more prosperous time the coming year than he has had the last-  Upon looking over the forepart of this letter which I wrote a week ago I find I have mentioned about the building at Haverford in that so thee will please excuse my telling it again-  I dont feel like rewriting the letter-  Chell sends her love to you all in which I join and wish you "a merry Christmas" and "a happy New Year"-  I remain thy
   loving brother

   Thy postal came today and was very welcome.  I was very glad to hear of your welfare.  We are all well at home.  Carry has been spending several days at Ellis Yarnalls but expected to come home this morning -  Father Tom and C were at Cousin F Yarnalls reception yesterday -  There were 500 [invitations?] and they had a band of music and four large omnibusses running to and from the station.  Father seemed quite disgusted-  Tom seems quite well again-  Carrie and Anna Rhoads will not come on until the 25th [---] proposed and either Tom or father will come on with them.  Aunt E Cope has gone down to Maryland to spend a month -  This morning was Monthly Meeting at Frankford.  Father and I drove over in the buggy with Dick -  and I came on into town-  Sister Ellie is going down to Maryland on second day next.  The weather is quite warm again today-  Lilie & Alexis moved last third day and are quite getting settled in -  I have not been over there yet but hope to go in a day or so -  I think thee had better buy a sythe I told John I want the tall grass in the Chicken yard and the weeds between the barn and Carriage house mowed-  Hope you are getting along comfortably and are all well-  Love to all and lots for thy ever dear self-  Dont work too hard-  Try and rest

   My dear wife
   
   I mailed a letter to thee this morning and now I am going to add-  Mother and Aunt Mary are uncertain as to whether they will come on on the 6th or the 9th.  I dont see quite how we are going to manage matters as to room.  I suppose Anna Rhoads will or can return with me.  My plan is to come on on 6th day and stay until the following 2nd or 3rd day night.  Anna Hartshorne I believe is to go to New Bedford on the 10th or 11th or thereabouts so there will be room after that date but [---] for a few days I do not see quite how thee will manage-  Aunt M E H talks of staying 10 days and talks about [the?] family sponging on us too much &c &c-  Now I wish thee would write to her and tell her we expect a longer time than that and also ask Uncle Henry to come on.  I do not think he expects to come on at all or perhaps only to bring Aunt Mary back and I think thee had better ask him as it will have much more effect than my doing so.  I do not know anything about the movements of our guests but suppose Tom is going to leave this evening-  I thought I had better send thee these details that thee might know what to do and how to plan things-Now I must again say farewell dearest.
   With much love I am thy

Philadelphia, 7 mo. 12 1883
   
   My Darling wife, I stayed out to meeting this morning and on my arrival at this office at noon found thy telegram and Algie's letter awaiting me. Dear little boy I am very glad to hear he is better and it was very thoughtful and kind of thee dearest to telegraph. We are going along very nicely at home. Tom and Alf and I had dinner at 7 o'clock last night and it was very nice. We had fricasseed chicken, potato peas and [beets?] and then raspberries for dessert and tea was on the side board and we each took a cup at the close of the meal. We then adjourned to the piazza at about 8:15. 
   
   [We?] weather is very pleasant the thermo. at my side as I write marking 86° at this hour 3 PM. I was very much surprised to hear of the death of Hannah Newhall. She is to be burried to morrow at 2 o'clock from our house.  I was tired last evening and so did not go over to call until this morning I found Abby and Mary in a very resigned? and very cheerful state. They said they did not regret at all having moved out and were glad of it. They said they were afraid we would not like to have the funeral from our house and hoped there mothers death then would not cast a gloom over the house for us-  I assure them that it would not in the least and that I was very glad they were going to have the funeral from there-  Abby said the great heat of last week seemed to prostrate their mother and she gradually sank away until third day morning she quietly ceased to breathe without struggle-  Ally said she was leaning over her at the time doing something and her bother had her hand closed upon a handkerchief and she said she noticed her hand gently relaxed and ther handkerchief dropped this was all that markedthe change.  William Newhall was there and he told me he was so glad his sisters had such a place to stay in and Abby and Mary both seems so glad they were when they were and not at a boarding house or hotel.  They said it had seemed like home to them from the very first day they move out.  I sent them some flowers on my way to meeting.  They want me to be on hand at the time of the funeral to do some things for them so I shall go out in the 12 M train.
   
   We had a good meeting this morning Cousin James and Samuel Morris spoke-  Cousin James came to me after meeting and said they were so much obliged for our kindness to Anna &c-  I am better dearest the pain in my back is almost entirely gone and my [---] is less.  Tell Mother we concluded it would be more polite for me to call on Lena so I drove over there before meeting and invited her to come over and stay sixth day night with us and she accepted-  Nancy left last evening going into town at 7 o clock.  Everything is moving along very serenely so far as I know.  It is fun to see Tommy studying [---] and Paramous book at the breakfast table getting up a menu winding up by saying "Well!  I hate this business"  My dearest my thoughts are with you a great great deal and I do hope thee will take care of thyself and that you all may be better.

   My very dear wife.
   Thine written on first day and finished on 2nd day morning at hand thanks therefor.  I am quite well again only a little cold hanging around manifesting itself by a little huskiness in my voice nothing to speak of and I should not do so now only I promised to write fully.  I will forward thy letter to Mary F Brown as soon as I learn the address.  Yesterday I attended the funeral.  I went out home at 1:15 and we had dinner at 2 oclock and I drove father over.  he went to Cousin F Yarnalls to tea and I drove home-  Hazen drove over to Cousin F's and brought father home-  They funeral was very large- but I did not see one of Susie's relatives there but myself-  The services were conducted by Reverend Watson assisted by Dr Coil and F Yarnall and one or two other ministers were in attendance-  There was no sermon-  The hymn sung was "Asleep in Jesus"-  After the funeral I spoke to Cousin Elizabeth and Wistar and sent a message of love and sympathy to Susie-  As you may not have heard the details of the death I will tell you as we have learned them.  The cause of death was a blood clot upon the brain.  the Dr also found one on the lungs-  They (Chas [Wheeler?] and Charlie) were rather late for the train and were running to catch it just as they got to the Washington Markets Charlie who was a little ahead of his father looked back to see where he was and saw him stagger and then fall he was unconscious and was carried into the Market house-  A doctor was immediately sent for but Chas Wheeler died just as the Dr arrived.  he lived about 15 minutes after he fell.  The body was then carried to the Station House little Charlie going with it.  He had to remain with it until 7 oclock in the evening and attend the inquest and undergo an examination answering many what would seem to us knowing the circumstances [---]questions such as whether his father was drunk and whether he was a drinking man &c &c-  What a terrible ordeal for a boy 14 years old.  At the funeral yesterday he looked very badly like an old man.  Susie arrived about 7 oclock in New York and Charlie then joined her and they came on- when they arrived at Bryn Mawr through some mistake they were not met and Susie and the four Children had to walk home about a mile and a half at between 11 and 12 oclock at night.
   
   I believe Susie expects to return today to Newport.
   
   I am rejoiced dear to hear of your welfare.  The weather yesterday was very oppressive-  It was the most trying day we have had this summer.  Today is warm the thermometer standing at about 85 at a little after 10 ock yet the air is not so steamy- and by the paper I see there is a prospect of cooler weather-
   
   Please give my love to mother and I am sorry to hear she is not well hope nothing much amiss.  Give my love to the children and with a heartful for thy own dear self I am thy loving
   husband

My dear   friend:
As I did not gather from thy message when I last   called at Aubrey that thou wouldst have declined seeing me   if not unusually occupied, and as I deem it one of the first   duties of social life, if not the very first, to seek so to   supply one another (to honour a figure from astronomy.) with   the elements of our several orbits, that we may always know   as exactly as may be, where to find one another; and as a   stubborn lameness, some still more urgent engagement, and   the recent icy walking has combined to prevent my again   calling as I have ever since desired; under these   circumstances I feel at liberty to send thee another brief   letter. Had I succeeded in seeing thee at that last call, I   should perhaps have had little to say but 
I had not presumed on tasking thee with any perusal or   examination of this MS. I left for H.W.S., and that there   was a method--something I trusted of the gospel "decently   and in order", even in the seeming caprice of my movement. I   could not but be conscious of my own appearance of   insensibility; but I may humbly and thankfully assert that I   was and am at least sensible of having a fixed object in   living, which reaches even to the relationship of such   comparative strangers as thou and I must as yet confess   ourselves to be, and which is even necessary, (coupled with   confessed infirmity) to account for some show of   vacillation, or spasmodic irregularity. For instance, I hope   not to leave the world without doing something to the   formation and definite recognition of an "inner circle of   friendship" in which superlative epithets, such as "dearest"   &c. will not be regarded as necessarily exclusive, and into   which a subtle form of witchcraft whichI must not here particularize (for the Bible, as the   Westminster Review justly claims, "must stand or fall with   the doctrine of Witchcraft") shall not be able to enter. And   how difficult must the steadfast upholding of such a   doctrine be in a community whose Social Code, and whose very   theory of the family, commit it to the assumption that   universal tithe shall be the weakest rather than the   strongest! 
I am not now sure but that like one of old I   shall have to appeal from ecclesiastical indifference or   opposition, to the "Cesar" of public sentiment. A recent   Essay on "Stages of Faith", tracing the course of   consciousness from the experience of physical or outward   immunity (i.e. the Salvation which is common to "all men". 1   Tim.  iv,10) to that of spiritual power and causation, and   recognizing the intellectual element as both the social and   the mediatoreal phase of Christianity, and Lo, through the   continued presence of our Lord with his followers "to the   end of the world", the ground and surety of an uninterrupted   progress to that dread but glorious consummation,--in short   recognizing that element as being the witnessing of "the   water" (1 Jno. v.8);--such an Essay, I say, has been offered   by me to each of the weekly Philadelphia Journals claiming   to represent Quakerism, and declined by at least two of   them. Even if the other two shall do likewise I mean to look   for the sympathy of some of our fellow professors in   publishing it, and would like to include some of the Cope   family, if I have not already overdosed them with my   manuscripts and my manners. I must not, I suppose, ask thee   to write me, even on their behalf. If thou would only call   to see my sister M., I think I might regard it as a token   for good. I feel sure she could not have a more acceptable   visitor--at any rate not beyond her nearest kindred--Please   give my love to thine with thee, and believe me, very   sincerely, though too untruly (some hair-splitting or   nail-splitting is needed there) thy friend, Richd   Randolph

Dear Mother & sisters,
I think I shall            take to writing to you in a journal form, as I often have            little times when I can sit down for a few minutes & no            longer.  I recd thy letter Carry of the 9th wh. was very            nice & also the cuffs, wh. were also very nice, & I am very            much obliged to whoever did ‘em & that person was mother I            reckon & it was very good of her & they were just what I            wanted. & now if you can only send me a white skirt, I shall            be so [g---] for I can hardly get along without, as I find            the one I brot will hardly bear another washing.
On 4th            day eve. I took tea at Mart. Chestons & had such a nice            time.  Altho’ she is so feeble that she washardly able to sit up all the even, she insisted upon      inviting a few others to make it pleasant for me – & I thot      it was so kind in her. The party consisted of H Lytle (who      is such a nice & good person) Julia Valentine Dr Thomas H.      King & Jesse – & we had such a nice home-like time, & such      an elegant tea & Ice cream & all.  I thought it the nicest      visit I have paid, & then in the evening as it was rainy she      wd. insist upon sending us home in the carriage & she asked      me so kindly to come there any time when I felt like it,      that I felt quite gratified.  It rained so much the      afternoon I was to go out to Careys – that it was deferred      so I have not been yet, & I believe I have’nt done anything      in particular else, since [---] wrote last.  While I think      of it Caroline Ill ans. thy questions. There are 200 chil’n      in our sch. & 4 teachers wh. makes 1 to every 50.  Mine is      the least advanced class & consequently the least      interesting.  Ages, frm. abt, 7 yrs. to 15 or 16. & strange      to say the smallest chil’n in my sch are generally the best      scholars. The greater proportion are boys, about a third      girls. They are children of this place who have not hitherto      had the advantage of free schools.
End of first sitting.3rd day – 18th
I have laid aside my letter for two or      three days, – for we have all felt so sad since hearing the      dreadful news that I cld. not feel like writing abt.      ordinary things & there seemed little to say on the one      great subject – the presidents dreadful death, wh. seemed      dreadful enough to strike every one dumb with horror &      astonishment.  It seemed so near to us, & the more so      because the very day after wh. it occurred we had planned to      make a little excursion to Washington for the day having      been invited by one of Miss M’s frds. who often goes down.       So you can judge of our horror when a few min. before      setting out, this dreadful intelligence was brot. to us. The      feeling here against the seccessionists has been intense as      they have been heard to rejoice in the sts. at thedreadful news, & to have prophesied a few days since that   our rejoicings wld. be turned to sorrow.  The city was under   martial law for a day or two – but by the strict vigilance   of the authorities was kept quiet.  but they compelled every   secessionist as well as union on the principal business sts   to drape their stores in mourning & [if] the appearance it   presents is very solemn & sad.  I suppose it is the same in   Phila. – & everywhere.  It seems really a more horrible   thing than some we have shrunk frm. reading in books of   history.  People here seem to be sanguine about the new   administration – & the prospects of peace, but that does not   take away frm. the horrible fact that there can exist in our   midst such a wicked & fiendish spirit.
4th day morn — our   school has been dismissed to day on account of the   solemnities wh. are to be observed in the churches &   elsewhere
We also had a holliday on 2nd day & Jesse Tyson   very kindly took advantage of it to take us a very beautiful   ride to a lake abt. 7 miles frm. here wh. is situated among   hills & woods as beautiful as any Iever saw.  I had no idea there was anything of the kind so   near to the city.  It was delightful to get a sight of the   beautiful spring in the country.  The trees are just putting   out their first leaves, & look so lovely, & we cld. not but   enjoy it in spite of the mournful circumstances wh. have   been so much in our minds,  Jesse took us past his place,   where he wishes to erect his model house.  It is a very   beautiful situation indeed with views of the city & the bay   &c.
I suppose you (that is some of you) are in the midst   of yearly meeting now. but the sad newsmust have thrown a great damp over every thing.
We have   been spending two or three afternoons this week at the   meeting house sewing for the refugees.  The friends have a   sewing machine there, & meet every day this week to sew.  &   they will get a good deal accomplished no doubt.  Julia   Valentine seems to be very active & is a very nice frd.  I   [am] [you] [will] try to call on [Tamy] Miller when she is   in P again as she — Aunt has been so kind in asking me to   come out there &c.
Clementine Cope.
If you can find   out when [Tamy] will be in P I have no doubt she wld. bring   any package.  I want to go out this morning to get one or   two thins so I will bring my letter to a close.  Hope I   shall get one frm. you today but suppose you have felt   unlike writing as I have.  But for this, I shd. have written   to Tom this week, tell him.  Give my love to Cous. T. & all   enquiring frds. am glad to hear you miss me a little some   times.  Yours affec Clemmy
I miss you very much

Dear father
I rec’d   thy letter 5th day morning.  Thy accounts quite make me wish   to see England some time although I dont know that that time   will ever come.  On 4th day we sailed round Canonicut, and   since Lilly says she has given thee a condensed account of   our trip, I will copy our log by way of variety.  The   officers were: Capt. Geo. F Merritt, 1st mate T.P. Cope Jr   2nd mate A Cope Jr; Seaman T.K. Longstreth, Cabin boy F.H.   Cope.  Steward M. C Collins.  Cook V. Hartshorne and 6   passengers, A Newhall, M Newhall, M Farnum, H Carter, M.   Collins, & E.S. Cope.
Log of the Canonicut Party – Yacht   “TCope [Deferred]”
(Rations limited)
Started from the   pier at 8 1/2, A.M., arrived at the lighthouse at 8.40.   there met M.C. Cope and party in a row boat, who wished us   joy,and desired us to report all new discoveries; soon after we   commenced telling fortunes.  2 m. of 9 o’clock saw a   porpoise on the starboard side.  9.22. off fort Adams,   weather, calm, thin canopy of clouds, at this moment it was   proposed to “put more steam on.”  Three persons forward of   the “Lobster Box.”  progress, “slow but awfully sure.”  10.   o’clock, interesting information concerning the compass, by   Capt. Merritt.  surf seen at Bever Tail, fears entertained   for the health of the party.  Some excitement caused by the   appearance of two fish, which produced restlessness on the   part of the cabin boy –  10.11. opposite the Dumplings.  11   o’clock opposite Castle Hill the game of quintettes played   with interest by the 1st mate, cook, and several of the   passengers; the steward seiged with headache – at this time   doubts were expressed by the captain as to the probability   of the winds changing before 6 P.M. weather still calm.  [8]   m after 11. met a sailing vessel commanded by captain Henry   Merritt, rowed by the capt. and sculled by Henry Merritt jr   who hailed us, and threw a small lobster into the boat one   of the passengers was badly bitten which caused great   excitement untill she was rescued from the jaws of the   carnivorous creature.  11 1/2 A.M. Slight windthe South and visible, stood off to welcome it.  Party   regaled themselves with rations. 12. M. South wind   continues.  candy handed.  Met a schooner and were saluted   by a dog on board.  Long swells, health good.  12.10.   conversation on the weather prohibited– a number of the   passengers retired to rest – Cabin boy reclining on a   passenger–  cook on the dinner basket–  1st mate absorbed in   a book.  12.45. Point Judith lighthouse in sight.  After   serious consideration it was decided to pursue our journey   on which account three cheers were given.  12.50. Passing   Bever Tail.  three more cheers – passengers happy – saluted   by the horn and a towel was waved to us, which compliment   was returned passengers waving handkerchiefs.  2. P.M.   Dinner – great dispute on the subject of ringing the   triangle.  2.45. from “Lobster Box” end–  dinner   accomplished satisfactorily leaving the voyagers in a   quiescent state of mind–  dinner consisted of 9 courses   closed with sour-drops–  opposite M. Williams’- Bay   comparatively speaking very rough!  Fast passing Wickford –   Slight excitement Fortunes being told again aft. The 1st   mate has just restored the cabin to order, after dinner.    Aft becoming very impudent.  Bow hair dressing.  1st matesweeping and thereby discomboberating all – 2.55. Patience   in sight.  sentiment in the bow, 3.12. Approaching the end   of Canonicut Greenwich off the larboard bow.  Patience and   Rocky Pt. ahead.  the breeze delightful, and all of the   party very comfortable, some reading, some working zephyr   work.  3.20. Rounding the north end of Canonicut.  Three   cheers given by all the party.  3.35. P.M. Rounding   Canonicut.  Newport in view – on our homeward trip – breeze   good.  some of the party wishing to land we are going to (we   did’nt) 3.38. Met the Providence steamboat- Needless anxiety   on the part of the passengers.  Now dashing gaily towards   Newport.  3.55 Proceeding fondly – just played games of   authors and consequences.  3 m. of 5.P.M. off the   Lighthouse. health good.  Fine breeze- Band tuning up for a   song before we reach the pier.  Arrived at the pier at   5.P.M.  On first day evening we took a walk to Tammany Hill.   we started after a 6 o’clock tea but were not able to get   there untill dark or dusk.  It is the first time I was ever   there.  We saw the lights at Point Judith, the Light Ship,   Bever Tail and the Break water.  Yesterday was splendidlyclear.  In the morning we took a short float, I cant call it   a sail there wasn’t any wind, after which we went bathing.    In the afternoon I made up a small sailing party consisting   of Alice Carter, Abby Newhall, Tom Longstreth and Alfred, we   went out to the Dumplings and landed, & afterwards came back   to take Caroline Mary her first sail.  She could’nt have had   a more pleasant evening it neither too cold nor too warm, &   there was a splendid breeze.  We went around Rose Island and   got back in good season.  though not strictly obeying her   mothers instructions about being home at half past 6.  This   morning we went bathing as usual and also engaged the boat,   Alfred preferring to go to Coddingtons Cove to bathing.    Thee will observe that I’ve been getting about as much good   out of boating as possible this season.  Since we arrived   Alf has become a staunch friend of Geo. Merritt’s and Hazen   of Geo. Barlow’s. Its quite remarkable how devoted Alf is,   he spends the big parts of his time at the reading room with   George.  This morning I got a new key fitted, formy valise, having lost the other since my arrival.  We were   not able to mail these letters in time to go by the [La---]   so they will have to take their chance by going via New   York.  There are 24 folks going to Philadelphia the night we   go, which will make a pretty effectual change in Mary   Williams’ boarders, and there will be no one left but Tom   Longstreth to do the honors of the occasion.  We are rather   puzzled as to what to do if we were left by the 7 o’clock   train from New York, since the 10 o’clock train has been   taken off the line.  We will have to run the risk, I   suppose, of getting the 8.40, Washington train, stopped at   Frankford.  Having run out of news and since mother is also   writing I will stop.
affecty thy son

I expect this   will be the last letter I shall write to thee this session   as the time is drawing near when we shall go home.  we are   now reviewing and it is not so hard as I expected it would   be  we have to be very industrious [about] our studies as   some of them are very hard particularly the history and I am   very much afraid I shall fail in that at examination as the   greater part of it I have not learned for I have not been in   that class, all the session.  Thomas Kite’s wife is here   spending a day or two and her daughter also.  I suppose thee   has heard of the little boy who has been so ill here he was   taken with the measles and that layed the foundation for the   consumption and after suffering for a long time he was taken   away at three o clock in the morning of the first of spring    we had no school on six or seventh day but we all went to   our school rooms and red our bibles and on seventh day   morning we were taken into see his corpse and he was buried on seventh day afternoon   his name was Nathan Comstock and he was an orphan he lived   in Lockport New York  he has a brother and sister here and   his sister is a lovely girl but I know very little about his   brother.  Benjamin Sharpless was here to thee funeral and he   asked me if I had ever seen him at Tommy Cope’s and I told   him no., but I have often heard of him.  I am looking for   uncle Samuel to come and see me as he has been away so long   and I think he might come to see me this session
Aunt   Lydia is not at all well she has a very bad cold and a good   deal of pain in that lump on her face and she keep her bed   the greater part of the day but she is rathe better at   present than she has been lately  I think she would of been   better if she had not of gone down to supper last night   through the cold entry.  I have some things to write for and   I do not think I shall have any more time to write to thee.

7th mo. 28th. 1867.

Dear Father
Lilly and Chelly having been keeping up such an active correspondence by the last two steamers, I thought I would reserve my efforts untill they had got through. 
We received a letter from uncle Tom inclosing a letter from thee informing us of the loss of thy masticators, it      would have been remarkably unfortunate if thee had not had      an extra set with thee.  I hope by this time thee is      enjoying thyself on terra firma, but since the difference of      time between where thee is and where we are is so great, we      find it hard to guess what thee is about.  We received letters from home last night, dated the 25th., saying they   were all well and preparing to leave for Newport on 5th day.   Mother had also received a letter from thee mailed at   Halifax
On last 6th day we rode to Stony Clove, an   entirely new place to me, about 10 miles distant.  The road   is quite rough, and runs between two mountains, one of which   rises almost perpendicularly about 1000 ft, as near as we   could judge, and on each side there are large rocks under   which we found ice: they say the sun never gets there and   the ice under the rocks never melts during the summer.  On   approaching this place the air becomes perceptably cooler   and on leaving it becomes warm again.  We took dinner at a   little farm house and although it was plain weenjoyed it very much.  After dinner we had to leave right   away for home.  Going back we had a splendid view of those   distant mountains you see on your way to the Plauterkill   Clove.
Yesterday morning we, that is Tom Stokes, Harry,   some other gentlemen and myself, walked down to Bastion   Falls to take a bath, thee remembers what a fine basin there   is at the foot of the falls, well it was there we went in;   the water was pretty cool on first going in but after we had   been in a little while, and had kicked around a good bit we   got quite warm and all in a glow.  We went under the fall   where it hit the rocks for a second time, but even there the   water stung like hail-stones, and I preferredthe pool to getting such a warming as that.  In the      afternoon we walked over to the Mountain House to see the      view, on starting it was beautifully clear but when we had      gone about half way, two clouds, very considerately, came      rolling down upon us, one from North and one from South      mountain, and by the time we got to the precipice both the      view and ourselves were completely mistified; we accordingly      went into the House and got weighed, and since thee will not      object to hearing how much some of the members of thy      immediate family weigh, I will give thee part of the      table:
R.R.C.  125 lbs.   E.S.C.  98 lbs.   T.P.C.  90      lbs.     Rachel has gained 7 lbs. since last sum- mer, and its becoming quite dreadful; I'm afraid, if she      goes on gaining, we will be obliged to have her put up in a      barrel and roll her home from Newport.  Tom Stokes, Ellie,      Madjie, and Walter are going home tomorrow morning: the rest      of us expect to leave here fourth day and go to Albany, we      will stay there that night, and go to Boston the next day;      leaving Boston 6th. day afternoon we will arrive at Newport      in time for tea.  I suppose mother has told thee that she      succeeded in engaging both the Georges during our stay      there.  The weather here has been very warm and showery; to      day it is very pleasant but it has been so very showery we      were afraid to try going to walk. Aunt Lizzie received two letters from the Adirondacks to      day one from cousin Clemmy and one from aunt Annie, giving      an account of a trip which they had taken to lake Placid by      the way of John Brown's grave; aunt Annie said the grave was      very plain, there was a tombstone with some engraving on it      and on a boulder nearby was the plain inscription "John      Brown - 1859."  She also said cousin Clemmy was a good deal      stronger and was able to bear fatigue as well as the rest of      them  They were both very much surprised to hear of thy      sudden leaving for England.  Lilly and Chelly send their      love.  We are all well and have had a most splendid time      considering that our "pa" is on the other side of the Atlantic and now having given thee   all the news I can remember I will   stop.
affectionately
thy son Thos P. Cope Jr

Dear Alg,

I   meant or wanted to write to thee sooner, but thought I would   wait until we were really touching Palestine. I have my map   at hand in the case which thee presented me, and I think it   is going to be fine. So far nothing is blocking our plans –   neithercholera nor fanaticism aroused by war – and we are due at   Beirut tomorrow to go on to Damascus and take a two or three   weeks’ trip across country to Hermon, Galilee, and Samaria,   and so down to Jerusalem. To-day we have been looking, from   our ship, up at nothing less than Mount Carmel. Haifa as   thee knows is built at its foot and is of course very   picturesque. Part of the mountain’s sides is bare and brown,   rather, but part is covered with small trees, carob and oak,   I believe, which isa very pretty sight. Six or seven miles up the coast we can   see Acre with all its crusading associations. And as we have   been thinking of some of the associations of Mount Carmel it   is of course intensely interesting. I have a fine pair of   number eight binoculars which add to our enjoyment   greatly.

Nat Groton and I get along very well. He is   very patient with me; my awkwardness and unnecessary anxiety   in giving fees must be a great source of trial tohim, but he bears it well. With all these fellows coming   after you and towards you and around you for “bakshish” all   the time, it is very trying sometimes. Yesterday I had my   first – and I hope my last, as it is not pleasant –   experience of being cursed up and down and out and out by   one of the fellows who brought us out again to the Steamer   from Jaffa, for giving too little bakshish.

We went   ashore forpart of the day yesterday at Jaffa, or Joppa, which was   our first contact with Palestine. It was not calculated to   be sentimental. The disembarking is not easy, for there is   no harbor, and the rowboats are hard to get into from the   steamer. As I stepped down, the boat happened to sink in the   trough of a wave and I had the queer feeling of stepping   down into space.We were rowed in in a pelting rain, too, which made the   little streets of Joppa literally inches deep with – not   mud, but filth. The old tomb of Tabitha was only discovered   recently, but is old. The “house of Simon the tanner” may   well have been in a different place from the one which is   shown you. But after you think it over, these things make no   difference. It is Joppa. And the tanner’s house was just the   sort of one which is shown, and hisbusiness was a tannery, I suppose to make leather bottles   for water and wine. His house no doubt opened out on unclean   courts, and he was contaminated in Jewish eyes by touching   dead animals, swine at that. So where was a better place   than such a little house, with its unclean factory in the   midst and its flat roof looking out to sea and its host none   the less hospitable for any of these things, for Peter to be   prepared for his wonderful vision? And in this needy, little   town Tabitha did live. And thesame intensely interesting, picturesque life goes on its   crooked, little streets and alleys to-day. We saw a man   sitting, grinding meal between an upper and a lower   mill-stone, small ones, the upper of which he turned by   hand. We squeezed by long strings of camels, and walked   through swarms of turbaned Arabs. There are lots of other   interesting things in Joppa which stay with you in spite of   the filth through which  you wade, and the variegated odors   which assail your nostrils, but I must stop now. Please give   my love to thy mother, and Anna, and Harold, and my kind   remembrances to Miss Richardson, and if I may still trouble   thee, much love to Jac and Ed, and thyself

from Joe.

Dear Net,
I have just got thy   letter of the 1st to the 19th inclusive, (where has it been   so long?)  Its very well I did’nt go on with the great scold   I began yesterday — I thot, I wld defer it one day longer &   see – Why I dont believe you know how long you’ve been   neglecting me, & thee must remember while thee’s   journalizing that thy writing every day is’nt my getting   it,.  However it was very interesting if not very late news.   Thee does’nt say a word about having got either of my last   letters,  I hope the one containing my elaborate sketch of   the Environs of the city & my room as a centre, did not get   lost, as it wld. have been a waste of artistic   effort.
The presidents death has indeed made mourning in   our land.  The ways of Providence are very inscrutable.  I   told you in my last letter of the feeling produced here, so   I will notrevert to it..  The day of the funeral procession here was   very solemn.  We dismissed our school, & went by particular   invitation to where we cld. have an excellent view of the   whole as it passed, at the store of an old gentleman in   market st, where we had a room to ourselves & refreshments   provided wh. seemed rather singular but is his custom.  It   was the most touching & mournful procession I ever saw    Perhaps you saw it in Phila.  It will take a long time to   forget the grief & horror of this sad event,– but work has   to be done & yesterday our sch. began [afresh] after the   interruptions of the week before, & while sch. lasts we are   forced to forget every thing but the work before us.  It is   what you might call intense work. & wld. be wearing [--]   [----] [----] if incessant.  Thy description of getting   home, & the nice clean room & all most made me home-sick.  I   miss great many of the little home luxuries and cleannesses   here,– but cannot expect to have them in boarding.  We dont   get any good Mrs [Mcaff--] [----] [butter] &c — excepting   when we get invited out to our rich frds.
I was perfectly   charmed with my visit at Carey’s last 6th day night.  Their   place is perfectly magnificent & the house keeping   altogether princely compared to this.  I went out in the   afternoon & returned next morning.  Their house situated on   the tip top of a [very] hill seems like something up in the   air, & the view splendidSusan Carey has gone to Phil. & expects to return next 7 or   2 day.  She very kindly offered to bring anything for me —   said she wld. have room for any sized bundle, so that I   might get my silk skt.  But it is so late in the season that   I think I can do without it, & I shd. not like to ask her to   bring so large a thing.  I wld. like tho’ to have my old   blk. silk body & I wish thee wld send me a little brown   grenadine bag of horse hair in the right hand corner of my   upper beaureau drawer.  These things however are not very   important, & you need not send them if inconvenient.+    [+Perhaps you can send them by T Miller instead.]  S Carey   stays at Anthony Kimbers cor. 13. & Arch.  I yesterday recd   the skt. sent by Alford Coale for wh. I am much obliged.    Mary Pennyman called yesterday & was very pleasantLizzie Hopkins of the house where Lizzie Edge, Jenny Harris   &c staid, called to see me also, & some Matthews wh. lives   in the country said Lizzie E had written to her that I was   here & that she intended to invite me out to her place in   the country, a very pleasant one I understand.  A gentleman   called here night before last — Miller M Kim whom you have   perhaps heard of — one of the Freedmens board in Phila. &   [----] me a message frm. Cous. Frank whom he had seen the   day before.  Tho’ a stranger he seemed quite like somebody   from home.  To night I am going with H Lytle to the frds.   bible class, meeting at Dr. Thomas’ — it is attended by   frds. mostly, altho’ Ellen Carey who is an episcopalean &   one or two others attend.  They say it is very interesting,   tho’ I have’nt been before.  A few days ago I went to hear   Thomas Beecher a (brother of H Wards) speak, but was   disappointed, as it was nothing very interesting.     I cld.   not make out by thy journal exactly when your visit to Aunt   C’s began or ended, but am glad you had a nice time.  Give   my love to them & tell them I hope they’ll ans. my note.    Love also to Cous. F & M.  You were quite enterprising to   walk up to Athensville.  I am going to try & write to Tom

1st day eve

My dear   Mother

I had to leave off writing very suddenly last   time, as thee must have seen by the letter having no   direction.  We got to writing in bed at West Point as we   woke up early, & were not going to take breakfast till 8   1/2; but we had to go at 9 1/2, & as we were very pokey we   did not get down to breakfast till 9 o’clock-hence my great   hurry.  We left West P. in the boat, the rest of the way up   the Hudson was not however nearly so interesting, we soon   got out of the Highlands & then it seemed very tame.  This   is the most magnificent place we were ever, or are likely   ever, to be in; The view from the front of the house is very   extencive & beautifulfrom one place we can see the top of Mount Washington with   the opera glass.  The house is quite a large one tho’ mostly   old fashioned except the parlor wh. is up stairs, & has I   think most probably been altered the passages are the most   intricate I ever was in, & sometimes I feel completely lost.   We are on the very top of the mountain with dreadful   prespicise’s all around us, & it is the most dreadful place   to get up to that ever was, thee knows its a twelve miles   drive up the mountain from the landing, & how long does thee   ’spose we were getting up? 5 1/2 hours- just think of it the   horses walked nearly all the way, & stoped ever few   minut[e]s to rest; after we got fairly to the foot of the   mountain within about three miles from the house father &   Tom got out to walk, “& the consequence was” they got here   an hour & a quarter before us.the last part of the way poor Rach, was dreadfully sick, the   boat & stage together were too much for her, & as soon as we   got there I helped her get right to bed, she slept pretty   well however after she once did get to sleep tho’ she   suffered dreadfully poor child, thee knows her headaches are   so hard to bear, but don’t worry she’s quite well to day.    This morning they had service in the parlor to wh. Cous.   Clem, Chell & I went with papa’s leave. the sermon was   pretty good & I must confess I think it much better that   poking round all 1st day & going no where, if you can’t go   to meeting go to church – “thems my sentiments.”  After   service we all went out to take a ramble & after a good deal   of hunting round for paths & scrambling up them when found,   we at last arrivedat the top of South Mountain It was a beautiful walk   although it seemed to scare poor aunt Annie terribly to see   us so near the edge of these awful prespicise’s wh. surround   us every where; the rocks covered with ferns, mosses,   litgens are really beautiful.  We passed through what they   call “[Pudding]–stone Hall” a large cleft in the rocks   formed of pudding–stone & also through the lemon-squeezers   another crevise.  We are altogether enjoying ourselves very   much I think & propose staying here till 3rd day afternoon   when we will probably leave for Saratog[a], & thence to Lake   George.  at least those are present prospects but as we have   changed our plans several times to day I wont say certainly,   if we p[u]rsue the plan now proposed wewill stop at Belloes Falls on our way to Boston & spend   next 1st day at Nahant if we can.  We have rather a funny   time altogether about our meals & sleeping apartments here   things are not extremely clean, & it is so crowded we have   to come to the second table & therefore have to take our   breakfast at ten & dinner at four & now about 6 the supper   bell has rung, but I ‘spose we’ll come second class there   to.  We are quite glad of our thick dresses Mother, & have   worn nothing else hardly since we left home.  its right cold   to night, & we have to wear shawls & things all the time to   keep warm.  It is getting almost to dark for me towrite any more dear Mother so I think the[e] must let me   close.  I hope we shall hear from home tomorrow we want to   hear very much how you all are.  I shall try to write soon   again if we get to a stopping place  we have been going so   steadily that there has been hardly any time to do any   thing, but see the sights  Please excuse all defects – &   with love to all I am
ever thy loving
daughter Lily

Dear Uncles
Thomas & Joshua Pim   /

I wrote to my Bror. John &c the 17th. of last mo:   aqt.ing them of a great alteration in my ffamily, wch.   letter I supose went in a ship just then ready to sail to   Ireland and now I acquaint you that it hath pleased Divine   Providence to remove my wife from me by Death,  She was   taken Ill of (that Dreadfull distemper) the smallpox about   the 4th. of last moth: & departed in the night between the   14th. & 15th. of ye. same being Sorely afflicted wth. the   distemper, but verry sencible all the time & I hope made   good use of sd. time, often praying & praising God, & tho:   in the time of her health she did not seem as fully as I   cou’d a wisht to Joyn wth. ffrds.  (tho she- went to no   other worship that I know off since we came here but   severall times to ffriends meetings) yet in her Illness she   was desirous of the company of sollid ffrds & severall of   such did visit her & I think are generally in good hopes   that she Dyed in Peace & I believe few who knew her here   were streangers to her former circumstance for my part I did   not endeavour to conceall the truth from Honest ffriends,   and before I pesumed to appoint her buriall I requested   leave of ffriends to Bury her in their ground, which was soe   readily granted that they told me they thought it needless   to ask it, phaps you may desire to know wt. I recd of the   debt due to me I cannot say yt. I recd. none tho: (I thought   more was due,) for Just at last, she desired it might be   forgot or forgiven wch. I think implyed some acknowledgment    I think for above a year past she grew the most sollid &   sober yt. I have known her at all – & I cannot but admire   how much her loss is lamented in this neighbourhood, for she   was a verry oblieging neighbour & skillfull in many   things

I mentioned to my Bror. &c [---] [---] of the   Illness of my youngest Child, we thought it was dying the   next day after its mothers death, yet it continued for   fifteen days longer for the most pt. in great extremity &   then Died, wch. long Illness I believe helped to wean me   from it, soe that its Death did not affect me soe much as I   believe it wd. if it had a died soon, for it was a verry   pleasant Child, it was 7 months old when it fell   sick

I mentioned in a former letter to my Brother the   Death of my servant Jo: Gavin who was the first of my   ffamily who was taken Ill, & Died about a week or 6 days   before the next began my ffamily then consisted of 12 psons   (i:e: before this sickness) whereof 7 was to have it, & of   the 7: 3 is dead, wch. we may conclude was a great stroake,   tho: I may tell you that it does not yet seem soe hard for   me to bear as wt. I formerly bore, but the Death of my poor   wife seemd a greater exercise than I expected it wd. a been,   however I still endeavour to be patient & content wth. what   Providence permits to be my lot in this troublsom   world

I am through [meny] greatly favoured wth.   Health & my five Children are now pitty well tho: my Son   Thos. has had a hard time & a narrow escape with his life   thro: the smallpox

I have been verry well furnisht   with good neighbours during this trouble pticularly Thos.   M.cChuns wife (being a nurse) did not see her own house for   two weeks of the time of my poor Babes Illness,  I have this   comfort that my poor Children seems verry to’rdly, & my Dtr.   Sarah considering her age verry pitty as to her knowledge in   the way of Houskeeping, & on her and my maid Mary Turner.  I   think that pt. must pitty much depend at [pesant]

now   Dear Uncles I shall use some further freedom wth. you, this   Cheange in my ffamily ocasions many thoughts in my mind, one   whereof is to this purpose that since the cause of my   leaving you, my ffriends, & my native Country, is now   remov’d, why shou’d not I return there again, least I shou’d   be taken from my Children & they left more destitute a mong   streangers, but in answer to that, can I think that I should   be brought all the way to this remote pt. of the world for   no other end than to bury my wife, this Country I find more   agreeable to my Health (else it is wth. working harder) this   Country also is governed by more agreeable Laws than that   here are plenty of good ffriends (tho: not my near   Relations) who I believe wd. take care of my Children were I   taken from them, & phaps I may have opptunity to [---] be of   more servis here than there, & thu---] reasoni--] concerning   wch. I desire your sollid Consideration & answer as [---] as   PossibleHowever if you please to Inform me how the woolen trade is   now in Ireland & whether, I am freed from that holding wch.   I was liable to, I am as I mentioned to you before pitty   much Involvd. in Debt & do find it hard to pay Debts wth.   this way of living. corn being low & money scearce, but do   think my self now more at liberty than before to consider of   some other way of making my life Easier, but not by any   alteration soe suddenly as [y.] year

I desire a   pticular account of your [---] familys & my Cousin Wm.   Glaister & of our ffamily in Generall & of ffrds &   neighbours where any alteration has happen’d since my   leaving you,

Soe wth. Dear Love to you all I Conclude   your Loving nephew & affectionate ffriend

P:S: the Smallpox continues to spead over this   Country this being the 3d. time of its being here since   settled by the English, it mises but few ffamilyes, & takes   off many heads of familyes especially men in their prime,   here are many widdows now in this County  I am in   expectation of Ja: Nicholson in a little time [p] whom I   expect an act. from Irland & if he dont bring me a servant   or servants I shall be in great want for I am soe now, I   hired. an Indifferant hand lately at Husbandry & it Cost me   36s for 4 weeks (& diat) this has povd. a hard winter &   Spring [fother] is now verry scearce wth. many people but   mine holds out, tho: I lost one cow, yesterday & the night   before here fell a great Snow wch. seems streange to the   people,

Paris 3rd Month 14th 1840
My Dear Cousin
I suppose you   have through the medium of letters to some of our family   heard of us and our safe arrival in Europe, but in   compliance with thy request and my promise which has not   been forgotten, I thought (altho at a late period) a breif   sketch of our [pastimes] in our new location would be   acceptable hoping that you retain a feeling of interest in   our welfare.  We arrived in London after a short and   altogather pleasant voyage passed ten day’s there was   buisily engaged in visiting the many objects very   interesting to strangers, the Tower, Westminster Abbey, St   Paul’s, House of Lords, and various other places, We then   left; after a travel of four days thro an interesting   country we arrived at Paris, during which time we were all   favoured with health, and our children were very good   scarcely uttering a word of complaint of fatigue or any   thing else, this thee may well suppose enhanced our   pleasure, or at least diminished our difficulties, When we   arrived in Paris, we took posession of apartments engaged   for our reception in a French family who speak English,  the   family consists of this and five American families, who form   a pleasant domestic circle, they are all plainly disposed   people, some very interesting a Doctor Lowell with his wife   and daughter who have visited most of the countries of   Europe, Egypt, Palestine, are with us, English is spoken at   our table, this altho very pleasant retards our progress in   the acquisition of the french language,
We are situated   in Rue de Rivoli opposite theTuileries the garden annexed to the palace, the residence of   the royal family, our location is very pleasant, excepting   that we are in the fourth story of the house (this in   America would not be considered respectable) not so in Paris   the population is so great; that highly respectable and even   wealthy families occupy apartments, consisting of several   rooms on a level, so that a house (of course large) will   accommodate many families, a very small proportion of   residents occupying a house as we do in America, this I felt   to be a great abridgment of my domestic comfort
My   ignorance of the language and the uncertainty of our   continuance induces us to board, I do not wish to encumber   myself with domestic cares, for the management of a family   in Paris is attended by much care, for one who would not   choose to leave every thing to the regulation of servants,    There are several hundred Americans in Paris who form a   pleasant society, it is customary here for those who keep   house to set apart one evening in the week for the reception   of their freinds, who receive an invitation to visit them on   that evening whenever inclination dictates, this promotes   great sociability among those who meet, the simplicity of   the entertainment is to be admired, consisting generally of   a cup of tea and cake only, very seldom serving any other   refreshment, in other respects not so simple, as a great   regard is paid to personal appearance, Dress, Dress, seems   to engross their minds to the exclusion of other and better   considerations,
Our two daughters are at a school of high   repute and we think deservedly so, they are improving in   their studies,We have visited several churches, Catholic and protestant    This we feel to be a very great privation, to have no place   of worship to resort to in accordance with our own views   where we could commune with our own hearts and be still, but   we feel the necessity of recurring to the dictates of that   inward guide, which if obey’d will lead out of all error,    We have visited a great many of the places of interest to   strangers, there are many galleries of paintings very fine,   there is at this time an annual exhibition at the Louvre, of   new pieces, some private collections also
I have in my   silent musing’s in immagination revisited most of your   dwellings,  Dear Aunts Ruth and Margery very frequently   present themselves before me, when we left home they both   seemed feeble, I hope their lives may be prolonged to the   comfort of their children by whom they are surrounded, but   it seemed to me [that] the sun of their day was near   [setting] in a tranquil evening, if My Dear Cousin this   excites sufficient interest in thy breast to induce a reply,   information of them as well as many other members of our   family would be grateful to us who are situated so far from   many they still hold dear, please remember us affectionately   to them All,  Richard and Ruth, Caleb and Martha, Samuel   Henry, and thy children from thy attached Cousin

My very dear friends —

We have just finished   reading in the Montrose papers, which my daughter Annie   Sayne brought down to me this p.m. – the account of the   Dedication of dear Clemmie’s donation to all the people of   old Susq: Co: & under its inspiration I feel that I must   immediately x x x x –––––––––1908 Jan. 4th –

— To prove that my dear friends have   not been entirely forgotten, – I have the audacity to   continue this letter – begun so long ago as almost to be   forgotten unless it be for this purpose! –  An interruption   occurred, during which time Minnie told me that she was   writing or had written to you, & when I asked where she wd.   address it, she said "Oh, in c/o Misses Biddle – they are in   Montrose". —  I demurred, but neither of us knew theGermantown address & altho’ I said "No. 1. Walnut St."   always held a clue – & had for nearly 100 yrs. past, – but   she laughed, – said that date was obsolete, – & now I doubt   if you ever did get her letter! –  I wish I cd. see you, & I   think our tongues wd. travel fast, –  Writing has become   rather irksome to me, – particularly with pen & ink as my   fingers have very much stiffened in my old age – so I   generally write with a pencil(when I think my frds. will not   object,) & I do not write much, except to my two sons, – who   are in R.R.d business at Sydney,– Nova Scotia. —

— We   have had such a hard summer,– partly owing to the delusions   these conceited Virginians had,– that "all the world & his   wife" wd. almost break their necks to get here to see their   wonderful state & its historic surroundings – then their   disappointments & losses were not cheerful or conducive to   cheery letter writing, & I hate to write doleful letters. —If it were not so pathetic,– it wd. be very amusing to see   the downfall of the hopes they all had of making such   enormous fortunes.–  Hundreds & thousands of dollars have   been lost, for the whole thing was a complete fizzle & not   being completed until away into October, & therefore but   little attendance,– those who did come disparaging it, & the   day after the gates were closed, it was put right into the   hands of a receiver!! –  Virginia has not had such a   staggering blow since Appomattox! –

— We have seen   very little ofMiss Walcott altho we attend the same church, but she lives   at the farther side of our town & the trip involves a   trolley ride- a ferry across Hapton Creek & a walk to each   end of the line.-
I am so sorry to hear of Carrie’s   increased deafness, - & descouraged too.- for I have grown   very deaf myself. & when she had all the medical faculty of   Europe to consult, & they did not cure her, - it is not   worth while for me to try. - Is it hereditary with her?- I   don’t remember either of your parents beingafflicted in that way. –  The strongest point in my memory   about them – is your father’s good sound "orthodox" dignity   – always so cheerily smoothed over, by your Mother’s   beautiful almost angelic smile which brightened almost   everybody & everything around them. –  I don’t wonder he   went to bed, when she was taken from him, & could never be   persuaded to rise again. –  I must close this now for my   messenger to take to the post office. –

— How I do   wish you would come to see us.  I hardly know any one who   would be more welcome. –  Now, think it over & see if you   can’t come,– particularly if a cold wave strikes Germantown.   —

Good bye – in which both my girls join, – don’t   ever doubt me, but believe me always your loving &   affectionate friend
Sibylla T. Morris.

Title: 1841 April, to Frank, Philada.

Dear Frank
Somewhere in the Month of April, AD      1841

If you are in want of a mystery profound enough      to merit the attention and task the scrutiny of your      powerful mind - endeavor to ascertain if you can what whim      has led me to take this mammoth sheet for my letter instead      of confining myself as heretofore to the narrower limits of      a [Quarto]  It has puzzled me – I thought first of greatness      in the Abstract – how greatness Sympathises with greatness –      How you cant get a Barrel of praties in a Bushel Basket –      and wondered if that was the reason – Some I reasoned Are      born to greatness – some achieve greatness and some have      greatness thrust upon them – and I have come to that      conclusion that struggle against it as I may in spite of all      I may do – greatness is my destiny. ------

“Tantaeni      animis celestibus irae!!” as [Maro] said when the Caelicoli      plagued poor Aeneas half out of his wits. ---  I know      Francis that the provocation was extreme – like unto the      emotions of a female Tiger robbed of her young by some      felonious and ruthless hand – some Yankee Menagerie-Keeper –      who reflects (not the Keeper but the Tiger) that her striped      Darlings will be exposed to the vulgar eye far from their      native land. far from her and from her caresses. – who knows      that in them she has lost perhaps the prop of her declining      years and feels that she is altogether lonely –      

“They will never come she said”
“She said I am      a-weary a-weary”
“Would God that I were dead”!      –

like unto her heart-rending emotions are emotions      of a Poet moaning over the loss the abstraction by      unhallowed hands of his fancy’s creations – his children of      the Brain  She whet her incisors – He mends his pen –      
Her sullen growl resounds thro the forest. = fearful      flies the trembling thief – the invader of their domestic      hearth and social joys. – She sees him in the blue distance      farther than any eye can pierce save the eye of a Mother      bereaved of her offspring --  Guilty wretch! and dont thou      expect such crimes to prosper – Fly as thou may the avenger      is behind – She springs from the tangled Brush – one blow      and her little ones are free and the blood of the ravisher =      washes down his bones – The Poets eye rolls in indignant      fury – He paces up and down – and much Ink must be shed.       Black ink – to expiate his wrongs ------

But Frank I      quote from “L’Entreprise No. 8” “Memory is mortal      forgiveness divine” – There is a difference between the      charity of the Christian and the blind revenge of the beasts      that perish – and I see that thou art well acquainted with      the precept concerning the smiting of one cheek and the      subsequent turning of the other – since – when thou wast      informed of the use I had made of thy Serenade thee sends me      on another piece which I am sorely tempted to appropriate to      the same purpose – viz. “The Thief” an Indignation ode      -----

But “L’Entreprise” is of the things that have      been = its star has set – When it again rises and illumes      our horizon once more – any pieces you may favor me with      will meet with particular attention and speedy insertion –      To Encourage your Modesty I will only hint
at the numerous encores and complimentary remarks which I      appropriated at its reading in our Junto. – I must confess I      had some conscience pangs – at thus robbing you of your due      and ventured to hint that they were entirely mistaken about      the Authorship – But all that was attributed to my modesty      and I could not make them believe it – So any more Serenades      you want inserted or Indignation Odes – either – send them      along and I’ll father ‘em with pleasure ----

As to      that little Biographical sketch in the “Ledger” the idea      pleases me exceedingly – It is not always the fate of Genius      to hear its praises Its requiem is rarely listened to – till      Death has untuned the Ear to praise and “cold obstruction”      chilled the heart and closed the eye – But sometimes Fate      decrees otherwise. -- & To your hands I commit with pleasure      myself and my memory – and to encourage you I think you      would make considerable of a Buzzy – I had thought some time      since I could trace thy classic pen in that respectable      Journal – Sometimes perhaps in the Poet’s corner – and again      I have suspected thy assistance (as Charles Lamb and Dun      Stuart have done before thee - ) [Reparter] “compiler      impromptu” composer and Wellerism manufacturer at a fippenny      bit a head

Dont forget Frank to put in how like twin      puppies we hunted the Muses together – How “hand in hand we      climbed the steep ascent of Parnassus” – and drank from the      same pitcher of the sparkling fountain – and if thee wishes      it I dont know that I shall object to thy inserting that      chaste production of thy blushing and almost virgin Muse –      the ode to Fanny – Though I bethink myself that piece would      better become the columns of the “Little Genius” – for there      was about it an independent air – a noble boldness which      some – nay, many – are too narrowed by the conventional and      affected delicacy of the day fully to appreciate and which      the Little Genius so openly advocates and patronises –      

With this I send you a critique on a Philadelphia      poet one who “blossomed in the desert air” of our unfriendly      climate but who like a wise prophet sought honor elsewhere –      No man is a hero to his valet’s deschambre and Pliny would      never have sucked Parnassian pap to advantage if he had      lived and died a Teacher at Providence School – What a      blight this “Times” man seems to want to throw upon poor      Pliny’s Laurels.  – No mincing matters Regulae cut & slash.       – When I see such an article I always fancy the Burden on my      own shoulders – Just Fancy some of your Serenades served in      the same style – Not kidnapped – eloped with out of pure      affection but barbarously mangled, murdered, its throat cut      from ear to ear.  – Like to a Tiger &c &c (on the other page      - )

New England Yearly Meeting of Friends is held at      New Port from 7th day the 12th of the 6th month to 6th day      the 18th inclusive commencing with the Meeting for      Sufferings – which however thou knowst is only patent to      Cardinals and chief priests of the synagogue First Day is      generally “the Yearly Meeting” par eminence and is usually a      great day at New Port.  Then may be seen straight coats of      the strictest sort – straight coats of a more accommodating      
curve – straight coats which one would hardly know were      straight and it grieves me to mention – some utterly devoid      of straightness – Broad Brims black, drab, or otherwise from      six inches in diameter to a lesser number – or a fraction –      Bonnets which the unsullied snow wreath could not rival in      maiden purity setting off eyes of all colors – noses of all      shapes – and mouths of all degrees of prettiness –      interspersed with some of the adornment of the daughters of      vanity ------ flitting past in crowds – and every now & then      the youth of the company indulging in cachinnations calling      down upon them with speedy rebuke of the more serious &      elderly – while old peaceable looking chassis and wagons      drawn by the most demure looking ponies in the world string      along through the streets and all bound to Yearly-Meeting –      New Port has many other attractions besides Yearly Meeting      however – The ride on the Beach – the Glen the [Fort] and      the Sail in the Harbour take away considerably from the      tedium of the long sittings – and besides Paradise &      Purgatory can be visited – much easier than was done in the      times of Hercules & pious Aeneas – as to the girls I have      often told them that I worship them
“as      stars

Whose purity and distance make them      fair”
and thee must get another pilot when thee comes on      such sounding but I do not despair however and may perhaps      with a few Lessons from thee become “a nice young      man”
All this I put forth expecting you to come & visit      us then – If you will be there – day & month aforesaid – I      will meet you and I think I may promise you a pleasant week      – Harry I suppose put more faith in Fanny [Ell---] than in      any one else – so he will hardly affect a Yearly Meeting of      the spiritually “Exercised –

My Dear Cousin Jonathan Evans

Thine of   yesterday is at hand--I am not sorry I wrote to thee as thy   answer assures me there was misapprehension on my part as to   thy expression. We had spoken of the discipline at Westtown   and of the laying aside of rules there and at Haverford   which were difficult of enforcement and some of them   unnecessary to proper order. Afterwards, if I recollect   right, thee expressed thyself in favor of rescinding all   rules, the word discipline being used; which I supposed   referred to that of our Y.Mg. when I now think the   discipline at Westtown may have been in thy mind.
I am   glad to be corrected, and to have thy opinion of the Revised   Discipline as given in thy letter.--I greatly long
to have unity of belief and effort in upholding essential   Truth and its principles by Friends, and increased   recognition of the intent of our Lord and Master when He   taught His followers the deep meaning of "The Kingdom of   Heaven."
Some few practices of the most substantial   Friends I am willing to leave to individual conscience for   adoption, if their rejection does not contravene any plainly   stated law or principle in the New Testament.  Thus in   dress, simplicity is conformity to the law of Christianity;   and truthfulness is necessary to speech when addressing   others.

With love thy cousin

I think that I can fully   understand thy feelings as expressed in thy touching note of   last week--and have waited to reply, until the Friends   having the matter in charge, could confer together;
this they did this morning; and now I must tell thee, that   after giving our earnest consideration to the subject, the   proposal of thy name for this service was our unanimous   decision; and I was requested to let thee know that thee had   been thought of as most suitable, by each member of our   committee before we mettogether: May we not conclude therefore, that this decision   is in the right ordering, according to our best light and   Judgment, while hoping that thee will be willing to accept   it as such.
And now may I personally express my sympathy   for thee, should thee feel it right to serve in this   responsible position--and also the desire that thee may   realize the words "He giveth forever to the faint; and to   them that have no might he increaseth strength."  
While   I remain with love Sincerely thy friend

Dear Tom,
Thee must excuse   me for having been so long answering thy letter, & not think   that I did not care about it, for I was right pleased that   thee wrote to me, & I have said to myself ever so many times   [said] that I must write to that “Little “Toms”—  but thee   sees now I have got to be a school mistress, I have so many   cares that I cant always do[o] what I’d like & then I have   had a good many letters to write to different people &   knowing that thee saw the home ones & knew all about me, I   took it the easier.
I have now been “school”mom=’en” long   enough to get a prety good idea of the business – & my idea   of it is, thatits a good deal easier to be a scholar than I teacher, – so   thee can remember that for thy comfort when thee has a hard   lesson to learn.  To teach a school of troublesome boys I   shd. say was one of the hardest businesses’s that cld. well   be got up..  The girls are bad enough, but when it comes to   boys – – they’re the [---] of man.  I have in my school   about 35 boys & a dozen girls between the ages of 6 & 15 —   The girls I have but little trouble with, but the little   boys are regular monkeys.  No sooner is my back turned than   they begin their discussions of wh. they have a variety —    Its the hardest thing in the world to keep them still, & if   they get a good chance there’s not one of them that is too   good to get up & takea dance or a fight or any other such little amusement that   they think will set the school in an uproar.+  [+ Throwing   spit balls is a very bad habit they have – also dancing “Ham   fat”]  My punishments are various.  Sometimes I shake the   culprit & if that wont do, tie em up hand & foot & put em in   the corner — wh. is a very troublesome operation to me.  But   it seems as if nothing wld. beat it into their heads that   school is any thing but a place to play in.  
Most of   them can read a little some not at all, & like “Busy” – they   must always spell girl gril and dirt – drit –.  It seems as   if it came natural —  One of their best accomplishments is   singing wh. we sometimes let them do in school.  My children   know “my”native country thee” & the colored “Wolunteer”— wh.   they shout out with great effect. But I guess I’ve told thee   enough about the darkies  We’ll talk a little abt.the whites.  How comes on work at Haverford?  By the way thy   hand writing is coming on so well, that when I got thy   letter I thot. it was Busy’s himself, it was so good.    Have’nt you a boy named Allen Thomas,?  I expect he’s a nice   fellow & has two very nice brothers whom I met last eveng.    There are [---] pleasant frieds here & I do not often have a   chance to feel lonely or home sick.  How does Prof. Cope &   his botany lectures?  I am going to try to write him a note   to send in this & consequently must say farewell or shall   not have time.  Thee can take this down home with thee next   7th day & tell ‘em it’s all they’ll get this week.— as they   dont deserve any for some time.  Give my love to all, & if   thee gets time write again to thy affec sister C

My dear   friend
Rachel C. Evans.

In carrying out our   program for Switzerland, the weather has suddenly changed   from intense heat and a very long drought to a rain of   several days, which while most grateful to the parched   country, interferes materially with views of the charming   Lake of Geneva and the mountains that environ it. Instead   therefore, of our usual outdoor life, this gives just the   opportunity for which I've been wishing, to acknowledge some   of the very kind farewell greetings, received as we left our   native shores. The weather being so variable, it has seemed   best for one to remain in this most comfortable   Eng.-speaking pension, with a delightful out-look upon the   Lake, while my dear Hannah has gone into the 
upper regions, so as to get into closer touch with their   sublime peaks--at least so far as the fickle weather may   permit. Meanwhile therefore, my pen is giving me congenial   occupation in-doors.
Among the loving remembrances to   which I have referred, is thine from Franconia, U. N. of   [--] 28--I was truly glad also thus to receive good accounts   from you, and can only trust your outing in the bracing air   of New Eng. may be permanently helpful to thyself and your   dear Anna, of whom I often think with tender sympathy,   desiring that "the best of Physicians"--may keep her under   his all-wise and loving care. Turning away therefore, from   misgivings, or fears, or failures as they may seem to her,   may there be a more "continual looking into Jesus", not only   "as the author", but "the finisher of her faith". Let her   ever remember that it is this same Saviour of our's, who has   begun his work of grace in her heart that seeks to carry it   on and perfect it
to his praise, and her unspeakable peace. He knows her   better than she knows herself; and therefore, none so well   as He can "speak to her condition". It is thus He has   revealed himself to multitudes of struggling souls, and they   never seek His face in vain. Then it is that anxiety gives   place to a quiet childlike confidence in Him, and impatience   as to a more rapid growth in grace than we may have yet   known finds us more continually dwelling upon the abounding   love of God, and brings about that "patient waiting for   Christ", which the apostle craves for his fellow   believers.
While our best desires are turned in this   direction, there is nothing incompatible with the fullest   appreciation of the outward favors & blessings with which   our Heavenly Father has surrounded us. Indeed, we now   realize that these he has "given us richly to enjoy". We   recognize His good hand in them all, and so a continual   thanksgiving goes up from our hearts to Him, as the   all-bountiful giver. I see little to add to the few
hints as above, and would have thee to use them or not, only   as way may open--Indeed I can quite believe that, if a   fitting, natural opening does not occur, it may be best to   speak to Anna of nothing beyond my continued loving interest   in her.
As to the results of our own rambling, I may   thankfully say that, for myself, there seems a marked gain   in several respects, but, as thou has intimated, the full   benefit of such changes is sometimes felt later. My dear   Hannah could scarcely be in better condition for enjoying to   the full the scenes of rare interest and beauty thr'o which   we are and have been passing. I think however, we shall both   be glad when the time for our return voyage shall have come.   This will be 10/5, by the "Haverford", for Phila, and   shortly after, if the Lord will, we may hope to be once more   among our dear home friends--Please remember us in love to   Jon., while I remain

very sincerely thy friend
Sam   Morris

Springfield. Mass. Aug. 31st
4th day eve.

Dear   Papa & Mama,
We rec’d your letters this morning just as   we started & were very glad to get them, tho’ sorry to think   they came too late to engage rooms for you at the Cliff   House we were very anxious to hear from you in time, but you   were so long making up your minds, that we almost came to   the conclusion you were not going to at all, & had given it   up.  However Uncle H. thinks there will be no trouble in   getting them by writing afterwards.  We left Newport at 7   o’clock this morning & dined at Worcester very comfortably   about 2 o’clock & arrived here at 6 1/2 about.  Thishotel is delightful, they say it is one of the best in the   Union Sallie Parish says “its where all the brides come to,”   I haven’t seen any yet!  We got a splendid supper & Uncle   Harry & Chell & I took a little stroll through the town  it   seems very pretty as far as gas and star-light would show.    But me thinks we will not see much more of it, we propose   leaving quite early tomorrow morning for [Mt.] Holyoke.    Aunt Mary says “that all things considered she is certainly   remarkably well,” last 1st day she says she felt better than   she has for a year.  She is certainly improved, but don’t   raise your hopes to high or I fear you will be disappointed   – She’s better, but not well.  
They are talking,   talking! all the time, & I can’t write, Aunt [K]. has a very   nice room on the secondfloor, & Chell, Ginnie, & I have three cots put up in an   adjoining private parlor, its quite fine we’re all seated   round the centre table with a bright gas-light above us & a   velvate carpet beneath us, & the most delightful easy chairs   aren’t we splendid?  
Uncle H. says our present intention   is to come home in the 2 o’cl train 7th day (if the   time-table is right) I think we’ll not get out [--] 4, if we   change our plans we’ll telegraph.  Now Mother I must stop   for I want to fix my hat & its getting late.  Aunt M. says   she would have written but she has been retrimming Anna’s   hat & had no time.  Love to all
very   affec’ly
Lillie

P.S.  Resolved-that we take dinner   at Aunt [Annas], & come in quarter before 4P.S.  resolved that you need not expect us till we   come
P.S.  thats wrong!
P.S.  We will probably come   out in the 9 o’clock cars taking tea at the   Continental.
P.S.  Still talking can’t tell if this be   the final decision!
P.S.  Final decision! Seriously!  It   is extremely difficult to fix our plans, & we will   positively come home on 7th day either 1/4 4 or 9 o’cl   trains.
P.S.  Uncle Harry thinks we ought to give a   reason for our indecision.  Reason That we can not find   beforehand how long it will take to visit Mt. Holyoke as we   have to drive part of the way, & that makes it uncertain   whether we will reach New Haven tomorrow night or the next   day

Bristol July 13. 1771 – 7th day 1 oClock
My dear   Sister

My Henry came here last evening in seeming   good spirits but indifferent Health; he eat a very light   supper, and sett off this morning (after a poor breakfast)   about 8 oClock.  He has a fine day, and I hope riding and   relaxation from business will restore him; he talked of   returning to Bristol on 5th day or perhaps not untill 7th   day next.  Thy continued Confinement and constant care give   me many an anxious minute; but I trust the time will come   when it may please kind Providence to make things easier to   thee.  I was not quite so well yesterday as usual & my dear   Henrys coming to me so unwell gave me pain.  I am quite   bravely to day after coming out of the water but full of   thought about my dear little crowing Henry.  Doct. D.*   [*Denormandie] came here last evening, and, after the usual   salutation, said to me, he was come to have some serious   talk with me; I smiled; nay said he I am in earnest; about   what Doctor? – weaning your little son; such a hearty   growing boy, who seems to live upon you, is enough to draw a   pain in a weakly person, where there had never been one   before; besides he keeps you waking at nights, and prevents   your using means that might restore you; if it was not on   his account you might now go with Mr. Drinker to the sea   shore, and so forth.  There are several women here who I   beleive have put it into the Doctors head that I ought not   to suckle the Child.  My Henry seconded him, and said he   would write this morning to thee, but as he was poorly, I   undertook to do it.–  Do not think my dear, from what I have   written, that I am worse; Indeed I am not through mercy, but   have had the pain in my breast oftener than I had sometime   ago, which I told the Doctor.  I beleive that if I had a   Girl with me that was worth a fig, it would be different,   for the one I have has no knack of making the Child fond of   her.  Doctr. D. says as Doctr. Evans knows my Constitution,   he would have him spoken to. –  I would have thee see the   Doctor and talk with him.  Patty would do a great deal   better than the Girl I have, and should she offer again, I   would not have thee entirely discourage her, but tell her   thee beleives the girl I have does not suit me, and if she   thinks she can behave so as to please me, thee would have   her call again.  It will be time enough (after theehas spoken to Doct. Evans) to come to any conclusion when my   Henry returns.  I had a room full of visitors yesterday   afternoon; two Chariotts full besides others; T. Ringold &   Wife from Maryland; Sally Hoffman, Sukey Pintard, her sister   Boudinott from New York; Serlis’ wife, Betsy Tilghman from   Philada. and Billy Coxe’s daughter, and Sally Tredwell the   Doctors sister.  We all went in the evening to Bath.  I go   but little a visiting, and they all think that my little   dear keeps me at home, and every ones cry is wean him, wean   him; thee would be charmed to see the dear little fellow,   how he daily improves in cunning antick tricks.  I long to   see thee and my dear Children, but dont know how to bring it   about.  My Henry was saying that he was well pleased that I   did not get his letter by Billy Hodge (as he had mentioned   thy being unwell) as thee is now better. – I would have thee   my dear take half a spoonful of the Elixir every day to   strengthen thee.  I have not had occasion to take any since   I came up as yet, but thee knows it was of great use to me   taken in small quantity.  I have been but a little while   writing thus far, but as I have not stopped since I began, I   grow tired, and my dear little one is crying for me; My dear   love is to thee & to my sweet Children, to whom I intend to   write when I can conveniently; they must not be impatient,   but good and kind to each other, & very dutiful & mindful of   their Aunty’s will, which will give great pleasure to their   very affectionate mammy
I am, my dear Sister, thine &c   –
E. Drinker

My dear, dear, kind Henry looked so   unwell as he slept this morning as made my heart ache; he   was last night more than commonly chearful, which I have   observed often to be the case when he is unwell.  how unlike   the generality of Mankind is he in his natural disposition   many ways.  he was last night at supper affectionately   acknowledging thy tender care of him, & saying how clever it   was to have two Wives.  We were likewise wishing that it was   convenient to thee to spend one month here, free from care   of us & ours. –  I hope it may please God to spare me and   restore me to health for my Henrys sake, & that I may be   enabled to make up in some measure to my dear Husband and   Sister their many, many kindnesses to me; but shouldshould it happen otherwise, may I be enabled to say, the   Lords will be done. –

5 oClock – Billy Parr has been   here; he says he saw thee, & that you are all well.  he has   gone to Trenton, where Peggy, Nancy and Caleb are to go   tomorrow; they want me to go, but I shall not.  Molly Foulke   is expected here this evening or in the morning.  Mag.   Divine next second day, so that we shall have the house   full.  Peggy gives her love to thee.  Henry’s asleep, & I am   going to Bath.  farewell my dear Sister for the   present.
E.D.
I wrote yesterday by S. Le Gay, which   letter I suppose thee has received.  I make no doubt but my   dear Henry will return bravely.  tomorrow will be a lonesome   day to me.  my love to neighbour James –

Laurel House July 19th

My  dear Mama,
Rachel has   spent herself so in writing to thee that it seemed hardly   worth while for me to try, so I thought I wld. wait till her   fever was over, & as this eve. she seemed little inclined to   desert the piazza, I concluded to undertake the task.  We   have had a most exercising day in all senses of the word,   but so wonderful is the effect of this mountain air that I   do not feel the least tired.  In the first place this   morning we set off in an open wagon for Haines’ fall a   pleasant ride of about 2 miles, but it was after we got   there the “tug of war” began –  We hada regular scramble, part of the way was so rough that Tom &   Walter concluded to remain behind & before we got through   there was no one left but Harry Ellie & Madge & I, we went   down to the very foot of the lower falls, & were well   repaid; it was a most beautiful spot, a succession of six   lovely little falls ending in cascades & rapids, it was   altogether quite charming, the prettiest place of the kind I   ever saw, & I don’t remember ever to have seen a photograph   of it –  We did not get home till after the dinner bell had   rung, so were obliged just to give a little smoothe to our   hair, & go in in our mountain dresses, but every thing is   very primitive here, & nobody pretends to dress for dinner.    As we were all preparedwe concluded instead of changing our dresses to go after   dinner down the stream about a mile to Bastion falls under   Tom’s piloting, & soon comes in the adventure – we just got   to the head of the fall, & were [nerving] ourselves for a   scramble to the foot, when some one remarked that it was   raining, & sure enough it was, we took shelter under some   trees and concluded it wld. soon be over, & we would wait,   but it got harder & harder, & at last found its way through   the branches, & came down on us in large drops, which were   decidedly wetting, we tried it for a little while, but   finding there was no sign of stopping & we were getting very   wet we concluded to push on home, –  At first it seemed to   have slaked alittle, but it soon began harder than ever, & we went   tearing along jumping over rocks & through bushes till we at   last arrived at the foot of the Kauterskill, & then there   were all those dreadful stairs to go up – however we pushed   on, & at last arrived panting at the house – we were pretty   objects to be sure all wet, & draggled, & hot – there were   several gentlemen sitting round on the piazza, & I thought   it a remarkable instance of politeness that they did not   ever smile, I’m sure I could not have resisted it.  Of   course we retired immediately to our appartments, & changed   every thing making ourselves most comportable & desidedly   more presentable.  Thee need not feel the least concern for   I don’t think we are any of us a bitthe worse, & the most remarkable part is we are not tired.    The only thing that suffered was our hats, but I guess they   will look pretty well when they dry, & we’ll have to retrim   them at Newport –  Thee must be sure & not forget my bonnet   so that if we should arrive 7th day night I may have   something to wear to meeting.  Also mother I think I forgot   to put on the list a thin white body of mine & my best   underbody that I wanted to have done up & brought in the   trunk – Virginia will know.  Tom wrote to Father yesterday   to go by 7th days steamer, & one of us will try to write by   the next.  We are having a most delightful time, & as thee   willsee by my account I am as well as possible, so thee need not   have any anxiety on my account.  I do hope you are getting   along nicely, & don’t feel very lonely, I know thee must   miss Father very much, but I hope he will be a great deal   better for his voyage & come home to us quite strong, & free   from all those miserable head-aches.  
Aunt L & Chell   send love, & the former says she is intending to write to   thee very soon.  
Give a great deal of love to all, &   Virginia especially I want to write to her, she was so very   kind in helping me to get ready to come away, I don’t know   what I should have done without her.  
Good-night dear   Mama,
thy ever loving
Lily

B 6/7—65—

Dear Mother & sister Annte.

I think   I’ll address you collectively this time, as I suppose   Caroline’s head’ll be turned with weddings & unable to   appreciate common topics. I recd. yr. very interesting &   spirited epistles this morn.g & reply at once, in order that   you may not have cause to complain of remissness this time,   & upon what ground you did it last, I must say I cld. not   discover, as I think I have been up to the mark quite as   much as you have. Thy remarks [a] on properness &c were   quite edifying. I expect thee wd. be charmed with the   Baltimore people. They are certainly most social & charming   in their manners, tho’ I dont believe afterall, when you come to the foundation of things that there is   any more good substantial material among them than among   some of that despised class denominated "the proper." As to   the gentlemen I cant say that I have met any whom I consider   very deeply interesting As far as gallantry & politeness go   they are certainly very attractive Bt if we cld. only   introduce a little more of these elements with some of our   [imperturbables] I incline to think these wld. be found   quite as deep in the long run. I must say it is refreshing   to get hold of some thing that is more [impressible] than a   stone & I intend to [---] up Baltimore ways loudly when I   get home. Tell Cousin Mary she must hurry & come down as   fast as she can, or I fearI shall not get to have my sprees with her. This morn the   new teacher who is going to take my sch. arrived & I was   promoted or depressed I dont know wh. to the rank of   assistant to Mr Waterman, the principal of the sch. It is a   splendid change for me, as his room is much pleasanter & I   have none of the discipline to do but only the hearing of   the lessons—intellectually, it seems a most magnificent   advance frm. a-b only to geography and arithmetic & I shd.   be quite willing to teach there for weeks if it was’nt for   the hot weather, as it is, however, considering the [--] &c   I think I had better not stay much after the three months   are up wh. will be abt. the mid of June--& very soon—as you   will perceive, so you may make preparations for me, soon   after that time—I hope you’ll havepleasant little surprise prepared for me in the way of a   closet—wh. wont be the linen closet—I have to keep up such   an everlasting foolding and unfolding here that I shall be   perfectly delighted to get a place to "hang up" in.

I   expect I am indebted to my frd. Jesse for this release frm.   the infants—I said to him in joke some time ago that I thot,   I shd. give "notice" soon for them to get another teacher &   he took it in earnest but I am very glad, on some accts, as   I shd like to get some ideas about older teaching frm Mr.   W.

I expect you’ll enjoy [Mr. N’s] wedding most as   much as Lilly’s—There was a young gentleman here the other   day who told somebody that he thot L’s wedding was   dreadfully stupid, & that he thot’ one or two of the   bridesmaids (he did’nt say all) were the ugliest girls he   had ever seen—not a very complimentary speech I think.
As I shall probably come home so soon it will not be worth   while to send the things by express—tho’ if I cld only have   had them now they wld. have been exceedingly useful -- I   think maybe I’ll try & get myself a beige skt. here & we   shall not be likely to have many more tea parties now the   warm weather has come -- We’ve never heard any more abt.   Jessies strawberry party & we’re afraid he’s forgotten it.   He took us to a small one out at his bro. James’ night   before last. We went in a buggy & pair & came home by   moonlight—quite romantically -- The buggy is only used on   very romantic occasions, I believe. Its so nice here   moonlight nights—the ladies all dress up in their whites &   sit out on the front door steps, & go round [seeing?] one   another with beaux or beau less just as it happens.Has Fanny Drinker gone home? I reckon she has & where is   Cous. Sarah? Give my love to her if she is about still. I   ought to have written to her. Give my love also to all the   Wynndowners also please give my love & congratulations to   all the bride cousins & tell them I’m very sorry not to be   giving them anything-- Maybe if I aint so lazy I’ll make em   something after I get home. But dont tell em that. I believe   this is all I have to say at present—will write and fix the   day of course before I come. If Cous. M. comes soon please   send the shawl and the [b----] skt. as I [---] much love to   all—yrs. affec

April 29,1853

Will thee dear Clemmie accept this   little book as a token that I appreciated thy patient   endeavors to gratify my request; & also as a companion of   thy sorrowful thoughts, who would fain, with the blessing of   God, lead thee to peaceful meditations.--
Especially note   the introduction. Thee will find some passages marked; these   struck me as applicable to thy feelings--But do not feel   compelled to read
because I give; rather seek its counsels, as thee is drawn   by a sense of need; and perhaps thee may find a fountain of   joy which thee has never know yet. But it will only be as a   guide to the everlasting spring of peace which is in Jesus   our Saviour.
I opened my Bible to find a promise for thee   & this was the verse which met my eye. Isa xxxv 4 "Say to   them that are of a fearful heart, be strong, fear not:   behold your God will come with vengeance, even God 
with a recompense; he will come and save you." 
Will thee   not bend a listening ear, and a believing heart to such a   gracious message?
I have added a few thoughts on the last   leaf of the book; and with them wld. give the warm affection   of

Thy Cousin
Wills

Dear Uncle.
By   William Drinker who pass’d Here on the 9th  I receivd thy   remembrance of the 3d inst–  What Charles Miner has done or   is now about I cannot precisely say not hav[ing] seen Him or   any of his friends since [my] Last
I question the   Establishment of the proposed Bank at Wilkes barre & beleive   also that if it ever does go into Operation it will be by   compromise and by a [di----] of the few offices of [---]   attatched to it–  Humble merit will I presume stand but a   poor chance–
Mr Arndt on whom I depended for [the]   Hemlock Bark Has not yet ground it but I hope He will attend   to it shortly–  if it in any degree succeeds [in] England it   will be Highly important to this Count[r]y as well as   convenient to ship overseas–  I beleive that the mak[ing]   pot & pearl Ash might prove an advantageous thing to us more   than to any other persons [We] owning the nearest Large Body   of suitable timber for the purpose – if it will pay for its   mak[ing] & a reasonable sum for outlay & superintendance it   will answer us as a means of clear[ing] Land –
I am glad   that thy mind is made up for a peep at this quarter of the   world – I think it will be likely to be beneficial to thy   Health as also to Aunts – Some Rough travell[ing] there will   no doubt be – but generaly speak[ing] the Roads are   tolerable to the mouth of Tunkhannock–  Thereare no excelent Taverns on the Route so far as I am   acquainted–  I think the one Here is the Best & likely to be   the most pleasant for the Residence of aunt–  Gentlemen can   be well accomodated at Easton & at Wilkes barre at Mr Whites   in the first nammed place & at Mr Arndts in the second in   Both Houses there is Rather too much noise and Drink[ing] to   be entirely agreeable to Ladies –  Here also we have more   noise than is pleasant–  There be from 15 to 20 of Stoddarts   work[ing] hands quart[ere]d in the House –  
The Road by   Easton is Rather worse than that by Bethlehem & Nazareth & I   think generaly the accommodations are better on this last   Route–  from Nazareth to Hellers at the Wind gap at which   House I have generaly procured tolerable Eating & pretty   clean–  from thence about 17 miles to William Sox’s upon the   top of Pokono – where th[e]y make prety good coffee & give   you what ever they may Have in the House in a tolerably   cleanly stile–  from thence to this place say 12 miles   –
The present is about as pleasant a Time to Travel in   this county as any other Dur[ing] the summer – ere the grain   is cut which will not be Done before the Last of next monthHowever the Weather is now variable and we may expect   occasional Rains, until after Harvest – 
in the Last of   August & to the middle of September is generaly more settled   weather – as to the [Gnats] they Have already come & in the   woods Bite sharply–  This [they] will continue to Do until   September – But out of the woods we do not find them   Troublesome– There are not any curiosities worthy a name   from Philada to this place–  The Habits & manners of the   people on the Route may perhaps afford Something novel – The   scenery also & general Aspect of the County will be new –   [marbly] nature in Her Roughest garb will surround you – you   will have pure Air & pure water & I doubt not to good   [appetites] as to enable you to Encounter much coarser fare   than usual – in the neighbourhood of Easton-Bethlehem &   Nazareth is a lime stone county – & I would have you beware   of the water – it is no doubt wholesome but to persons   [unaccustomed] to it it is often unpleasant in its effects–   if I know when you intend com[ing] up I will endeavor to   join you at Hellers – I have been constantly interupted   since I began writing which must excuse this   scrawl–
affectionaly thy nephew. H.W.Drinker –Stoddartsville

2nd day eve
190 Calvert st

Dear Mother & sisters,   Tired as I am I must write you a few words to night, as I   shall probably be at the sch, in the morn & the mail closes   at 1 P.M. & I thought you’d like to know that we arrived   safely about 5 this aft. & I am installed in my new boarding   house wh. promises to be very nice.  They ladies were   exceedingly kind & welcomed me as if I had been an old   friend  They are so free & easy.  One of them Miss Talbot   came right up in my room & talked to me while I was getting   dressed – & was as kind as possible  They used to know uncle   Jasper & quantities of our friends, so that I begin to feel   quite at home already  It is a large 4story house with a very nice pleasant parlor, & a   comfortable dining room, where we had tea on a little   refreshment table—the 4 school “marms”—as cozy as possible.    They say “thee” & call me by name wh. makes me feel much   less strange
Jesse called a few minutes after we arrived   in his elegant carriage, having been to one of the dipots to   meet us, but we unfortunately had got out at the wrong one;   & very much out of our way.  The ladies seem in very   moderate circumstances only keeping one servant, & a sch. of   near 40 day scholars.   consequently they have not much time   to attend to housekeeping nor much talent in that way I shd.   think.  Their kindness however makes amends.The house is on a very high situation & there is a fine view   of the city fr[m]. my room, wh is in the 2nd story & very   airy & pleasant.  But there is no closet unfortunatley wh.   is remarkably home like & seems to be my fate.  Not a place   to hang a dress, but I have 5 beaureau drawers & can make   out.  So much for the house.  3rd day morn.  We went last   evening to see the sch. & I was most agreeably disappointed   in it in every respect..  The rooms are well ventilated &   airy & no disagreeable odour.  & their state of advancement   is surprising.  There were a few to be sure who reminded me   of Busy—in his attempt to spell girl—but mostly they were   astonishingly quick--& cld. add & subtract like quite   accomplished arithmeticaians.  Quite as fast as I cld.   myself.  They were mostly adults.  In the morningThey are children.
I am to have a class of 30 & am very   glad to find that I shall be in the school with Miss Field,   who is a very pleasant young lady about my own age I shd.   judge, & we can go backwards & forward to gether, & shall be   companionable I hope.  The morning session is frm. 9 till 1   1/2 not 3.  The evening teaching you can take part in or not   as you choose.  So it will not be very laborous & in every   respect, it is going to be I think, much pleasanter than I   had anticipated.  & if you are only satisfied I think I can   be very comfortable & enjoy the work & the change.Love to Cousin Sarah.

Oh Poesy! what wight of Wretched State
Een at the lowest   bottom of his woe
When griefs surround him or sad toils   await
When cold misfortunes hand doth round him   blow
But calls on thee to aid against the foe?
Come   gentle soother of wan misery’s train
Before the scowling   can away doth go
Come shower thy spirit down on me   again
*For Frank Cope wants a letter – shall he want in   vain!!!!
*Here the Poet alludes to Danae & Jupiter   olympus an ancient buck

So Henricus is dead! dead ere   his prime!
Alas! that he should share the doom of   man!
Who now is left to build the lofty   rhyme?
Although his altitude was but a span
It   [overtopped] his years. = But no man can
Add cubits to   his stature or his days –
Vain task to stop the fateful   cruel hand
That wields the gory scissons. -- Worldy   praise 
High thought – nor noble deed its destined course   delays. –

(Now all that second Paragraph is   gammon
But if you really think it worth the trouble
If   twill not seem like too great love of mammon
I think you   can get quite as much or double
Prime cost – besides –   perhaps – who knows the bubble
Called Fame / which you’ll   keep for commissions
I want the rhino – all besides is   stubble)
By handing it about without omission
‘Mong'st   those who loudest wail that he's gone to Perdition)
I want you to hand it particularly to Miss B. --------.    Send on the amount collected for the benefit of the author   as soon after the funeral as possible.---

But as in   olden time, when-freshly sprung
From the great Maker’s   hand – all Earth was fair
Excelling in its beauty – fresh   & young
When strength & health perfumed with the balmy   air 
And all Earth’s Gifts were far beyond compare   
With what now ‘neath Heaven’s weary blessing   grows
What time the grove Hesperia apples bare
From   out the salt salt wave fair Venus rose
Graceful her   dripping locks she round her did dispose

So from the   Sorrow tearful deep & sad
Which mourns thy memory   departed Shade
While oer the dust which erst thy spirit   clad
And the loved link which bound thee to us made
We   grieve thou coulds’t not Death’s cold hand evade
Who   plucks the brightest flowers – hard to please
[While]   tears fall fast from all that thou shouldst fade
Love   ever radiant though steeped in tears
Love-rosy tints the   clouds – Love sooths the foamy seas
or Love heavenly love   appears
Just as you please

all the while alluding   in an inexpressibly delicate manner to the very peculiar   situation in which Miss B. ----- and I find ourselves since   Harry’s departure  You may show them to the lady.  Present   them as the first fruits. ----
But enough of this nonsense -  If you are heartily tired of   it remember you began it. --  and when my Muse gets well   under weigh – like Addisons there’s no stopping her. -------   Father has been unwell for some time and so much so that a   good part of the business devolves on me – in connection   with some other domestic affairs – putting a very unlooked   for and regrettable veto on my proposed trip to Philada   –
Perhaps another year may bring around the same   expectations which I hope will not be disappointed
Before   that time however I trust to see you on [here] for although   it is not to be presumed that New Bedford alone should   possess sufficient attractions – to be the terminus of your   visit it may serve as a [stepping] stone to some place that   has more ---

Title: 1853 December 5, Philadelphia, to Clemmie

Phila. Decr. 5/1853

Does thee not dear Clemmie, open   my letter, with at least a cold, if not a repulsive   feeling?, thinking to thyself--again the unwelcome   subject,--would it had not come so soon--&c &c? I have but   one or two ideas to present at present, yet am thankful to   be permitted to do this.--Thy occupation about many things,   I do appreciate, and would never chide thee for--delay   or--naught else in answering me;--on the contrary can truly   say I have rarely received letters more truly satisfactory   than thine;--but one thing they lack, the joyful news that   thee has accepted the offer of salvation, and the effect of   this change in all thy words and feelings. I will hope for   this also;--for nothing is impossible with   God.

over
One thought is this; thee says thee has an unwilling   heart;--that the only reason thee can give for not resolving   is, thee is unwilling to resign the world;--did thee ever   think of this text "He will make them willing in the day of   his power"? God can give a willing heart;--Thy will is   corrupted, as well as all thy powers,--ask of him.--But thee   wld know if it is not better to omit prayer than to ask   "when I do not in reality desire these blessings, when my   mind is not in a fit state for prayer".--But if this is one   of thy necessities why not pray for it; pray, that thee may   pray aright; that thee may receive, first the desire, then   the blessing. Would thee neglect the only source from whence   salvation can come?--Satan will tempt thee to, and if he   succeed in this, needs no other temptation to insure his   end.--
Let me tell thee of a fact; a friend of mine (the   person who told me the circumstance/accompanied a young lady   when she visited a minister to speak of her soul's   salvation;--he urged that she shld. accept the offer of   redemption thru Christ, that
she should resolve whom she wld serve; she replied she cld.   not give up the world, but that she wanted to be a   christian;--"but you must choose, between the world &   death,--or--Jesus & his salvation.--I will leave you;"--he   did so for--some moments &retd.,--"have you resolved",--she   cld. not,--"You must determine whether you will be saved, or   lost," he waited a few moments, and with the deepest   emphasis she said "I will resolve".--from that day she was a   new creature, & for years past has, &now has, adorn her   profession.--Dear Clemmie, for a long while thee has been   halting; the Holy Spirit has not yet deserted thee; but he   may; and that is the second that I wld offer;--if thee   rejects him now he may not return, thee will succeed in   stifling his voice in thy heart--he will be grieved away,   and thy soul will be lost; can thee take this   responsibility?--Would it not be thy "soul's suicide"? Other   than wldst hearken even then in this thy day."--Sinner turn why will thee die?
God the Spirit asked thee   why:
He who all thy life has strove,
Wou'd thee to   embrace his love.
Will thou not his grace   receive?
Will thou still refuse to live?
O, thou dying   sinner why,
Why will thou for-ever die? A little tract   enclosed speaks in the same strain.--But thee fears to   possess a Christian's portion, because of trials &c, the   word of God says "Godliness is profitable with all things,   having the promise of the life that now is, & of that wh. is   to come."--And from my heart I can say that it is a most   delightful portion; I cannot tell thee all I think of it,   thee would weary, & time is not;--but I wld not exchange the   joys I have had for all the world can give; & that which we   hope for is "a far more exceeding, and eternal insight of   glory."--and this is freely offered to thee.--Now my dear   Cousin I leave thee for the present,--will thee not   resolve?--
Let me give thee some news; we are only pretty   well all having colds; Nellie walks down stairs & round the   yard & is pretty bright; Father not retd yet, are hoping for   a letter to say when; Maggie & [-oll] are with us Catter has   been sick but is better. Carrie spent an aft. & eve at our   house & is as lovely as ever, comes soon to stay several   days.--Have not seen our fds at Bristol or recd aught fm   them since I saw thee. Love to Aunt Susan & Uncle   Wm.--Hoping--yet fearing for thee; As ever

Sept. 17th. 1862.

Dear Chellie, 
I have been      waiting for news, before answering your last letter and am      now not much better off, but you write such very short      letters that I am not at all conscientious about making mine      short also.  I wish my dear, that you would make your      letters a little longer, & if you do not you will see mine      gradually decreasing in length, till there is hardly any      letter at all.  Uncle James went off to Harrisburg on Monday      as did Uncle Clem George Emlen John Thayre (my cousins) and      Cousin George Biddle.  Uncle Clem never told a soul that he      was going and on Sunday night when John went to the      Baltimore depot to see Gerge Emlen and John Thayre off to      his surprise he saw Uncle Clem.He was going off without bidding us good-bye when perhaps we      may never see him again.  He always was very queer but this      beats every thing.  Is not the war news splendid?  I have      not been so glad since the battle of Drainsville,      particularly about Howell Cobb the old traitor.  There is      now not the slightest fear of our having Stonewall Jackson      in Philadelphia but I pity the poor citizens of Cincinnati.       Cousin Sam Cox was called to a churchthere (St. Paul’s) and he accepted.  He left town two weeks      from yesterday and when he arrived at Cincinnati he was not      allowed to enter the city but was sent to a boarding house      about two miles from the city.  There he is now with his      wife children and father.  Of their furniture they know      nothing and are not allowed to go to the city to see about      it.  Every morning at five o’clock all the bells in the town      ring and every man who is able to carry a gun assembles in      some perminent place and from thence they go out into the      country to wait for the enemy.  Even clergymen are forced to      fight & Cousin Sam is in almost hourly fear of being made to      serve.  I received a letter from Martha Henderson just now.They are at present in Wiesbaden and Martha says that if her      relations were with her she would never again wish to leave      there, not even for America.  That I cannot understand for      no place can or will ever be the same to me as dear      Philadelphia.  But I am forgetting my determination to make      my letter short and although I am burning to go on I deny      myself for your good as I think a little correction will be      very beneficial to you so I will sign myself y
your ever      loving and for long letters begging friend

Dear Sister–
I   recieved thy note (for I cannot call it a letter because it   contained so much nonsense) yester-day morning; but I did   not say poo! because I had an idea it was from Rachel or at   least hoped it did not contain nonsense.  I was glad to   recieve such information as thy note contained, & thought it   was a great compliment to be called handsome by sombody,   although I do not think father was much complimented by   having his hair called an iron gray color; unfortunatly I   did not lose my heart with her, although I think I must have   seen her & was very sorry I could not go to meting but my   knee was not equal to it.  I could have found some time to   write to you or thee butI have been very lazy since I have been here.  I delivered   thy message to Father (about Dr Thomas) but fear he has   forgotten about it, so I will remind him of it & now I must   close for I am getting lazy & will tell thee what we are   doing when there is some thing to tell about of more   consequence.  I believe Mother intends writing a   P.S.

I am sorry there should be any   mistake about Dr. Thomas  I thought I told you, you would   have to send him word when you were ready to begin  You had   better tell him of myabsence from home so that he may understand why he was not   called on before.  So much for that - the burden of my   [----] is “painting.”  It is the burden on my mind & must of   course show itself in words.  Uncle Tom sent me word that he   had expressed a sample of color which Craig has prepared for   our inspection.  I suppose we may get the package tomorrow –   but what troubles me is the delay – Craig said he would have   it all done so we could come back the 20th.  If he has got   to put on two coats after he hears from us I fear he will   not be ready for us.  We are getting tired of this plan &   anxious to know whether there will be any difficulty about   getting intoour house on the 22nd.  Seventh day week - We have to engage   Staterooms two weeks before to get good ones & I intend   tomorrow to engage them for 6th day the 21st & if you find   the house cannot be got ready by that time you will please   send us word at once so that we can disengage the rooms.    Perhaps if Craig can not get all done & dry he can have the   kitchen & back passages finished & if the last coat is on   the parlors &c we might come in before it is dry–  I feel   sorry to have filled up Toms sheet with nothing but such a   message – try to do better next time.  It has been blowing   strong from the N.W. all day & is cold as charity Alf &   Hazen went to meeting with me in the morning & your   [br]other in the afternoon but its dull work here either   at the larger or smaller body Yankee self conceit shows   nowhere more.

Dear Sister–
I   recieved thy note (for I cannot call it a letter because it   contained so much nonsense) yester-day morning; but I did   not say poo! because I had an idea it was from Rachel or at   least hoped it did not contain nonsense.  I was glad to   recieve such information as thy note contained, & thought it   was a great compliment to be called handsome by sombody,   although I do not think father was much complimented by   having his hair called an iron gray color; unfortunatly I   did not lose my heart with her, although I think I must have   seen her & was very sorry I could not go to meting but my   knee was not equal to it.  I could have found some time to   write to you or thee butI have been very lazy since I have been here.  I delivered   thy message to Father (about Dr Thomas) but fear he has   forgotten about it, so I will remind him of it & now I must   close for I am getting lazy & will tell thee what we are   doing when there is some thing to tell about of more   consequence.  I believe Mother intends writing a   P.S.
Affec thy brother
TP. Cope Jr
P.S.  when I   said you on the first page near the bottom I meat Rachel &   thyself.  TP Cope Jr.

I am sorry there should be any   mistake about Dr. Thomas  I thought I told you, you would   have to send him word when you were ready to begin  You had   better tell him of myabsence from home so that he may understand why he was not   called on before.  So much for that - the burden of my   [----] is “painting.”  It is the burden on my mind & must of   course show itself in words.

Second day morn  3. 27.

My dearest children
I have   just come home from school & found yr. letter on the card   plate in the entry, wh. is where they always put them, so we   can be refreshed by the sight the moment we get in, & I was   refreshed I assure you.  Miss Field gets a great many & I   began to feel as if it was quite time for me to be having my   turn too.  You must remember that I never was befor so   entirely among strangers. & that your letters now will be my   best substitutes for home, as I shall depend on them greatly   I tried to write yesterday but did not make out much.  It   was my first 1st day in Baltimore.  Do you remember last 1st   day, when [were] were walking on the piazza & wondering   whether I shd. be here?  I did not much think I shd. then   but it seems I am.  Went to meeting yesterday morn. wh. I   quite enjoyed.  The only faces that I had ever seen before   were Deborah Thomas, Margy Coale & Tammie Miller.  I was   introduced to lots of others who were all very kind, & said   they were coming to see me.  There was a frd. named Elicott   & her two sisters who I think said they knew Mother.  We had   a sermon [fmr.] Deba  Thomas, the Dr, & one or two others.    After meeting in the aftnoon I set out to take a walk & was   joined by a young lady named Mary Elicott & & Jesse, who   took me a beautiful walk out to whats called theReservoir, where there is a fountain and a splendid view of   green hills & also of the distant waters of the bay, as well   as of parts of the city.  & yet it was not a walk of more   than a mile I shd. think
Baltimore is certainly a   beautiful place & I never realized before so fully what an   advantage what an advantage a hilly city possesses over a   flat one.  It quite throws Philada into the shade as far as   beauty is concerned.  There is such a refreshing variety in   the style of the houses, & other [buildings] & the hills   show them off to great advantage.  Charles St. seems to be   one of the most aristocratic in wh. the monument is   situated, a very beautiful column of white marble, 170 ft   high wh. as it stands upon a hill serves as a land mark for   a long distance round.  as you ascend the street with the   monument towering high above you the stars & stripes   floating over it & the city as you catch glimpses of it at   certain points apparently beneath you, the effect is very   imposing.  I think Phila. wld. strike one as flat after   this.  It has its advantages tho’.
Jesse has not come to   take us any rides yet.  tho he has promised to.  They say he   is very attentive to a certain – young lady here so we shall   not be so likely to derive as much benefit.  [---]. He has   been very polite so far.  & the ladies of the house are   continually laying plans for our entertainment wh. is   exceedingly kind in them.  I really feel more at home here   than I wd with some relations!Miss Talbot who is the housekeeper is one of the easy   talkative kind & makes me think a little of Mary Sayne.    Only far Superior.  they are exceedingly informal & get up &   wait on table & clear the things away in what thee, Nat,   wld. call a very shocking manner, but they are perfect   ladies for all – hospitable & fond of society, & they seem   to have a great many pleasant frds.  Their one girl is not   the most efficient cook in the world but I have such a good   appetite that I get along very well, – I feel most as hungry   as when I get home frm. school as I remember I used to when   I was a scholar.  We have breakfast about 7 1/2 go to sch.   about 8 1/4.  it is only 10 min. walk — get home about 1.   pretty tired with the 4 hrs. standing & ready to lie down   till dinner time at 2 1/2.  After dinner we get dressed & go   out or see company.  We most always have one or two callers.   at 7 again we have tea & then get our work and sit in the   parlor, & wonder who is coming when the bell rings.  Miss   Field I like exceedingly.  She is a Presbyterian & a very   superior girl I shd. think so that in the matter of   companionship I need to have had fewer fears and   trepidations than I had
The school duties are not long   but pretty arduous while they last.  We have to stand nearly   all the time.  At least the model teachers do, but we   inferiors take the liberty of popping downoccasionally, but it is at the risk of [good] order for   there are so many in the room that unless you stand up to   it, & keep your eye on all 30 or 40 at once they are very   apt to get wrong in the back seats.  One of the first points   is to get [them] disciplined.  Mr Waterman the principal –   drills his class just as you wld. soldiers makes them fold   their arms put out one foot & finally stand up just as a   general wld. his troops, & when school is dismissed they   file out in quite an imposing manner.  That is to teach them   obedience I suppose, wh. is a great point gained.  They also   teach them a kind of gymnastic exercises by way of   recreation. as they have no place to play & consequently no   regular recess or almost none.  Mine is the next to the   smallest class. & only studys reading & spelling in words of   4 or 5 letters wh. is not very interesting.  I have’nt   discovered that there are any specially smart or Topsy like   ones among them.  We dont stop to talk or get acquainted   much but just keep them doing something or other the whole   time.  Upon the whole I enjoy the effect of the work very   much. & outside of that it is all very pleasant.
Jesse   has just called in a splendid barouche to ask for Miss F or   I to ride.  As I had’nt finished my letter & she had’nt been   out for sev. days I persuaded her to go.  Yesterday was the   first pleasant one we have had. since I have been here.  I   was so sorry I took my purple dress out.  It is just what I   want this cool weather for afternoons.  I want twice as many   clothes here as at home.  Caroline dont thee want to be   benevolent and cut me out a pair of those round cuffs like   thee made me for undersleeves.  Thee can work the button   holes, & have them starched & ironed.  I have a pair of   sleevesthat I can sew them on.  I wish if you shd. have any   opportunity you wld. send me my old blk silk body wh. hangs   in the back room closet.  Tammy Miller is going to P   tomorrow & out to Mary Morris’ so I told her to tell you   that she saw the school “mam”  Give my love to Cousin Frank   & Mary  Tell Cousin Mary I had the pleasure of seeing her   mother & I think her father yesterday.  Give my love to   Cous. Sarah & to Tom & Harry & to all Aunt Carolines & any   other enquiring frds.
I have written you a lengthy   epistle I hope there’ll be an exception in favor of mistakes   & bad writing as I have written lying on my back  I was so   very tired this morning that I was too lazy to sit up.  I do   not get much time to [sun] as my room is too cold to sit in   & they do not seem to bring their sewing into the parlor   much.  With much love

I   am going to send you a drawing of my house when I get time   so you can imagine how things are a little better.  I hope   Edgar will get the drafting business all settled,   satisfactorily

Dear Frank

Among the   many sins of omission & commission with which my Conscience   has been burdened of late – none has laid harder on my   stomach to speak in a physiological metap[h]or than my not   having answered [thine] epistle of – mo. – 1840.  This sheet   then intended as a peace offering and mediator for past   offences “by-gones” comes to thee by the hands of Geo. H.   Dunbar – (a young man of our religious denomination-   somewhat diligent attender of meeting – (where He in company   with the majority of our young men occupies the seat   fronting the women friends – pardon the digression but the   fact is worth recording that as the Mahometan prays with his   face towards Mecca – thou canst draw the parallel) not so   much distinguished as would be best for plainness of speech.   [behavi] and apparel – and inheriting with the rest of us   some failings I fear from Father Adam - ) who is to pass   thro Philada. on his way to Haverford and then to France in   a New Lock Haven packet next week. – A poet moreover and   somewhat unique personage. & can either roar like a lion or   a sucking dove at his pleasure – rhyme to the moon or swear   like a pirate. – I don’t know how long he stays in Philada.   but if you fall in with him you’ll know him.

The   greatest attraction in these parts this winter - & which   must take its share of the blame of having kept me from   attending to my Philada correspondence is a new periodical   entitled “L’Entreprise” which has originated among us and   has claimed a goodly portion of my leisure
The great   charm about you must know is that we have Lady contributors   – Gertrude Hussey “Murray” quondam –
with sundry & divers others – too tedious to mention as the   advertisements would say – with a respectable lot of   Quak[er] lady make considerable of a coterie. – 
Dr Hardy   undertook to join but whether he did not succeed [to] his   mind or whether his practice is too extensive & laborious to   admit of his wasting his time so idly I know not – but he   has not yet contributed – This much however must be said of   him whether through his intrinsic merits or accidental   circumstances he has in fact succeeded in getting into an   extraordinary practice and seems likely to settle down here   and live easy. – Ah!  Francis if I were only as goodlooking   a young man as thou art I should then think that Destiny had   cut me (too) out for a Doctor
Ben Hardy’s whiskers were   always irresistible – but a new bobwig which I find I had   the honor of bringing home from Philada. in one of those   boxes you remember – that new bobwig with the [portage] of   which I was so unconsciously honored – that new bobwig is   worth a thousand dollars a year to him – 

The old   gentleman that was at our house a little while since from   Salem – gave us a few particulars in Ben’s history that will   be useful to any one who shall hearafter have the honor of   compiling his biography – It seems that such was his   enterprise and such too his earnest zeal in the laudable   task of pleasing the women even in early life that after   having studied the art of Crispin in his nativevillage of Kennebunk he was at the pains of a journey and   long residence at Lyme to be initiated into the art &   mystery of making woman’s shoes

How instructive the   lesson that such heroism and model-gallantry teaches –   Frank! that mans life is a lesson to all posterity – Raised   very probably on a [shingle] in that bleak [-egion]   described so emphatically by the poet – 
“Away down East   dere
[Clow] [by] de moon”
then as he grew up from   [clouts] to petticoats from petticoats to breeches to trace   the ardent aspirations of a full soul. – panting after   greatness and distinction. – from the time he first drove a   peg to the time when he last [drove] a peg – still his   potentialities are visible [from] germ to perfection and   full maturity of cobblerhood. – Ah!  if I were only   good=looking enough!
One sin of commission too I must   confess & be shrived of – As I was turning over some old   papers of mine the other day – I accidentally opened an old   letter of thine containing “a Serenade” [which] being   forthwith tempted by the Devil I inserted in a forthcoming   no. of my periodical – Now I am of opinion that the   temptation proceeds from that source because unintentionally   I find I have eclipsed myself altogether I having “done the   poetry” in that [line] till now finding that I shall not be   able to write anything as good myself why “Othello’s   occupation gone”. – 
and I shall be obliged to cultivate a little taste & genius   which I flatter myself I possess [as] “dea[t]h is [shocking]   accident – and suicide Songster.” – By the way I have begun   a pastoral

“Jocund lambkins softly warble” which when   finished shall be forwarded for your criticism and another –   
[Thus] fair brow thoughts richest mine
When thy   bright as diamonds shine
Rivalled only by the glow
of   the bright orbs below – there’s a [touch] for you –   

Remember you dont pay any postage for this letter   
So it is no matter if it is not worth anything
very   sincerely yours

      My dear Mary
      
      Frank has been writing to William this morning, and has most likely advised you on all points of interest.- you probably know by this time, that we are all in a good state of health, and we hope that our sister Susan is improving, tho' she still has some head-ache.  Frank & cousin Wistar are very kind and devote themselves almost exclusively to contributing to her comfort & pleasure in every way.  F is devoted to Susan and does evey thing in his power to promote the improvement of her health, his kindness is unparalleled: everything is done for us, and we have nothing to do, but join in the pleasant plans laid out for us.- Elizy H & Susan were concluding before dinner, that they accomplished very little of any thing on account of the time occupied in changing their dresses for the different labors of the day.- About ten in the morning they prepare for bathing or rather we do when Susan does not go-
      /
      not arrive on 7th day tho' we intend to do so if possible.  the Boat did not leave until 5 o'clock this morning.  I expect the irregular lately.- with much love
      aff thy sister Anne
      Susan will accompany us to Hazard's this afternoon
      she is resting since her bath.then return about 12 o'clock.  rest, until time to away for dinner, then about 5 o'clock, a different costume must necessarily be adapted for Sailing especially when the boats, are slightly fishy & a little dirty.- then we come home about ten-time or little past, and another change must be made to appear at [---] which [---] will suffice for the evening.- but all this is done in a good hurry and I cannot say it consumes much time.- I believe I have nothing new to tell thee, and indeed, I expect it would be very puzzling to think of any such thing when Cousin Wistar is of the party, for he writes home to frequently, and describes every thing that seems with so much minuteness, that if you are favored with the perusal of his epistles, ours must seem quite commonplace; this is my conjecture, as we joke Wistar & Sue both, about writing so often.- Only to think- Sixth day evening we leave, if a storm or fog does not prevent us, and Tom has concluded to remain, and return with us last evening tho' fog was so dense that the Bay-State" did not go out, and now we have every prospect, of the same thick state of the atmosphere for this evening consequently.  it seemed hardly worth while for Tom to leave before we did.- The Massachusetts arrived here with Mr. Williams on board, about 11 o'clock thismorning having been lying off Point Judith, even since four o'clock.  Susan & Lizzie went to bathe this morning with F & Wistar leaving me at home to pass the time as I could.  Tom & Moses had gone fishing, and I was quiet enough.  Susan though it best notwithstanding your message, to try the [---] three times faithfully as the Dr directed, and I hope she will not be any worse for it, and perhaps it may strengthen her afterwards.  She says she likes it very much while in the water, but she feels pretty weak for sometime afterwards.  we think she is the best judge for what is best for her, and she does exactly what she wished in the Bathing line; Frank takes her in, giving her three waves as directed, he said the water was very warm & pleasant this morning.  I quite long to go in again but fear I shall not have an opportunity of going more than once or twice more before I leave.- It suits Elizy Hacker exactly, she feels a little tired after coming out, but it seems to brance & strenghthen her, and shee looks better I think in this little time of our [---] here.  I do hope her father will telegraph her to remain with Sue, if the letter does not arrive in time to answer it before our leave.- yester afternoon we were out Sailing in the bay, landed on one of the [dumpling?] rocks gathered some sprigs of green to press, and enjoyedthe novelty of it highly, it was really very pleasant, altho' by the time we returned, our blanket shawls were almost white with the fog.  Sailing seems to suit Susan, very well, but I think clear weather as a general thing is preferable to her.- This afternoon we think of calling at fr'd Hazard’s, we spent a pleasant evening there last Sixth day.  they are certainly a delightful family. Ann[a/e?] Hazard called here this morning with S & A Jenkins who are still staying with them – we intend riding out to see fr'd Jenkins before we go.- 4th day morn.  I was obliged to leave this shut hastily yesterday afternoon, as Thomas Hazard & his wife called upon us inviting us to spend this afternoon with them which we intend doing.  Elizy & Frank are much disappointed I believe in Fanny H’s beauty, but they must see her at [---] before they fully decide.  She is perfect at home.- my love to all- Susan and Lizzie are taking a nap before dinner, and I cannot disturb them now.- there is a thick fog over they bay now 12 at noon, and it will [---] increase- Tom could not have gone last night in consequence of the bay as the boat did not leave, and perhaps it is as well for him to wait for us.  Frank & myself do not think it proper to leave here in a fog or storm and Tom must not think it strange if we do

   Dear mother
   
   I wrote a few hasty lines to Frank this afternoon which brother Thomas did not succeed in sending to you, as the Germantown post-office he found was not open on First-day, giving you the good news that sister E. has another boy, a very fine-looking child, and the tenth grandson, but as yet without a name, which is not decided upon, indeed, I have not heard one suggestion, only it is to be a fancy name, and Lizzie leaves it to bro' Thomas select.  Sister E. desires her love, and wishes me to say to thee, that she is very comfortable, this evening; and the Doctor says she is doing as well as is possible.  The child was born at 1/2 past 7 o'clock this morning, and the nurse came about 9.  Thomas sent to town for her early, and she came as soon as shecould, but it did not make any difference as the Doctor thought Mary Sixsmith was entirely competent to attent to all that was needed, and she proved so.
   Bro’ Thomas took Harry, Tom & Willy to meeting, and afternoon left our two boys at father’s to dine, and went for them to return home towards evening.  The house seems quite lonely and deserted now, and company at the tea-table was very slim this evening, only three, Thomas, Harry & myself.
   Ellie Stokes with little Ellie left for Riverton yesterday afternoon.  Ellie ad been staying with us since 6th day morning.
   Sister Susan and Virginia also went home yesterday afternoon, they enjoyed their visit with us very much, and it was very pleasant to us to have them, as we miss you all so much.   The children have kept pretty well, tho' yesterday was an oppressively warm day here, so damp & close, but to day it is lovely, tho' quite warm.-
   I hope you are all enjoying the sea-breezes notwithstanding the hard beds, which must be quite a draw-back to thecomfort of some of you.  How is Anne?  Sister Lizzie wished me to mention, that she hopes Anne will drink plenty of [---] wine as it was particularly recommended to Clemmie by Dr. [Meigs?], at one time as being very beneficial, as it has the peculiar quality of enriching the blood, and he ordered her to take a tumbler full a day.  Lizzie thinks Frank had better take some more of it to Atlantic City for her on 4th day, when he comes up.  Please give my love to her, also to father, Emma, and sister Lizzie Brown.  Dr Rhoads mentioned this morning that Margaret Eliz expected to go to the sea-shore tomorrow in company with Augustus Wilson, and some one else whose name I did not quite understand.  I hope you may meet with her.-   
   affectionately thy daughter

   Dear Alexis,
   
   We recd thy letter of Jan. 16th a few days since, & have been thinking over thy proposition.  It wd. be nice to be able to spend part of our summers in Susquehanna Co particularly if you make it your home, but we have not been looking forwarrd to keeping house in our return.  I do not want to live at Connymead again, (indeed I do not think any of us want to; unless we cd. find some one to live with us)  It was too lonely, particularly for me.  & if we did not keep house there in winter, we cd. not keep very well keep house in summer.  How or where we shall live when we go home, I do not know.  Indeed the uncertainties of the future, & what it will be best to do, often weighs upon my mind.  Connymead is no placefor any body to live who wants to be a Friend, or who has any preference for their ways.  Life there was a continual struggle wh. I have no desire to renew, & perhaps we shall never know again [ever/even?] that semblance of a home.  I hope if thee and Lily picked to bring your children up as Friends, you may be able to keep them in a community where Friends live.  For it is pretty hard for a young person who has been uninstructed in what are considered the accomplishments of life to have to live where these are considered all important, & are the chief recupations of those by whom you are surrounded.  It requires a good deal of strength of character to be able to live alone, I [---], & Friends must always do it more or less when they go out from among their own people.  When one has not been brought to play on the piano or sing or draw, or paint, or evento play cards- a not very valuable accomplishment certainly- & yet one in wh. English people who are both intelligent & sensible, seem to while away at least a fourth part of their waking hours; & never to tire of- When I say, one has never been instructed in any of these things, one feels as if one ought to be at least where they are not the chief employment of life.  Of course when living in a delightful pension on the Riviera- one is not supposed to be exactly fulfilling the normal conditions of existence- Existence here (the physical part of it) seems too delightful to be long continued, & I have wonder since we have been here how long 14 human beings could live together, without apparently a shadow of sorrow or anxiety to disturb the delightful days, which seem, to glide away without a cloud either inward or outward, to mar their peacefulness such skies, & such weather , & such walks as we have- only one littleshower in all the two months we have been here- It is the most perfect thing in weather certainly, that we have ever experienced.  If we had come last winter we shd  not have had the same experience of it, for it rained very much even here.  But I have digressed widely from the subject upon wh. I intended to write, [---] the old house of Woodbourne.  Whatever may be my inclincation with regard to it, (& I certainly shd. like very much the idea of being able to live somewhere near you).  I do not thonk C & A have any desire to undertake housekeeping there.  The life of a travelling artist- or even of the traveller, minus the artist- in these delightful regions & pensions where have all the comforts of home without its cares, does not intend to inspire you with a desire to renew the contest with the [biddy?]- in art less America. If only some plan cd. be devised by wh. Woodbourne cd. be converted into a pension.  I have no doubt we shd. spend a good deal of our time there, & shd. think the old house wd. need an immense amount of repairing, & as to the old chairs of the Conklin family, I feel as if I had lost my interest in them & I shd. not think they wd. be worth the sum they mentioned.  It is provoking to have to buy what is your own.  (see 4th page of A's letter)Can thee tell us who paid the drivers on our Naples [---] wh. were packed in the same box with P.C.G.'s- we asked thee to do it & I suppose thee must have- but we have never heard.If not paid
   
   Please pay to the order of Francis C. Haines (who may be too modest to speak of it) 9 francs 15 centimes, as near as you can come at it.

March. 21. 1880.
   
   My dear Lily, Behold us in Rome once more!- dear delightful bewitching Rome- The city of cities- I cannot tell with what delight I find myself again threading its labyrinths & wandering amidst its ruins.  We reached here the 6th of March, having left Mentone 2 days before, passing one night in Genoa & thence by the midnight train to Rome.  This being the only train (owing to their very insane & uncomfortable arrangements) wh. gets you here at a respectable hour.  It was a very uncomfortable journey- but then we were coming to- Rome!!  We made a sojourn of two weeks only, at Dr. Müllers- Mentone we thought lovely- Dr M’s house not altogether so.  It is not happily [---] being at the end of one of thos dried up rivers, down wh. torrents of cold airrushed from the mountains.  We thought it much colder & damper than either Cannes or Nice.  & then there was a slight suggestion of boarding school about the household arrangements- & most for much open warfare between the Dr & his spouse to be altogether agreeable.  It is a great pity they have not learned to control their tempers a little in the presence of their guests at least- for at times it was rather to peppery to be pleasant.  Fortunately the storms seemed to be not very lasting.  & they were generally jolly enough- & in fact much more jolly then most people would be who were at their wits ends to make two ends meet.  A lady who was staying there with her family (pretty much as a matter of charity I fancy) told me they were over head & ears in debt & that she had come to the conclusion there was no use in trying to help them, as they never cd. keep any money- altho' they ask a very high price for their accomodations.  The excursions at Mentone were truly lovely, & the Dr. was alwaysready to take us.  In fact we thought he quite preferred the ladies to the boys for he seemed quite put out once or twice at our declining to go.  but they were too hard for me, & I did none of the very long ones.  I shd. think however for those who were up to that sort of thing, Mentone would be one of the most delightful of the Riviera towns, tho' each one of them seems to have its own peculiar charms.  The weather was very warm when we got to Rome, & took the back bone out of me terribly- It however soon changed from mild, to cool, clear & bracing & the last 10 days have been delicious- I never was able to do so much walking in Rome before, & on spring afternoons such as these what luxury cd. be greater than to drive or to wander at will among the ruins all golden in the light of the declining sun- or to watch the funny old models in their gay rags & tatters- (wh. seem to [---] the spirit of the twins-) hanging themselves out on the Spanish Steps to be admiredwith all the rest.  Surely there is no place on earth like Rome.  Last first day was the kings birthday & there was a grand review- & the king & queen & the [---] kindly [---] themselves , to our admiring gaze in the Borghese. It was quite too gay & disappointing to be proper for 1st day.  The usual ceremonies of holy week begin to day, wh. is Palm Sunday.  We did not attend at S. Peters, thinking last year it was rather a sell.  I went to the little Italian [Waldensian] Church, a great contrast indeed to the pomp & [---] of the great Cathedral.  We had got back to our old Hotel della Pace, where we were twice last winter.  We went first to another but did not like it, & so came here, where we found some friends of last summer (the Müllers).  It is a good central situation.  We look down upon the Piazza Barberinni & the old Tritan who is always blowing his stream of water into the air, & then catching it again all over his head & back wh. must be pretty well washed in all the years that it has been trickling over him.  Then on the other side of the street2
   
   is the Barberrini Pal.  & sad eyed Beatrice.  By way of variety the other day we went to one of Miss Brewsters receptions.  It was a kind of afternoon tea fight, of [---] & other distinguished persons like ourselves.  Tea, wine, & talk & many beautiful things to look at.   

   Next, we want to go with her.  Forbes the archaeologist to hear tge Forum explained on the latest authorities.  His explanations one said to be intensely interesting.  In fact Rome is so dissipating- there is such an infinity to see & to read & to learn that it is most distracting.  I hope we shall be here three or four weeks longer at least.  In fact it spoils you so for every thing else that it does’nt seem worth while to go any where afterwards.
   
   I ought to have told thee before, how glad I was to get thine & Agnes' letter at Mentone.  I was greatly struck with the advance of the latter's ideas since her first epistle wh. I have carried ever since, in the pocket of my satchel& wh. was composed mostly of kisses.  I see she is now advancing to the doll & the baby house interests of the little girl-hood.  The way the ideas were put together was very amusing- & the circumstantial acct. of the flight of the nurses & the changing reigns of the lady’s of the nursery very graphic.  Give her a kiss, & tell her Auntie has very much obliged for her letter & thought it very interesting.  Also that she must’not cut any more holes in her apron with her little scissors, but must make some nice little paper dresses for the paper dollys that Aunty sent in the letter.   

   22nd.  Just returned from our excursion to the Forum with Mr Forbes- two hours rummage amoung the ruins- intensely interesting- back nearly broken- head ditto.  General conglomeration of podiums, Tabulariums, demolished temples & roman emperors- but quite worth the 4 francs wh. is the price per head at wh. Mr F. deals out his information.  He has been on the spot for some years & actually seen & superintended the excavations- so of course knows a great deal about it, & sees it in a very interesting way- much more so than [Hare?], who is a dreadfully guide booky old fellow I think- Am too tired to write more   

   Please tell Alexis that the letters of credit came a few days since, & we are much obliged for his attention to them.  Love to all.  Tell Cousin Anna I am going yo ans. her letter as soon as I can find time.  Thy affectionate Sister

Title: 1880 July 11, Geneva, to Alexis

Geneva, July 11, 1880
   
   Dear Alexis,
   
   I want to ask thee a question.  Is it necessary in order to effect a division of our property (I mean such a division as shall give thee thy portion at Connymead) is it necessary that I return to America in the Autumn with C & A, as it has been our intention to do, (or at least theirs)?  For myself I have not entirely decided, tho' we have partly paid our passages for the 6th Nov. in the steamer "Illinois", on condition that we can change if it seems best to another vessel of the line.  It is late to sail, but there seemed to be no good steamer between the first week of October& the last, & as there will be no moonlight the last of October we thought it wd. be best to wait until the next moon.   

   There are many reasons why I shd. like to return in the Autumn, but the prospect of boarding in Phila is not very attractive, & of keeping house at Connymead still less so- indeed I shd. never be willing to undertake the latter again unless circumstances were very much changed.  C & A prefer the former.  If they were willing to keep house or even to board near Germantown, where we could have the enjoyment of the children, I shd. come home with the greatest pleasure.   

   But this I expect they will never wish to do.  So that until I can think of some way for me to live in that part of the world.  It seems as if I might almost as well stay here- for boardingin Phila wd. not be much better as far as you are concerned.   

   The thought of staying by myself seems a little dismal, but I cd. stay very well in the family where we now are & be as well cared for as I cd. expect or wish to by, by strangers.  Then there is an elderly lady (whom we have met several times (& I think have spoken of) Miss Wetherill, Jno. Price Wetherills dhr, of Phila) who has asked me to join her party, consisting of her niece & [Pebers?] of Phila.  We were with them 8 weeks in Rome & found them very pleasant.  So I could stay very well if I wanted to- Tell me how the idea strikes you, with regard to the business- as, if my presence is necessary to the accomplishment of it, that wd. decide the question.   

   We still continue in Geneva & still continue to like exceedingly our french family.  We intended in coming, to stay a month & then go to the Mts.  But the weather has been almost too cool for anygreat heights, & this, so far (I dont know how it may be in August) seems a happy medium.  We have had a few warmish days, but for the most part it has been a delightful summer climate.  Then too we have had so much gadding about, that we enjoy the quiet & the thought that we are learning something.   

   How often I wish I cd. have Agnes here for a few months.  It would do for her, what years of study at home cannot do for any body.  I never knew before how badly, or rather how little we had been taught at home, how to pronounce french.  Then too this is such a nice family where it wd. be so safe to place a child.  Their ideas about education are good- & they have so much simplicity in their ways & manners- they seem almost like those of friends.  The children have never been allowed to go to the opera or the theater- tho' they have one, within a few doors of them.  Every evening before going to bed, we have a little "culbe"- Madam Duproix reads out of a big bible- & then makes a little extemporaneous prayer- so very simple, that one cannot help but feel as if it came from the heart; After this, we separate for the night with much hand-shaking and many "[---]" & "[---]" & "[---]" &c- The great objection to the french is that they have to say so much about every little thing & are really too polite for comfort.  I think each person at the table says "par-r-r-don"- about 50 times at each meal (with a very great trill to the r- & a very great accent on the last syllable) if all this wasn't accompanied with real kindness of heart (as in this case) one wd. become "very fatigued" of it.   

   We suppose that you are now at Montrose tho' we dont know it.  It has been a perfect age since anyone has written from Awbury.  I sent cous. FRC a letter containing a cheque about5 weeks since & having rec'd no acknowledgement fear it has been confiscated, or that he is not well.  We are anxious to hear how you perform'd the journey & how Montrose goes.  Netty is writing to Lilly as I will not write now 
   
   with much love to her & the children

Haverford 4 mo 20 1865
   
   My dear Cousin Clemmy
   
   My thoughts have been with thee at various times since thy departure from our neighborhood, and I have been inclined to reproach myself for not having written;- but perhaps it is well enough, for there is no telling what effect in one way, things said out of season, may have, more than what may result in the other direction from things said in season.  Much conversation on religious matters thee will agree with me, is under some circumstances disadvantagious; as when deeds, acts, and strivings are the more needful thing.   

   The great purpose and Love of Christ have been much in my mind in remembering a former time of bitterness and grief, and how he wiped away such tears frommy eyes though he opened their fountains again for gratitude and joy: and how new roles and a new strength were granted me.  And to attain this what is not worthy to be passed through? and what suffered and endured?  Truly "men ought always to pray and not to faint" "Be thou fruitful and I will give thee a crown of life."  and how little worthy we are of it ever then.  We know how that "this brief suffering which [---] but for a moment, worked for us a far more eternal might of glory."  How the business of life tends to wear off the strong gratitude and love which a little view of the glory and goodness of our Maker causes to swell and burn in their heart; and how as it grows dimmer, and we further from the shadow of his wing [---]  words and hard judgements creepin.  But can any forget that "with what judgement ye judge ye shall be judged".  But we must continually return to the fountain head, if perhaps He will again bless us, and "cause our heart to burn within us", how low do we then sink, in the light of glory [---], and immesurable greatness.  In such a state of mind are we fit to do out duty with pleasure, and find ourselves still unprofitable servants, with rejoicing, for "Grant what thou wilt, without thee I am poor, but with thee I am rich, take what thou wilt away."  What this duty is, is the real difficulty, this is the fight to test the shield of faith, and the preparation of the Gospel of Peace.May we both bear it well, doing the work- or some work, well & not beating the air.  But this and many other weak things/5/22 Lilly was married last 5th day.  I was second groomsman with Martha Garrett.  All passed off very pleasantly.  The meeting was uncommonly favored: I have not often when in so undeserving a state (but we are that at all times) had such a heart-opening granted, and the ministers were favored with true fervency and spoke very encouragingly and usefully to the pair just married, and to the others.  Samuel Emlen made a prayer which I have seldom heard excelled in strength of feeling.   

   Thy letter thro' Alexis was very acceptable.  I hope thee may feel thy reward either in connection with or independent of results.  If thee feels dull about it sometimes- thee will remember that all men do that.  I certainly do when I look at results (which I needn't do if I do mybest).
   
   The committee of managers are putting a house in order for me here.  Perhaps thee remembers a small establishment by the Rail Road where Joseph Harlan formerly lived.  With a few alterations it will be a very nice home.  The breast of the pond where the front lane passes will probably be strengthened, and the water backed nearer the Rail R. so as to make a very pretty sheet.  I will not forget to send thee an invitation in time.  Does thee want anything in the book line,- or other kind of assistance?  I would like to hear more of thy school and its working.
   
   Believe me thy
   affectionate cousin

   Thee will probably be somewhat surprised in receiving a communication from me, in reply to thine- but I have determined notwithstanding my extreme diffidence to employ pen & paper- in order- if possible to dispel some unpleasant and I may ass unhappy associations connected with thy last visit.  That I did feel and evince some repugnance to having a private conversation with thee- I freely acknowledge.  Why I did so- it is impossible for me to explain- unless it was because I supposed the one- we had previously had- was sufficient to elucidate all difficulties- and therefore a second one useless.- I regret now such a thought should have entered my mind- and why I felt it painful- to have a further explanation- when I saw it wd. afford thee a satisfaction- is a mystery I do not yet understand; but as all regrets are unavailing- I will not strengthen them by indulging in, or dwelling upon them.-  That my manners may have appeared in some instances- as they says, cold and repulsive, I am sensible- without my intending them to have that effect, at any rate- let me assure thee, it was very far from my intention, to wound or hurt thy feelings for even as I wd. like my own respected- have I endeavoured to consider thine.------ I certainly meant to imply from what I said- I considered thee in fault, in not having sent me any intimation of thy feelings with resepct to me, throughout the whole seven months of thy absense; most assuredly- absense & silence were never calculated to cherish and increase a preference, which under different- and more auspicious circumstances might have arisen; & as thee gave me no intimation I was not forgotten- I had no alternative left, but to believe as I did- thee had abandoned all idea of further intercourse- well then- considering myself slighted, and neglected, how could reserve and coldness of manner be entirely avoided?  In extending my forgiveness, I really thought I had something to forgive- but it seems- according to the light in which thee views it- there was no fault committed- and consequenlty no "need of forgiveness."  However different thy views of human nature- and the ways of the world, are from my own- I must still see those actions- in the light of errors- but will consider them as unintentional- and arising from inexperience.  With respect to our correspondence motives of delicacy alone- prevented me from consenting to it- If thee had thought correctly about it- theewd. have supposed, as our friendship & intimacy advanced those feelings- wd. have been overcome- and however great an effort I still think it wd. be- to maintain a correspondence with a gentleman even after an engagement, I should consider it a duty- an obligation, not to be dispensed with.-  I do not remember thy suggesting any other mode of intercourse between us- than the one just spoken of- at all events neither of those mentioned by thee- wd. have been very suitable, or meet with my concurrence.  I acquit myself- if thee will not do it- of all design at "flirtation & coquetry," however some of my sex may indulge in it at the expense of yours- I am very sure- I do not belong to that class of cruel coquettes- who make a boast of their conquests- & offer encouragement where none is meant.  In writing this letter- I trust I am not guilt of an improper act- I thought considering all things- it was nothing more than thy due- & in doing it- my mind which was before ill at ease- is put comparatively at rest.-  I beg thee will destroy this letter- and forget anything but friendship ever passed between us.-  I have now only to add an assurance of respect & esteem & how earnestly I wish thy happiness, thee can never know, unless thee can read the heart of thy sincere friend

   Having an opp'y of writing, I will embrace it if it be only to thank thee for thy kind attention to the subjects mentioned in thine of 22 ult.-  ye mildness of ye season so far, will probably favor the operations of the Ches. & Del. Canal Co.-  I hope the Algonquin may do well at Savannah, as I observe by late a/cts, that no vessels were up there, & freights were brisk, tho' ye rates were low.  if it be not improper, nor too much trouble, please mention in writing to me, ye names of ye authors of any of the essays in "the Friend," that may come to thy knowledge.-  we have lately had a visit in these parts, from two hetorodox friends, Jno. Foulke of Quakertown, Bucks Co., & Salathiel Cleaver, of Montgomery Co.-  they had meetings at Friendsville, & in the neighborhood.  the Presbyterians expressedtheir satisfaction with the communications of J. Foulke.  I did not hear him speak in public, but understand that he did not speak on doctrinal points.  he is a man of venerable appearance, & his plain, communicative, unostentatious habits & manners, are calculated to preposess a stranger in his favour.  amongst other places, that he has visited, is ye settlement of the German Separatists in the Western country.  he speaks of their condition as very comfortable & flourishing.  the canal which is to connect the Lakes with the Ohio, passes thro' their land.
   
   I have just rec'd a letter from Caroline.  please give my love to her & tell her, that I will thank her to use my authority in contradicting any rumours of the kind to which she alludes.-  we are obliged to submit to the mortification of being ye subjects of them, but I think it is no more improper to contradict such, than any other incorrect reports.

We have lately been favoured also with a visit from Joel Woolman and Alvin Keyser, appointed by Abington Quarterly Meeting to visit Friendsville Preparative Meeting. they appeared to be man of plain, unassuming humble manners, and were well received by both Hicksites & Orthodox. Cha's Shoemaker accompanied them as far as a Stroudsburg, where he became so ill, as to present his proceeding further. We have subsequently had a visit from Ja's Bell, another orthodox friend and an elder, appointed by Stroudsburg Monthly Meeting.
    
    Dan'l Stroud has been indisposed, or he also wd. probably have visited this part of his flock.  he occasionally writes excellent letters of advice to afford thee an idea of his decisive and at the same time affectionate letters of language & manner, I will give thee an extract from one of them, recently addressed to E. Walker: "distressing as is ye fact, yet it certainly is the case, that the Hicksites are a distinct Society from Friends, and ye separation proceeded from ye leaders of that seccession having become corrupted with anti-christian doctrines, mostly Socinian, but compounded with some other speculative notions, made up into bills to suit ye subjects to whom they were to be administered, and gilt with specious professions of great spirituality, to captivate members and professors with Friends. this with various practices, such as are too commonly used in electioneering, have beguiled & seduced many, who have not or had not previously embraced those awfully dreadful notions, not fitting to be styled doctrines, when we are speaking of religion, and whether these will become leavened into the mass of infidelity with their leaders, or separate from them remains among the things which futurity must disclose. that thou & I, and ye dear children Providentially entrusted to our care, may be preserved from this direful contagion, I have earnestly craved, feeling some hope, that we may resist every temptation that may beset us, to unsettle us and loss about with every wind of doctrine.
    
   If we ever knew anything, "as we ought to know", le us "walk by ye same rule and mind the same thing." Let us be satisfied with and established in "the faith once delivered to ye saints",and say with ye apostle, "thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift", in uniting Deity & virility so as to provide salvation for our fallen race, consistently with divine justine & mercy, though the august plan & means were such as Angels desired to look into.  and tho' this wonderful union is beyond their conception & ours also, we shd. be grateful for it, for surely it is exactly adapted to the condition & need of us poor frail beings, inasmuch as it is complete, or affords complete salvation, both indemnity & cure. Redemption from the penalty & power of sin; remdemption from the penalty by the atonement made by Jesus Christ, our Lord, being God & man;- and redemption from ye power or government of sin by the Holy Spirit, so received into & operating upon our hearts, as to change them, producing a birth of ye spirit & furnishing divine ability in faithful humility & obedience, to resist temptation & be preserved in divine acceptance."++++- Present my very warm & cordial love to thy very dear children, who I feel expressibly near to me. I remember ye kindness of R. T. also; and entertain sentiments of regard for our dear yound friend W. D. Cope, your near neighbour. under sensations which I am thankful for, I bid you all affectionately fare well." (signed) Daniel Stroud.-
   
   Thy observations with regard to ye precarious tenure of our hold on life, are worthy of being often recalled, & deeply impressed upon ye memory & ye heart.- with thyself, I hope & trust that ye deep concern & unbounded affection of our dear deceased Mother for us, will not have been uttered & felt in vain;- that ye expression of her hopes & fears, her sighs & sorrows, have not been for naught.-  I sincerely desire that ye change in ye management of your business, may be advantageous in a pecuniary point of view to thyself & Alfred, but ye annunciation of it, caused a shade of sorrow to pass over my heart. ye expunging of a name, upon which we have been in ye habit of looking so long, that we look upon it with a degree of veneration, seems somewhat like ye disappearance of an old friend or favourite.
   
   I have had workmen pretty constantly employed at my building since my last return from ye City, sometimes to ye number of 6 or 8, sometimes more. ye attention which these, my farm & Father's estate, occupies my time, pretty fully. ye last mentioned concern requires in its present stage & condition much attention for but little profit. but it is absolutely necessary that something shd. be done to guard against ye effects to which it is liable from an accumulation of taxes & interest. I still look forward however, to a change, decidedly for ye better, but we are so apt to be too fast in our calculations, that it becomes us to be cautious.-  I think it likely from present appearances, that my investment in ye stock of ye Leigh Coal and Navigation Co, will be a good one. I am not displeased to find myself becoming more & more interested in my farm. I form an attachment for every tree & every field, which has called forth my care & attention,- for every hill and every valley, that have afforded me gratification by their smiles & beauties.  ye lover of ye country can often realize ye enthusiasm of [Hervey], & exclaim, "when the little hills rejoice & the vallies laugh & sing, who can forbear joining ye general joy". I have at all events reason for self gratulation, inasmuch as I am more pleased with my present mode of life, than I at one time ever expected to be.- I early perceived that with my limited means, I mustbe contented with advancing slowly, in any improvements that I might wish to make, but it has been very difficult to reconcile myself to making so little progress as yet been able to make, owing to ye circumstance last mentioned as well as others.-  I expect that ye capital & influence that Caleb Carmalt is employing in favour of this County, will be of advantage to it, though we we may not feel their effects immediately in this neighbourhood.  some of E. Walker's Family, who have recently been at Friendsville, mention, that he has 30 men & 9 yoke of oxen at work on his farm.  two of his brothers, & one of his sisters have also pitched their tents at Friendsville.-  his brother James, fm Philada., has purchased a farm of 1000 acres & is employed in improving it.-
   
   With particular love to all, I remain thy affectionate brother,

I hardly expect that there will be any divd. this year, on ye Lehigh Canal stock, but if there should be, I will be obliged by thy informing me of it.-  in addition to the drafts referred to by thee, I passed one to C.

Woodbourne, 5 month 15th 1830
   Dear Brother:
   
   Thy acceptable letter of 7th inst.  has been rec'd.  thy observations with regard to retirement & the Christian's duty, are certainly correct in the abstract, but I think it will be readily admitted by thee on reflection, that remotely placed as thou art from ye scene in which I move, a correct opinion of ye course most proper for me to pursue, cannot easily be formulated, either by thyself, or any one similarly situated.  to be candid; I may mention, that I think myself pretty fortunate in being able by some excersize or display of management, to make a live,- to use a significant term of the Yankees here,- to possess or enjoy ye common comforts of life.  I have therefore, not much time or inducement to propound to myself sentimental or metaphysical queries in regard to duties, problematical, or supposed to be omitted.  I may be compared in some measure to an honest & benevolent day labourer. (not insinuating that I have a claim to ye character of benevolence.)-  if a distressed fellow creature cross his path or approach his cabin, no one is more willing to dispense ye comforts with which he may be blessed.  but he cannot, like his more wealthy & independent fellow-citizens, go in quest of objects of charity.-  ye call of benevolence, shd. be heard & obeyed, and I freely acknowledge that it ought to be our aim, so to arrange our temporal concerns, as to be in the way of receiving benefit & advantage from our fellow men, or of administering ye same to them, as opportunities present.  this view & reflection, I wish to bring home to myself.  but I have undertaken a business & entered upon a course of life which I had but little previous knowledge, for which I had but little previous education & of which I had formed erroneous expectations.  it wd. certainly have been better on some accounts, if I had taken up my abode in a town or village, upon my first making this county my residence.  if I had excluded farming & building from my views, my business wd. have been much simplified.  but I wished to select ye most adventageous situation for promoting the interest & settlement of Father's est'e: and I think by showing that I consider ye land and ye country good enough for myself, a favorable effect has been & will continueto be produced.  ye difficulty of obtaining assistance here, is a great drawback to ye comfort & satisfaction of ye farmer.  yet as I have put ye machine in motion, I must keep it moving, & as I am harnessed in, I must move with it, unless I have some one to supply my place.  I still indulge ye hope that I shall be able to pull things into proper train, but I begin to think that it will require about as many years to accomplish ye object, as I supposed it would of weeks, before commencing ye undertaking.  I am often however enabled, gratefully to call to mind ye advantage of my present situation, to that of remaining in the City, a victim to disease.  tho' I am thankful that my circumstances are what they are, I trust I shall have sense enough to keep in view that I am not a man of fortune, in ye sense that ye term is generally understood; and when I see how easily my income & more than my income, is fittered away, and how little is to be seen of its effects, I am induced to pause, before launching out into expensesm without calculation.  when & how, ye returns are to come, is uncertain.  a farm in a new county is indeed a quicksand, so great are its absorbing qualities; & we have to deal here with a shewd set of sharpers.  a man who is considered to be in tolerably good circumstances, & is supposed to have money, must expect to be asked two prices for everything, & they will be Jewed or Yankeed out of him, if he does not look about him with eagle eyes.-  Dr. Rose, to be sure, in ye course of upwards of twenty years has done much: but ye course pursued by one man, does not form a rule for another, differently circumstanced.  he has had a numerous class of settlers, of diversified trades & occupations to assist him, to whom he has sold land for good prices, & from many of whom he wd. probably have obtained nothing, had he not have taken pay in such kind of assistance.-  Caleb Carmalt is similarly situated.-  speaking of Caleb, reminds me of a circumstance which occurred at the last Friendsville Preparative Meeting.  he was present, and John Kite, the clerk, objected to proceeding with ye business, whilst one who was not a member of the Society, was in ye house.  Caleb said that he supposed he was ye person alluded to, but that he had proof of his being a member of the Society of Friends, which he cd. produce if necessary.  one of the Hicksites remarked, that ye meeting itself had no information, or at least no official information of C. Carmalt's disownment.  a number of remarks were made in bothsides, but there seemed to be a general sentimentin favour of proceeding with what was before the meeting, without further discussion or excitement, and the clerk accordingly complied with what seemed to be the wish of the meeting.-  this is about ye substance of an account given by a Hicksite to E. Walker.-  what I mentioned in ye preceding part of my letter with regard to charity & benevolence, also recalls to recollection ye case of Uniah Estes, one of Father's settlers, who for ye last 6 weeks or 2 months, has been afflicted with mental alienation.  Jno. Mann kept him at his house several weeks.  by judicious management there, he has been so far resolved, that it was considered safe to suffer him to return to his family.  if he shd. have a relapse which is feared, it is tho't that it wd. be advisable to send him to Friends' Assylum.  if ye information is in thy possession or can be conveniently obtained by thee, I will thank thee to mention in thy next, ye lowest term on which poor patients are rec'd into that institution.  he is a member of the Society of Friends & belongs to a monthly meeting in ye State of New York.-  Elias Bennet, an old & respectable settler on ye Susqa. Co. Tract, who, Father will probably recollect was grievously afflicted with a cancer, died in ye early part of this Spring.  he has bequeathed his farm, or his right in it, to two of his sons.-  my annual subscription in advance, to "the Friend," became due in ye early part of this month.  I will be obliged by thy having it paid when convenient, & having a rec't taken.-  please not to forget my subscription to the Athenaeum.  I wish I were well rid of my share of stock.  I did not intend to have omitted to mention, that there was no charge in my a/c with the old firm of Thomas P Cope & Sons, for my proportion of ye amo't of subscription to the "Morning Journal."  it would I think be no more than right that I shd. pay part of it.-  I shall be anxious relative to Sister Caroline, & will be obliged by thy giving me information relative to her state of health, as soon as convenient.
   
   With love to all, I remain affectionately thy Brother,

Woodbourne 7mo. 29th 1830
   Dear Brother:
   
   The idea presented in thine of ye 20 inst. of finding me out in the woods, I may truly say, excited in me very pleasant feelings; tho' at ye same time, I feel as if I can scarcely dare to invite you, for reasons that I think it wd. not be proper to mention in a letter. I will give thee a remote exception of what amongst other things, I allude to, by refering to a frequent remark, that in every flock, there is a black sheep, & a Judas in every community. more than this, I ought not to say. I believe I have never hesitated to answer any query put to me by relatives & friends respecting my situation, nor have I any objections to doing so, unless I may have a very particular reason for secrecy. but Marmaduke will perhaps from having been an impartial spectator, be more likely to give thee a satisfactory description of Woodbourne than myself.- E. Walker bro't me thy letter whilst I was spending ye evening as usual, with his family. I mentioned what was said by thee about visiting me. George desired me to tell thee that they shd. be very glad to see thee: and Priscilla said, tell him to bring Rachel &Martha. they all seemed to be as glad to see Marmaduke & our other cousins, as if they had been their own relations. it seemed to me to be quite like an era in ye history of Woodbourne, when my City relations had actually paid me a visit.- I think you had better come on, and take us by surprise as they did, and thus give us no time to think about any obstructions, objections, or difficulties. with regard to any pecuniary considerations, I think I cd. fully satisfy my neighbours, tho' they will not listen to any direct proposition relative to consideration money.- in expressing what precedes, I have used ye freedom, which ought to exist in ye intercourse between brothers. to one, who does not stand in ye same relationship to me as thyself, I wd. have felt some hesitation in saying what I have said to thee.- I was much interested in reading thy description of ye proposed institution for imparting instruction in ye higher branches of learning to the children of Friends, and had no idea that so great an advance had been made towards affecting ye object in view. it is a noble undertaking, & if accomplished, will tend to increase ye reputation of the Society. the sup-position or opinion, that our profession, principles or religion acquires ye discouragement of literary knowledge & intelligence, appears to me pretty evidently to be a mistake.-  I was fearful that there wd. be an appearance of ambiguity in my observations with regard to the Union Canal stock.  In my last communication on ye subject, I expressed a willingness to invest, if I cd. obtain five per cent on the am't invested.  this I shd. receive, were I to give $240 per share, or 120 per cent.  consequently, if I am right in my estimate, ye price is still below my limits.  but of course, there would be no advantage in offering a high price, if there is none of the stock for sale.-  I am much obliged to thy attention to the subject.  supposing that the Bank of Penna has declared ye dame divd. for ye last as for ye previous half year, I inclose a Power of Att'y for its collection, & one also for the interest on the C & D Canal loan.  if the Lehigh Co. shd. have disclosed a divd. please inform me.  I see by the news-papers, that 3 1/2% has been declared by the U.S. B'k.

   I may say the worst that I have for years   I have had a dreadfully bad cold, and though I think it would have done me good to see thee, I must now bid all hail! to Susquehanna County, and did not feel much inclined to go into company nor was I in a very suitable condition for so doing.  I hasten to the country of cloud-capped eminences, invigorating breezes, placid lakes, ever-varying surface and romantic scenery.-  there to feel myself reinstated in the occupation which is the height of my ambition, that of an independent farmer.-  an occupation for which I do not think my partiality as yet has diminished.  "Ye generous yeomen, [---] the plough"!  before taking my flight, I wish to let thee know that I did not forget the subject of "Friendship’s Offering" relative to which we had some conversation during our last rural walk.  the reason for my not sending the said work, I will give when I again see thee.  this seems to be a small matter to [---] to, but I think it best thus to do it, as I have never yet forfeited my word or violated an engagement, and I do not wish to give any cause for so however slight for supposing that I wd. do so.  if thee gets married to any one, while I am gone, be sure that it is to a clever fellow.  I am still somewhat inclined I should like to have had one sweet kiss of thy pretty mouth, before, peradventure, I should forever be [---] the opportunity (5); however thee knows we ought to learn to submitto submit with fortitude to our fate.  I am still somewhat inclinded to the opinion, which I have before hinted to thee, that I am not well qualified to undergo the ordeal of a systematic courtship, such as is frequently, perhaps generally expected & practiced in this part of the world.  if I ever succeed in making a capture of that fair citadel, or seat of love,- a lady’s heart; it must, I apprehend be by storm, rather than by gradual approaches, long trains, dexterous manouvers, or a regular siege.
   
   I have now only to say,
   "Adieu! a heartfelt warm adieu"! from thy still affectionate friend,
   
   if thou wilt only be persuaded, dear Susan, a drab bonnet, I will on my part agree to shade my face with a broad-brim.  if we do not then attract universal admiration, who will be so bold as to say that we will not at least command general respect.
   
   I have received a notice requiring my immediate departure from the City, if possible, in order to attend the next Court to be held at Montrose.  excuse haste and all the nonsense contained in these lines.-I expect to have the agreeable company of my Cousin Rebecca Drinker as far as [Stoddartsville].  being of a cheerful disposition, I expect she will prevent my spirits from flagging.To S,

   Dear Alg-
   
   Words are so hopelessly futile and especially are they so when cold on the paper that I hesitate to make the attempt to express the very deep feelings that the recent news inspired in me.  Our meetings together during the past year had had the effect of developing in me desires for development and usefulness as thosewhich most manifestly animated him and especially during the past few months I had looked forward to a future where we might work for the common object of developing in ourselves and thence to our meeting and Society a deeper truer life.  And so it comes that I feel as though I might to at least make the attempt to tell you all how deep is my sense ofof personal loss and there fore how sincerely I sympathize with thee and the rest of his family in the loss of him from your circle.
   
   I know of no one person who, of recent years, has had more influence for good when upon me than did Ernest and it seemed to me that the bottom had dropped out of every thing when I learned that he wastaken but tho it does still seem that way there is the perfectly sure knowledge that the very little knowledge I have of his life will stay with me as an inspiration.  Tho it was seldom we got together I feel as tho I, too, had lost a brother.
   
   With sympathy which I really cannot express
   sincerely

   There has been a lack of vocal or written sympathy with thee this winter, and this brief message is only to assure thee of my love and frequent thought being freshly flowing.That mere words would only weary thee I know and I only sent messages to thee by notes to Rachel. It was my hope that long before this my own strength would have retuned and enabled me to go to thee. But that is not the case as only a very little exertion ispossible yet - writing, almost is a lost art. Excuse this detail, because I could not otherwise explain my absence. Now we have heard of Edward's illness, and I wish to send by thee my love to Jonathan and Rachel, when it is convient to thee.
   
   We Also understand Edward is much beter, I hope convalescent.Dear, believe me, thy loss is shared in some degree by me, for thy lovely Agnes was especially near to me, her gentle pure spirit now a lasting place in my heart.
   
    She always seemed as one apart from our every-day routine, and now she is in full & glourious development of all her Savoir has prepared her to be for Him. Always lovingly thy

My dear Thomas:-
   
   As my thoughts have gone out in sympathy for thee in the great loss of thy dear father, I have recalled an acrostic which he wrote for my mother after my father's death, just twenty years ago; and which we valued very much. I think it is most touchingly beautiful, especially so, that it now seems almost prophetic of his own entranceinto the heavenly city.
   "Joined to the loved ones who, expectant long,
    On yonder shore his coming did await,
    Singing their jubilant, thanksgiving song,
    Early & late, before the pearly gate,
    Palms in their hands; And robed in spotless
 white,
   Happy to praise their Savior day and night!
   How must his soul have thrilled with rapture,
 when
    On quicken ear, burst the ecstatic song!
    With what transporting joy, behold again
    Earths lost ones gathered in that Heavnely
 throng! 
   Loving, as only ransomed spirits love,
   Love centered in Him who is Eternal love."
   
   Please give my love & sympathy to thy mother and sisters andBelieve me, with sincere sympathy.
   
   Thy Friend,
   Phebe E. H. Haines

Woodbourne
   Sept. 1st 1895
   
   My dear Annette,
   
   When I reached Holmhurst last week Nanna immediately presented me with thy package, and I opened and found the irresistable little gentleman from Dai Nippon. Where did thee pick him up, I wonder! He will be a most pleasant memento of thee, though I shall hesitate to insult his diginity by inkinghis fine skirts! I have thought of thee, and of you all so much this summer, and greatly wished I could have seen thee and Carrie before we leave. I hoped Mrs. Cope would return while I was at Holmhurst, but she is I supppose still with you. If so please give her my dear love. Thee will forgive me I know for this tardy work, I spent a whole week nominally at Holmhurst, actually between the city, Germantown, and all the [---]. Thee knows onlytoo well what such packing is. Now I am enjoying a few day's rest at Woodbourne before going back to Awbury for a square start westward. Virginia here and sends her love, also says to tell thee that I will meet thee in Italy winter after next. I tell her I give the message as hers, not mine! Much as I should like such a prospect; she is much more liekly to turn up there in the next year or two, than I! Lillie and the girls & Thos. & Elizabeth Cope are entertaining Dr. Norris and a Germandoctor friend in the parlor, else they would doubtless send messages. Please give my love to Carrie and Clementine, I understand you are all together, and are glad to know you have that comfort. With dear love for thy own self, and thanks for thinking of me amid so much sorrow, I am as always,
   
   Affectionally thine

Six years ago, when ever joyous Spring 
   scattered rich gifts upon this earth of our's 
   Far sweeter than the sweetest of her flowers, 
   One flower did God to our own garden bring. 
   
   He planted it a noble plant, and gave 
   The charge of it into our loving care, 
   To train it tenderly, so it might bear 
   Fruit to His praise who for such fruit I did crave. 
   
   Ah! how kept we our trust? Was ours the love, 
   Which while it prized the gift loved more the given, 
    And sought with tears, how is might best deliver 
   The entrusted talent back to him above? 
   
   Oh! earthly love, oh! selfish human heart, 
   Weak and mistrustful of God's providence 
   Troubled for many things of time and sense, 
   Yet careless of the one thing needful, the good path! 
   
   Therefore when God our ill kept graden saw, 
   And marked how weeds were climbing o’er the flowers
    So that the refreshing Heavenly showers 
   Might hardly reach them; gently did he draw 
   
   One flower from our keeping, it may be
    Not only to preserve that one from harm, 
But that our careless souls be might alarm, 
   And waken from their false security. 
   Ah me! How little had we dreamed of this
!    Listless, beside our cherished flowers we lay. 
   And as we breathed their fragrance day by day. 
   Looked for no pride awakening from own bliss. 
   
   In distant meadows could we often hear
    The stern old mower what his fatal sythe; 
   But yet our hearts beat ever free & blythe, 
   Since to our garden still he drew not near. 
   
   Angel of Death! Ah! who may ever tell 
   The bitter anguish of our souls, but now 
   No doubt can e'er disturb our faith that thou 
   Wast sent by Him who doeth all things well. 
   
   He called our flower Willie; twas a name 
   Borne by one dearly loved, whose gentle heart
    Waited e'en then the summons to depart; 
   And joyfully received it when it came. 
   
   And we had hoped, that in our brother's stead
    Our darling might be found by name & all 
   His guiltless actions, ever to recall 
   The cherised memories of the loved & dead. 
   
   Such was wour hope; yet may we not repine; 
    Twas matchless wisdom and unbounded love 
   Drew both our precious ones to him above; 
   To make them in His Heavenly courts to shine. 
  Now other names we trust to them are given, 
   In that blest land where our loved flower is growing. 
    The stream of life beside him ever ever flowing, 
   Which maketh glad the heritage of Heaven. 
   
   And now on this his Natal Day, 
   We humbly bend the knee, and pray 
   To Thee, who wast his God always, 
    God of all Consolation, 
   
   That thou our hearts may so incline, 
   So bend our stubborn wills to thine, 
   That we no longer may repine
   In our deep tribulation
   
   We thank Thee God, that Thou hast taken 
   Our Willie from this world of pain, 
   Before upon his robes the stain 
   Of deadly sin did cling. 
   
   And in his sweet simplicity, 
   That thou, most precious thoughts of Thee
    And of Thy Heaven, continually, 
   Before his mind did bring. 
   
   overSo, when thy summons to him came, 
   While suffering racked his tender frame, 
   The call was welcome, as the claim 
   Of friend long dearly known. 
   
   An doubting naught, his willing feet 
   Hastened the messenger to meet, 
   As one he trustingly could greet, 
   Who came to take him home. 
   
   Oh Lord! Thou gainest the victory! 
   Not unto him, but unto Thee 
   Let all the praise and honor be 
   Oh, Lord! our God most glorius! 
   
   Oh! In the darkness of our night 
   When we too wage the fearful fight, 
   May we be made through thy blessed light, 
    Like him o'er death victorious.

   My dear friends
    Francis & Anna Cope,
   
   Those only who have passed thr'o a similar trial, can justly measure the affliction which is now your portion. So I find my heart going out in tender sympathy with yours and our earnest desire that he among whose gracious offices it still is to "heal the broken hearted", and "to comfort them that mourn", may be near to sustain & comfort you.
   
   To a loving parent, the right time never comes, as viewed from our standpoint, to part with a dear child. The infancy, its very tenderness & helplessness beget the care it is there so continually needing. As childhood comes with all its winsome ways, it is surely hard to give the little one up. And when mandhood or womanhood have been reached, and ourhopes brighten for their future, or we fondly look for ripenning fruit from all our care & anxiety & effort for their temporal & spiritual good, a feeling akin to bitter disappointment is mingled with the sorrow, as we bear them to the silent tomb.
   
    But the Christian believer has learned, not only thr'o observing the lots of others, but by his own happy experience, that a Heavenly Father, who "tender mercies are over all His works", and whose "compassions fail rest", knows best how to deal with us and our loved ones, and that "he doeth all things well".  Whether we understand the meaning of the dispenesation or not, we can thr'o our tears exclaim, "The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away, but blessed be the name of the Lord." This filial submission to the Will of God, we well know comes to us only thr'o the humbling, sweetening, calming influences of his grace. But I rejoice to believe you have known & felt its efficacious power, and I long that it may in this time of need, rest largely upon the spirits of you both.Some sweet lines by Charlotte Elliot, you may be already familiar with, but they seem so fitted for those who are passing this heavy trials, that I will add a few stanzas, th'o feeling sure you will appreciate them all.
   
    If those shouldst call me to resign
   What most I prize, it ne'er was mine:
   I only yield thee what was there;
   "Thy will be done".
   
   If but my fainting heart be blest
   With thy sweet spirit for its guest,
   My God! To thee I leave the rest,
   "Thy will be done"
   
   Renew my will from day to day;
   Blend it with thine, and take away
   All that now makes it hard to say,
   "Thy will be done."
   
   Then, when on earth I breathe no more
   The prayer half mixed with tears before,
   We sing, upon a happier shore,
   "Thy will be done"
   
   My lameness still keeps me a cripple,and almost house-bound, or I should gladly have been with you ere this, but the above may express, better perhaps than I could in person, the loving sympathy and desires of
   
   your attached friend,
   Saml Morris.

   My dearest Anna,
    
   When we last parted I had intended to fulfill my promise of writing to thee at a much earlier period than I have done, but my time has been so much occupied that I have found it impossible to do so, and trust thee will not attribute it to forgetfulness, as I can assure thee that although absent, thee is not forgotten. Several of the family have been very much indisposed, grandfather has indeed had quite a severe attack, we scarcely thought he would recover for a day or two, but he is now very much improved and able to be about his room. The weather has been so very warm, I expect you enjoy the country exceedingly there  are but a few persons now remaining in the city, the streets are quite deserted, great numbers have gone to Cape May and other watering places. I understood from a gentleman who had just returned from Saratoga Springs, that the Hotels there were very much crowded, about four hundred visitors at one house.
    
   I regretted exceedingly you were unable to hear Friend Gurney once more before his departure, I can scarcely realise that he has indeed left our native land forever, as he now supposes; there was a little girl inquired of him if he would never return here, and was almost broken hearted, when he placed his hand upon his head and replied, that "his docks were too grey ever to expect to revisit this country". I had several op-portunities of being in company with him and they were much more delightful on account of being unexpected.
   
   The First day morning before he left he attended the North Meeting, and gave us a very interesting and beautiful sermon, taking his text from the sixty third chapter of Isaiah, ninth Verse. After meeting Sister Mary and myself were returning home, when Friend Paul joined us and said, that she had fully expected we would have called to see Friend Gurney the evening before, that there was a number of friends and young people assembled at their house, between sixty and seventy she thought, to bid him Farewell, and insisted upon our going home with her; as she said that it would be our last oppurtunity, we accordingly accepted her invitation, highly grateful as thee may suppose. Our particular facourite E. P. Kirkbride was there when we arrived, and seveal other friends. Friend Gurney was very much pleased to see us, he said that he had been expecting us, and was very glad we had come, he seated himself close by us and conversed awhile very sweetly, after which we bade him adieu, wishing him a prosperous voyage and safe return, he sent his Love to all the family a kiss to the younger ones. He had an appointed meeting at the Arch Street house in the evening. (I was very much surprised a few days after to hear that you had not attended it). It was very large, he addressed us in a very interesting manner and furnished with a most touching prayer, in which he commended all his Endeared Friends, to the protection of that Saviour, who had so long sheltered him under his parent wing, and had been with him, in joy and in sorrow in this land."
   
   When the meeting had concluded, every one rushed to shake hands with him, I think he must have stood twenty minutesbidding all farewell, until I thought his hand really must ache however all were finally satisfied, and we had just returned home, when to our utter amazement who should arrive directly after, but Joseph John he said he must see us all once more, he sat a short time with us, and we then bade him adieu, although I trust it will not be forever. He sailed in "The Roseius" on the 25th, I shall be truly glad when I hear of his safe arrival at home, for surely his children and relations must ardently desire to behold him again, if he makes such an impression upon strangers what must their feelings be? I shall leave the remainder to thy imagination; I have written a long narrative about him my Dear Anna, supposing it would interest thee, if it does not thee must excuse the length of it, and not waste thy time in perusing it. I suppose thee has most probably heard of the death of Harry Collins, and Maria’s loss of her dear little babe, his namesake, so near the same time, poor girl she must feel it very deeply. Sister Susan and family have gone into the country expecting to remain three weeks. Cousin S. Cresson is no anxiously awaiting the arrival of her son Charles &c they intended sailing on the 25th in the "Great Western" for New York, I suppose they will arrive here in a week or ten days.
   
   Brother Wm is very anxious that some of us should take a trip through Pennslyvania, we had thought of going to Cape May for the benefit of the bathing the Dr. having recommended it for George, but Mama was so unwilling that he should be near the sea, we have concluded that a mountain ride, will perhaps be equally beneficial, I do not think it likely we shall be absent longer than a week. My letter has become so very lengthy, that I have only room to add do write me a very long letter and very soon, give my love to all inquiring friends of course reserving a lrage portion for thyself and hoping this will find you all in a perfect state of salubrity believe mestill thy sincerely attached friend and cousin
   
   Hannah S Vaux
   
   P.S. Please excuse all blunders and do not allow any one to read this but thyself. (A speedy answer Dear Anna).

   [Jan ? 1901] 
   
   Dearest Family, 
   
   Well!  I have had two visits since I last wrote, & mighty nice ones they were.  Aunt L & Ellie came the first time (I told you I wondered  which 2 it would be, didnt I?) & after theyhad been here about an hour & we had a good talk Dr. Stedman came up and said they would have time for a cup of tea at the [---] House (his house you know) & that Miss Stedman was there-  Mrs. Stedman was away unfortunately.  He asked me to come down, too, so we all went& I enjoyed it ever so much, as it was the first time I had been inside their house.  I was sorry Aunt Lilly didn't see Mrs. Stedman, but I believe they have asked her & Miss Stedman to lunch with them at Brunswick so they will meet after all.  I was in hopes the Doctor would let me go into lunch with them some day this week but he thinks I am not quite ready for that, so they are coming out again.  Mary & Frank came on Monday & we had a jolly time, & Polly is coming out with Aunt Lilly & Ellie when they come, I think.  Frank will come again, toosometime, I guess & I have found out that I can call him up on the telephone if I want to.  I had a nice little talk with Polly last evening on that instrument, & a few words with Aunt Lilly.  The latter is not very fond of talking on it& they have had some rather funny times I guess, as they have telephones in their rooms to the office instead of bells.  To-day they are Cambridge.  I believe, lunching with Mr. Foote at the Colonial Club, & are at present looking at the glass flowers, I expect.  Of course youknow [---] or "tea" for them, & they met lots of people there.  I told Dr. Stedman I was crazy to go to it, & he said he would love to let me, but he didnt think I was up to it.  Perhaps I shall get to Class Day, however. 
   
   To change the subject, I dont think I ever acknowledged the little bookthee mailed me, Mother dear, from Aunt Lizzie Cope.

The card case is all right & so are the photos, but I'm going to bother you to send mesome more things.  Thanks very much for these first, however.  The other things are- 1. the little lace tie to go around your neck, which Cousin Hannah sent me last summer- 2. my two lace collars- one of [---] edged with lace, & one of illusion with wide lace onthe edge- 3 my little gold pin (not a strap pin but a clasp) one of a pair I used to have, & my little white wreath pin (that is if it is all right to send them by mail), 4 & some more photos.  It is so nice to have those you sent, & I want more.  I'd like my group of the GoldenWedding for one thing, & if there is a copy of that picture of Mother & me I want that & there is a picture of Esther in a little frame & one of Mary Emlen- & any others you can find.  I cant have too many-  If the frames are bulky dont send them, though I'd like to have the ones Esther & Mary are in,if you can manage it.  If there are any old kodak pictures of Awbury or Conanicut send them, too, but dont bother too much.  You see it is so nice to have them to show to Miss Webb & other people to whom I talk about things, besides the phasum of having them to look at myself.  I do wish therewas a good one of Father-  You might send me the family group.  He is pretty good in that.  The one of the house you sent is great & I have it on my bureau, next to the boys. 
   
   Now I'm going to stop this scrawl.  I hope you dont think I'veasked for a great many things.  Miss Richardson thinks my bloomers are in my trunk.  I'm awfully sorry.  Miss R. wants to be remembered to Mother. 
   
   With lots of love I am in great haste. 
   Your very loving
   
   Anna.

   [Jan ? 1901] 
   
   Dearest Family, 
   
   Well!  I have had two visits since I last wrote, & mighty nice ones they were.  Aunt L & Ellie came the first time (I told you I wondered  which 2 it would be, didnt I?) & after theyhad been here about an hour & we had a good talk Dr. Stedman came up and said they would have time for a cup of tea at the [---] House (his house you know) & that Miss Stedman was there-  Mrs. Stedman was away unfortunately.  He asked me to come down, too, so we all went& I enjoyed it ever so much, as it was the first time I had been inside their house.  I was sorry Aunt Lilly didn't see Mrs. Stedman, but I believe they have asked her & Miss Stedman to lunch with them at Brunswick so they will meet after all.  I was in hopes the Doctor would let me go into lunch with them some day this week but he thinks I am not quite ready for that, so they are coming out again.  Mary & Frank came on Monday & we had a jolly time, & Polly is coming out with Aunt Lilly & Ellie when they come, I think.  Frank will come again, toosometime, I guess & I have found out that I can call him up on the telephone if I want to.  I had a nice little talk with Polly last evening on that instrument, & a few words with Aunt Lilly.  The latter is not very fond of talking on it& they have had some rather funny times I guess, as they have telephones in their rooms to the office instead of bells.  To-day they are Cambridge.  I believe, lunching with Mr. Foote at the Colonial Club, & are at present looking at the glass flowers, I expect.  Of course youknow [---] or "tea" for them, & they met lots of people there.  I told Dr. Stedman I was crazy to go to it, & he said he would love to let me, but he didnt think I was up to it.  Perhaps I shall get to Class Day, however. 
   
   To change the subject, I dont think I ever acknowledged the little bookthee mailed me, Mother dear, from Aunt Lizzie Cope.  I [---] it all night, & sometime will you give her my love & thank her very much for me?  Then the photos & the card-case Aunt L brought.  The card case is all right & so are the photos, but I'm going to bother you to send mesome more things.  Thanks very much for these first, however.

Woodbourne
   Sunday, July 16, 1911
   
   Dear Aunt Lilly, 
   
   I want to thank thee very, very much for thy letter to me, so full of love and sympathy and helpful thought for Jack and me and for us all. Thee knows, I am sure, how glad we all are of the assurance that the miles which separate us cannot prevent the, being with us in spirit, nor us with thee. I am sure this experience of sudden and great sorrow has given us all, (and many, also, I think, outside our family circles), a new vision of the sacredness and beauty of these lives of ours however commonplace their daily rounds may seem and to me, I think, the greatest inspiration of all comes from the thought of how dear Ern's spirit by the dark, faithfulness of his unselfishness, which all who knew him felt, was unconsciouslygrowing to that wonderful capacity for selflessness which he so beautifully displayed in those last hours. I know he would be the last one to wish praise that was not due or ever praise at all but he would rejoice for us all together from this experience and to go forward with more and more steadfast faithfulness to the light that is given us. 
   
   It is lovely being up here all together in the quiet peace  of the woods and hills with Frank and Ev and I wish we had thee, too. Woodbourne is almost like another home to me. 
   
   Harold, I am sorry to say, had to leave us today, but he went I am sure much the better for his eight days here and enjoyed it all very much. You are all very good to take us in so generously. 
   
   I have read Jack's note and see that she has mentioned that this is Ernest's Birthday. I think we all feel much as she says about his appreciation of Woodbourne and  love of nature. 
   
    Mother and Anna seem wonderfully well, I think, and it has been very good for Alg, too. The weather is very pleasant, a delightful breeze keeping the hilltop cool and fresh today. 
   
    Alg is the only other member of the family about us now and he sends a great deal of love to thee and to you all. I join warmly in his message with a special one of love to Ell. And please tell her how much her letter meant to us all. How I wish she were here with us now! 
   
    We were very sorry to hear of Uncle Tom's loss on the way up. We did, indeed appreciate having him with us at Awbury and all he did for us. 
   
   Thy very affectionate nephew
   Edward.

Meadowfield 9.3.
   
   My beloved sister
   I feel as tho' I wanted to send thee another greeting before you leave Newport, thy last letter was very welcome with its good report of your welfare, I trust you have all continued in good case & will return home strengthened for the cares & duties of the winter.  As to dear little Edward, I do not suppose we shall know him, nor doubt he has changed much, I hope he will make up his mind to take food when he really needs it, perhaps he may take to a cup & spurn if a bottle is too insulting to his dignity.  Rebekah Smith's little boy is growing nicely & is a cute baby with the large dark eyes, your children ought to our ideas, & tho' his fractures are rather too large now for baby beauty he promises to develope that trait after awhile; at present his great charm is his good behavior, which is a real comfort to his mamma as her nurse left her sooner than she wished & she has only a young girl to assist her in taking care of him.  I suppose it will not be very long now before you are turning your faces homeward & it will be pleasant to think of your bring near us.  tho' we shall not see one another for awhile.  I am glad to hear from a letter to Katharine from Jthat you will not move into your own house until the 11th month, as I would like to be on hand at that season, having a fancy for such dissipations.  I have seen allusions in the papers to the burning of The Cliff House, but have not seen any account of the event, what a favor you were not there! & how about the boarders, did they lose their things was anyone hurt, poor Mrs Emmons I hope she was not there, (or thy Aunt Lizzie).  By the way what do you hear of the latter.  I trust her trip to England has been of use to her, when do you expect her back.  I am sorry to hear that Hazen is not very strong, perhaps he did too much, it seemed a very short time to be absent.  Since our last letter to thee we have had a visit from Susan Kito & Amy Roberts, they are bothundemonstrative people, especially Susan, but they enjoyed being here I think, SK was not well & did not like to ride so we had a quiet time, reading, talking, examining flowers & looking at objects in the compound microscope, one of Frank's late investments; they took tea at sister Eleanor's & also at Joshua's.  Sister Eleanor's summer home was vacated on 3rd day, she, Tom, Ellie, & Walter drove home with the two horses & carriage she spent one night at Arondale & one at HM Stokes at Chester & reached Germantown on 5th day evening.  Hetty & Wistar have gone to "Uncle Gideon's" & Betty is staying with us; the stay down here has been a real succes, the children have been very well & happy, have found much to interest & occupy them.Wistar & Franky have spent many hours in "bug hunts" & do manifest much zeal in the collection of beetles, butterflys & moths, & really have quite a large number; we labor under great difficulty as far as the study of the subject is concerned, as we have no books on Entomology except one by [Wood?] which treats of British insects, I quite want to get some good work & be able to learn the names of some of the creatures the boys have.  I have wandered away from my starting point, sister Eleanorfound the quiet of the country life & the absense of the many demands on her time & thoughts that she has to meet in Germantown a great rest, & altho' the house has not much to attract as regards situation it did not make the same difference to her it would to us, as she is so fond of riding she was out almost daily & enjoyed taking others drives.  Thee may remember Katharine & I find great comfort in sitting under the trees or lying in the hammocks when not busy sewing.  I suppose Hetty will stay down some weeks yet, her trip to Mt [Desert?] brokeinto her summer & I think she dont feel at all ready to leave Maryland.  John & Walter came down yesterday with Frank but dont expect to make much of a visit as they talk of going back tomorrow.  We heard a report that Sophy Kimber was to be married at Newport this summer, does thee know if it is so, her certificate has been sent on from 12th st, we shall miss her from Germantown she is so efficient & willing.  Now my dear sister when thee writes, which I hope may be [---] long, please tell us how thee is, Katharine wishes to know if thee has picked up any fat in the cool air, how does thy nurse geton, I hope she has proved an efficient help.  It is raining quite heavily now, which is not as acceptable as at some seasons, but when I think how we have longed for it in former days I dont like complaining.  The season of canning has arrived & folks in this part of the country are busy enough putting up corn, tomatoes & peaches &c, I should feel dubious about eating the products of some of the factories, as they employ Bohemians whose cleanliness is more than doubtful.  We were quite startled to see the death of Mary Morton yesterday, she spent a few days with Rebekah some 2 weeks ago, but was not well then & wished to get to Phila, it is such a favor she went up when she did or she might have died here.  Please give my love to thy mother & Lilly, kiss the dear children for me & accept for thyself a message of warmaffection from thy attached sister K sends love Hannah B. Evanscan thee tell us anything of the Newhalls.  Ive not heard from A for some time & fear her mother is more poorly.

   My dear sister
   
   I am once more at home and quite miss hearing of thy welfare and dear Anna's from Jonathan's letters.  I hope you still continue to gain and enjoy the mountain air.  When I got home last 2nd day, I felt very much used up with the heat & the change in air, but now have become accustomed to it and feel quite well, tho' the amount of moisture in the air makes things damp & sticky.  No doubt thee has heard particulars of E.W. Copes last hours, the close must have been very peaceful, both Ellie & Madgie express their feelings of thankfulness that their mother did not have to endure long confinement and great suffering.  The funeral was small, so many are away, S. Morris and E Allen bore testimony to her character, there was nothing said at the grave but there was such a sweet, quiet feeling as we stood silently there in the evening lights, everything looking so beautiful & peaceful, words did not seem to be needed.  E. Allen said after meeting today to Eleanor & me, that after sheheard of E.W. Copes death she went into her room and such a sweet feeling came over her, she felt it was a forecast of the rest & peace into which Elizabeth Cope had entered.  I rode to the ground with cousin Rebecca Evans, she spoke of cousin Elizabeth, said the letter thee wrote her had been such a particular comfort and help to her, that Rebecca had felt she must write & tell thee but has been rather burdened with calls, so I said I would let thee know about it, I think R sent her love to thee.  Will & Grace have both had mumps, and little Mary, (Alice'sdaughter) has been very sick, she is now gaining down at the Dennis and Grace has been there with them.  Cousin Wm & John Rhoads have gone to T. Brown's camp for their vacation.  I send thee one of Esthers letters as thee may be interested to hear something of the Conference.  It seems to have been a time of spiritual refreshment & uplifting & I hope may prove of use to the building up of the Church.  Eleanor says the spirit of love & unity was very marked, Alfred urged that all [---] and feelings of antagonism between old & young, conservative & progressive should be laidaside, which seemed to be the case.  Alfred seems to feel his mind relieved of the concern, he went back to Bupshire yesterday & is going on to Northfield.  Frank Goodhue also went to Bupshire will spend today there & go on to Brattleboro taking little Mary with him.  Edith Silver came up on 5th day eve, it was very pleasant to see her, she went home yesterday, Betty & little Elizabeth & Sam Mason all went with her.  Betty intends spending a couple of weeks at Swallowfield where she hopes to have a good rest.  Francis Jr is at Bupshire so all the children are cared for.  Sister Eleanor & Tom I believe are going to Bupshire soon & Wistar to the South on business so the house will be deserted  for awhile.  Katy & the childrenpropose coming home on 3rd day.  Frank came on to the funeral but went back last night, I am glad for him to have a visit there.  Emma Edwards fell in her house and broke her hip, she is now very ill not expected to live & her life is not to be [---] under the circumstances.  I had an active time last week attending meetings but got on better than I expected to, tomorrow is Phila Quarterly Mg & 5th day ours, after that I shall take a rest and do a little here at home, as I see many things that need looking after.  I dont know when Esther will come home probably in about a week.  A great deal of love to dear Anna & also for thyself from thy attached sister

   Dearest Grandma, 
   
   It was dear of thee to write to me & I certainly appreciate thy doing so & thank thee very much.  Mother, Aunt Lilly Alg & I have already enjoyed thy letter & I will give it to Harold when I get a chance.  He is over near the polls this afternoon trying to get people to register, as this is the last day.  This evening he is going3
   down to Mrs. [Brabury's].  Thee knows he is to be an usher for Paul Brown next fourth day. 
   
   I am sorry not to have written before this to thank thee for the lovely visit I had at4
   Northeast.  I did so enjoy it, & you have done so much for us all,- this summer.  Thank thee very much, dear Grandma, & I want to thank Uncle Tom, too.  I am so sorry to have given so5
   much trouble with my ticket & hot-water bag! 
   
   Well!  the wedding came off yesterday, & in spite of the rain it was lovely.  Jac made such a lovely little bride, & Edward was beaming.6
   They had the ceremony in the large parlor right in front of the Mantel-piece this way-
   [illustration] 
   The mantel piece was decorated with maiden-hair & white7
   [---] & there were jars of white daisy-like flowers on each side.  Little Theodore & Brewster in white sailor suits & with little baskets of tiny white chrysanthemums stood on one side.  They did not8
   walk in.  Joe & Alg walked in just as we started the first hymn-  Dick is bringing thee a leaflet with the hymns on it-  Then Theodora & Eleanor came walking in with little Mary be-9
   tween them- all with baskets like the little boys- then came Jac & her father.  They all stood in front of the fire place.  The ceremony was lovely- Joe was fine & Ed & Jac were "dear"10
   & it was all so solemn & full of feeling.  After the benediction they all sat down-  I tried to mark where on the plan- & there was a few minutes of silent worship.  Then the last hymn & they11
   walked out.  They came back soon, however, & stood in front of the mantel to speak to people.  We all sat down to the breakfast.  There were 24 at the brides table- I will put in a plan to show12
   how we sat.  There was an enormous bride's cake in the center & this with white [---] & white china [---] as decoration made the table pretty.  The cake had a ring, thimble & piece of money in it & Jac cut13
   it.  They had no wedding cake.  They got off very nicely in Henry Scattergoods auto, after running down stairs & through the crowd & getting sprinkled with rice! 14
   I expect Dick will be with thee by the time this arrives & will tell thee about the wedding.  Please give her my best love & tell her I will write to her soon.  Please give my love to Aunt Anna & Uncle Theo. & Uncle Tom & keep much, dear Grandma, for thyself,

Title: 1873 July 26, London, to brother

London 7 mo 26th 73
   
   Dear brother
   
   I have been intending for some time to write thee a letter but since our arrival in London there has been so much to do and so little time for writing that I have dont next to nothing in that line-  And now what shall I tell thee about for between Chellie and Tom both of whom have written I feel as if there was nothing left for me to say-  On fifth day last we went to the Zoological Garden and I do wish thee could have been along, we were very much amused as well as interested-
   
   The first thing that struck us in particular was the storks.  With their long legs (only one of which they stand upon at a time) their necks which they draw well down between their hunched up shoulders, their grave or rather I may say melancholy expression gives them a ridiculous appearance and when they gyrate or give a great jump as they sometimes do with no apparent object it was perfectly [inesistable]-  The monkey house also proved a place of no small amusement-  as we visited it about 11 o'clock I suppose it was the hour for the old monkies to be taking their morning naps however that may be a number of them were asleep-  One old ape amused us very much he was taking a nap upon one of the bars and apparently the last idea that had entered his head beforefalling asleep was that it would be desirable to scratch his head so he would raise his arm until his hand nearly reached his head and then down it would drop, this he repeated over and over again-  In another cage there were three asleep upon one of the roosts with their arms around each other0  In other cages there were the usual pranks and absurdities going on which monkies indulge in. 
   
   The keeper of the laughing hyenas was very obliging and gave us the opportunity of hearing "the very remarkable noise" which the song informs us the animal makes every fifteen minutes"- 
   
   In the snake house every thing seemed to be in a very quiet state most of the snakes being coiled up  under their blankets-  One or two of the Boa Constrictors were tied up in sundry knots and laid out on the tree to sun-  We saw quite as much of them as we care to snakes not being our favorites-  We next visited the Hippopotomi and Rhinoceros.  The former are the most ungainly looking animals I ever saw.  There is a little one only eight months old and altho' so young its body so much longer than an ox.  The keeper brought some grass to feed them and made them open their mouths-  But I will stop for I am afraid I have said too much already about animals-  I think thee would be very amused at some of the servants we see here the absurd way they are dressed-  Not unfrequently5
   we see footmen with drab coats with brass buttons, crimson breeches, white stockings, low shoes and with either white wigs or powdered hair-
     
   The other day I saw an old fashioned coach by an old fashioned coach I mean one driven in the style of olden time four horses with a guard who had a long horn which he was blowing as they drove through the streets.  I believe it is owned and driven by a young lord who having plenty of money and a fancy for that sort of thing amuses himself in this way-  He has men to attend to all the money matters and to the passengers while he just drives-  Yesterdat we went out to the Crystal Palace and spent most of the day there-  It is a wonderful place so much to see-  It is something like our Sanitary Fair was, if thee remembers that, only on a larger scale.  We went around until we were very tired and then we dined.  After dinner we continued out investigations visiting amongst other things the "[---] animals"- These are large creatures made to represent what they suppose some of the extinct species were like-  They are placed about among the trees and on the edge of one of the lakes in natural positions but it struck us there was a good deal of humbling about it-  One sixth day evening last Tom, Rueben, & I went to Parliament-  We couldnot get seats for Chellie and H as they told us they were often engaged a week ahead in the ladies gallery-  We had rather an amusing experience-  We reached the hall about five minutes of nine and were told we would have to wait for a few minutes as the  House was just being made up.  We were seated with a number of others upon benches in the Hall and after waiting for sometime the first was told it might go in and then the second-  We passed up a long flight of stairs and went into a little toom where our tickets (which Tom had purchased from a man in the afternoon) were examined we were in a bitter trepidation while this was going on as we did not know whether they were good for anything or not, however they passed us- As soon as weentered the gallery the janitor came to us and pointed us to seats into which we sank he then told us we must park our hats under the seats, then he turned to another man and told him he must not raise up to see, then he made another man put his umbrella upon the seat behind him not allowing him to hold it in his hand so if he had ordered us to pull off our shoes I should not have been surprised- We heard three or four speeches upon the Army bill and were very much amused-  Every once in a while the speakers would get rather muddled and there would come a succession of aws and grunts and hesitations which was absurd-  And then there were occasional mysterious sounds which at9
   last we discovered was applause in the shape of hear! hear!-  How they made such sounds I dont know it was a kind of mingled mumble and rattle it put me in mind of the child that swallowed the bead necklace-  We stayed until nearly half past eleven and then concluded we had got nearly two shillings worth and would go. 
   
   This morning we went to Westminster meeting and were not a little surprised upon going into see Chas & Anna Sharples and their daughter-  After meeting we had quite a talk with them and learn that they are going to sail on the second of next mo:-  They have visited Vienna Switzerland France &c [---] trip ideed-  We also met Wm Bradford (the Artist) who is spending the summer in London) he was very kind and invited us to come to his studio-  Bevan Braithwaite was at meeting and pressed us to come and see him when we return a very warm hearted Friend.  We expect to leave tomorrow for the north-  Tell mother we are all pretty well-  Please give a great deal of love to father and mother and each one of brothers & sisters.  Tell them none must feel slighted when letters are not addressed to them individually for all our letters are intended for all.  Please give love to them at Uncle Johns & Toms also at School Lane.  Chellie joins me in message of love.  Please excuse this writing as I am using a quill pen which writes better on this paper than a steel one-  With much love I am thy affectionate brother

   Having received a message from thee through a letter to Tom, and not being able to plead sickness as a reason for not writing, I am going to send thee a greeting-  Well we are not going to see thee until next spring, it seems a long time, and we were all of us not a little disappointed when the news came.  We were counting the days until the time when thee was to sail and beginning to speculate upon the probable length of the passage, when suddenly all our hopes were dashed-  I was going to say I would not flatter thee by telling thee what lamentations there were on the part of some of us, but I think it does no one harm to know how much they are loved and missed at home, on the contrary I think  to a young man it does good, tending perhaps to keep him out of some things by which he might otherwise be tempted-  Now for the scrape of news I can glean up-  Last fourth day Tom and I drove over to Haverford to bring away thy [chattels?]-  We arranged to go on third day, but on that day we had a regular old fashioned Nor'easter and it poured most of the day-  The next morning about nine oclock Tommy appeared at our house in the [---] with Lady and Eric (Harry having been laid up some time with sore feet) after getting some more warm wraps for it had cleared off quite cold when we started-  The roads were in a pretty miserable state of muddiness and as we undertook to go by the Lancaster road we almost stuck so to speak-  However we reached the College about half past eleven, and finding the students in recitation we went up stairs and explored-  We found all thy things had been moved out of thy room and were locked up in another closet of which the matron hadkey so she had to be hunted up-  We packed most of the books and some other things in a drawer which Tommy and I carried down to the front door Tommy saying it was "like carrying down a little coffin"-  We donated to Frank Haines a bottle of eye wash, a little bottle of carbolic acid and a few other valuables?-  Thus were the last rites performed-  We packed the books in the bottom of the wagon, and put the precious articles, around with we supposed tender associations ( clung , (a broken fan with names thereon &c) between folds of the down cover-  We drove home to dinner reaching Awbury about quarter of four-  We had a good laugh at Tom - one of the objects over was to bring home the hanging book shelf and we forgot all about it, and came home without it - which rankled in Tommy's breast-  By the way talking of Haverford does thee know they have raised a sufficient amount of money to enable them to build, and Samuel Alsop Jr told me it was decided to go ahead-  The day we werethere was the day before Thanksgiving day, and as I waited upstairs in the entry while Tom was hunting up the Matron I was amused at two of the students, one was in the hall down stairs and as the other came out I suppose from recitation - he announced the fact that they were going to have Turkey for dinner, whereupon there went up such a howl of rejoicing as almost upset me-  We hoped while at Haverford to have had time to have called upon Margaret Yarnall, but we spent to much time at Any Marys that we had not time.  I suppose you have heard that Ellis and M Yarnall are boarding at [---] during the Winter.  I am glad to hear they are vert comfortably fixed-  It seems an out of the way kind of place for them, a good deal away from most of the latter's friends, I should think she would long to have her daughter with her.  I do feel for them very much-  First day 12/5.  A week, my dear Afred, has passed since I commenced this letter yet it is not finished.5
   During the week we have been pained from day to day to hear of Uncle Alfred's increasing illness.  As early as the beginning of the week Dr Wister said he seemed to be failing, and on second day they telegraphed for James, they received an answer the next morning only saying "will come" and that is all they have heard.  Up to second day Uncle Alfred has been able to get over into the library, this he has accomplished with the aid of a man who has been staying with him at night for a number of weeks- assisting him to dress and undress.  One second day he was so much weaker that he had to remain in bed- and since then he has been gradually growing weaker and weaker, until yesterday afternoon about three o'clock he quietly passed away-  He does not seem to have had any acute disease-  His appetite almost entirely gave out, and he gradually weakened - with the exception of a pain in one of his lungs I do not think he has suffered any-  Since last first day Uncle Tom and John E Carter have been sitting up with him half of alternate nights, the nurse sitting up the other half.  Lilly and Edward have been staying over at Fairfield for the last day or two-  Yesterday morning having heard how he was the evening before Father, Uncle Tom and Aunt Lizzie went over there, the Doctor came soon after they arrived and said he did not think he could live but a few minutes.  They went up into his room (except Father who had gone on to town) and sat there for two hours awaiting the close- he seemed entirely conscious but lay perfectly still excepting once when he passed his hand through his hair as his custom was and once he put his hand under his head-  They went to dinner and a few minutes after dinner was over he passed away, no one but Aunt Rebecca, Lily and Edward being present.  Just at the close, there was a short spasm and then to him all was joy and peace and rest-  What a wonderful and glorious change it must be for him after a long life of ill health and suffering during which I suppose he could never have said he really felt well, to awake inthat Holy City none of whose inhabitants can say I sick and where "there shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, neither shall there be ay more pain: for the former things are passed away"-  Aunt Caroline seems to feel it very much, not having seen for some time except a few days ago, when hearing how sick he was she went out to see him, but ut was thought best for her not to go in the room or let him see her so she looked at him through the door-  The only remarks I have heard that Uncle Alfred made (though he probably said more which I have not heard) were that some days ago he told J.E.C. "that it made very little difference which way it ended" meaning his sickness-  To E. Allen who visited home within a few days, and as she was leaving said she supposed she should never see him on earth again and that she did not doubt but that the change would be a glorious one to him he replied "I have been forced to feel very quiet and peaceful"  I think those were the words he used-  The funeral is to be next third day at two oclock.  It will be a great trial I doubt not to James to find all over when hearrives - 
   
   Last sixth day Uncle Tom commenced his winter readings and it was said to have been a very interesting occasion-  Neither Chellie nor I was able to get there-  There is a good deal of stir in our City now over the meetings of Moody & Sankey-  They have fitted up the old freight depot of the Pennsylvania RR so that it will seat about eleven thousand and meetings are being held I think twice on week days and three times on first days - they are largely attended and from accounts some of them must be impressive.  I hope they may do good-
   
   I suppose Mother in her weekly letter told you that Hazen had sprained his ancle, turned it under him as he was rushing out of the side door to catch the train-  Tommy seems to think it was a mercy he sprained it as it will probably save him from something worse if he will only take warning.  He had to hold it up for nearly a week.  However he is about again now tho he says it feels weak.  Aunt Lizzie Brown is still down at Atlantic City where she has been for some 9
   weeks and from accounts does not seem much better.  Aunt Fanny went down last third day taking with her a maid to stay with aunt Lizzie-  I am afraid her sickness is a pretty serious one and not to be gotten over in a hurry.  The rest of them at Grandfathers are pretty well now-  Grandfather has had a cold but is better-  Aunt Martha Leeds I suppose you have heard is at the Frankford Asylum, and from last accounts was not much better in her mind and was also very sick with [---] in her head-  I dont know whether thee has heard or not that the new building at Haverford is to go up next year they having got enough subscribed to warrant them in commencing so Samuel Alsop Jr told me.
   
   Lillies letter from [---] arrived on sixth day last and we were very glad to hear of your being so comfortably and pleasantly fixed-  Please give a great deal of love to both Lilly and Alexis and tell them I often think of them both with much affection and truly it does seem a long long time since we parted with them.  I do hope the stay will do you all a great deal of good-  I am afraid you have missed some of our letters Chell and I both misunderstood and have been directing our letters to Brown-Shipley & Co Liverpool - and I am afraid they have not forwarded them-  I wrote not long ago a letter to thee and one to Lilly and Alexis enclosing a photograph of the baby to each-  If they have never come to hand I will send you another-  Harry has at last made up his mind to return to Minneapolis - he expects to start next fourth day.  I hope he will have a more prosperous time the coming year than he has had the last-  Upon looking over the forepart of this letter which I wrote a week ago I find I have mentioned about the building at Haverford in that so thee will please excuse my telling it again-  I dont feel like rewriting the letter-  Chell sends her love to you all in which I join and wish you "a merry Christmas" and "a happy New Year"-  I remain thy
   loving brother

   My Darling wife, I stayed out to meeting this morning and on my arrival at this office at noon found thy telegram and Algie's letter awaiting me. Dear little boy I am very glad to hear he is better and it was very thoughtful and kind of thee dearest to telegraph. We are going along very nicely at home. Tom and Alf and I had dinner at 7 o'clock last night and it was very nice. We had fricasseed chicken, potato peas and [beets?] and then raspberries for dessert and tea was on the side board and we each took a cup at the close of the meal. We then adjourned to the piazza at about 8:15. 
   
   [We?] weather is very pleasant the thermo. at my side as I write marking 86° at this hour 3 PM. I was very much surprised to hear of the death of Hannah Newhall. She is to be burried to morrow at 2 o'clock from our house.  I was tired last evening and so did not go over to call until this morning I found Abby and Mary in a very resigned? and very cheerful state. They said they did not regret at all having moved out and were glad of it. They said they were afraid we would not like to have the funeral from our house and hoped there mothers death then would not cast a gloom over the house for us-  I assure them that it would not in the least and that I was very glad they were going to have the funeral from there-  Abby said the great heat of last week seemed to prostrate their mother and she gradually sank away until third day morning she quietly ceased to breathe without struggle-  Ally said she was leaning over her at the time doing something and her bother had her hand closed upon a handkerchief and she said she noticed her hand gently relaxed and ther handkerchief dropped this was all that markedthe change.  William Newhall was there and he told me he was so glad his sisters had such a place to stay in and Abby and Mary both seems so glad they were when they were and not at a boarding house or hotel.  They said it had seemed like home to them from the very first day they move out.  I sent them some flowers on my way to meeting.  They want me to be on hand at the time of the funeral to do some things for them so I shall go out in the 12 M train.
   
   We had a good meeting this morning Cousin James and Samuel Morris spoke-  Cousin James came to me after meeting and said they were so much obliged for our kindness to Anna &c-  I am better dearest the pain in my back is almost entirely gone and my [---] is less.  Tell Mother we concluded it would be more polite for me to call on Lena so I drove over there before meeting and invited her to come over and stay sixth day night with us and she accepted-  Nancy left last evening going into town at 7 o clock.  Everything is moving along very serenely so far as I know.  It is fun to see Tommy studying [---] and Paramous book at the breakfast table getting up a menu winding up by saying "Well!  I hate this business"  My dearest my thoughts are with you a great great deal and I do hope thee will take care of thyself and that you all may be better.  Give my love to Father Mother and all the rest and wish a heartful for thy own dear self I am thine
   J Evans.
   Dont tire thyself with writing much altho it is delightful to hear from thee.

   My own dear wife
   
   Anna and Hazen arrived home yesterday in good condition and as Anna wrote to mother yesterday I will not go into details of the journey or arrival.  They were however the [---] of various testimonials of love to me so that I feel quite rich.  Dear little children how sweet it was of them, however I am going to write each of them a letter either today or tomorrow.  I am ever so much obliged dearest for thy letter-  I am so glad to hear that Algie seems so much better and hope he will continue to improve-  I am glad thee is not pressing the Cod Liver oil as I am afraid it will upset his stomach and thus do more harm than good.  When thee writes tell me what the Dr thinks of his condition.  I am more and more inclined to think he caught the disease from Edward.
   
   We have been to meeting this morning and had sermons from E. Allen and W Kite and a prayer from Sarah Johnson.  The meeting was small.  We brought Cousin Anna Rhoads home with us as she was all alone-  Cousin James having gone to New Hope to spend First day.  Hazen and Anna expect to go over to Cousin C Hartshorne to tea this evening.  We are getting along very nicely dearest and thee need not feel the least concerned about.  I am really very comfortable and as to health am much better I have a good appetite in fact I expect I eat too much for my dyspepsia - which however is better - And now dearest I want to tell thee that I am sorry I said what I did at Newport-  I know my natural tendency is when everything goes along smoothly to settle down build castles in thr air and enjoy this world and I have no doubt that I need to be [---] more and more from this world and that our loving and merciful Heavenly Father breaks up my rest and [---] this world's pleasures that I may look beyond and have my heart fixed on Heaven and Heavenly things -  Our Heavenly Father does not willingly affect and if it only has the effect intended it will be but one of the light affliction which last but for a moment-  Therefore my dearest pray that I may grow better and better - I reallylong that such may be the case but the flesh is very weak.  I feel as our dear children are growing up I should be a better example to them -  So dearest do not worry about me but try and get well and strong-  I think of thee very very often with the tenderest love and pray that we may grow together in best things which I know will make us happen and happen in each other and in out Children.  Farewell dearest.  Give my love to Mother and Aunt Mary and the [---] abd with lots for thy own dear self 
      I am thy loving husband

  Dear Mother
  
  Aunt Mary received thy letter this morning or rather we did as we all read it first & then gave it to aunt Mary.  Cousin Charles & Carry & cousin Ellie Yarnall arrived last night or rather this morning, as the boat didnt get in till after 5 o'clock, consequently they were so tired that they are not going to get up till dinner time.  they could not get any state rooms & had to take berths so were very sick.  We took cousin Becky Howell & Annie out riding yesterday afternoon over to the three beaches & had a splendid time & got a good many shells, then in the evening we went out rowing on the bay with Eddie Howell & uncle H (the former makes a pretty good [bean?]) in the moonlight & sought the waves of the steam boats coming in, it was splendid, Lilly tried to row a little, but did not succeed very well.  Tell Aunt Annie I am going to get the story of the Haunted House fresh from Hannah Williams & Lilly or I will write it to her if she wants to know it very badly.  We were very glad to hear that you have cooler weather at home it must have been very hot - (pardonme, mamma) but it is only a slip of the tongue, I have in vain looked for hot in thy letters it's only "excessively warm."  Tell Hazen, Anna says she is going to bring home some shells to him & she wants him to answer her letter to him as soon as possible.  Aunt Mary sends her love & says she thinks she feels a little stronger though she don't attempt to walk far.  Anna wants me to tell Franky that some of the shells she is going to bring him are called boats & if he will put them in water they will float.  Love to papa, Alfred, Nannie & all at home & believe me thy loving daughter

  Dear Sister-
  Chellie received thy letter at the dinner table to day, but feels rather disinclined to write in the few minutes we have to spare before going to ride.  We had a fine South West wind yesterday and again to day so that the surf at the bathing beach was first rate this morning.  Charles and Carry, Elly and our party with two ladies from this house made a [load?] for the omnibus and we all enjoyed the sight and sound of the beaches very much, but Henry, Jimmie, Elly, and Lilly, were the only ones to go in.  they had a splendid bath they said.  H. unfortunately is deaf in one ear since and does not feel quite well so I doubt their going in tomorrow unless C. escorts them - and he has the rheumatism - Charly thinks Newport air is all sufficient without bathing.-  H. says I have no time to write as the carriage will be here.  Chelly is quite well, and all the rest.  aff thy sister Mary
  Love to Frank and the children. P.S. Dear Frank - In writing my review which is on hand, I want to make sure of a word I think wrongly used in the book review, and have no dictionary here.  Will thee please look in your Imperial Dictionary, - or the Text of the Iconographic (Anatomical part) & send me word, if found, in your next letter, whether there are not two words, ilium and ileum,

  Aunt Mary received thy letter this morning or rather we did as we all read it first & then gave it to aunt Mary.  Cousin Charles & Carry & cousin Ellie Yarnall arrived last night or rather this morning, as the boat didnt get in till after 5 o'clock, consequently they were so tired that they are not going to get up till dinner time.  they could not get any state rooms & had to take berths so were very sick.  We took cousin Becky Howell & Annie out riding yesterday afternoon over to the three beaches & had a splendid time & got a good many shells, then in the evening we went out rowing on the bay with Eddie Howell & uncle H (the former makes a pretty good [bean?]) in the moonlight & sought the waves of the steam boats coming in, it was splendid, Lilly tried to row a little, but did not succeed very well.  Tell Aunt Annie I am going to get the story of the Haunted House fresh from Hannah Williams & Lilly or I will write it to her if she wants to know it very badly.  We were very glad to hear that you have cooler weather at home it must have been very hot - (pardonme, mamma) but it is only a slip of the tongue, I have in vain looked for hot in thy letters it's only "excessively warm."  Tell Hazen, Anna says she is going to bring home some shells to him & she wants him to answer her letter to him as soon as possible.  Aunt Mary sends her love & says she thinks she feels a little stronger though she don't attempt to walk far.  Anna wants me to tell Franky that some of the shells she is going to bring him are called boats & if he will put them in water they will float.

  Chellie received thy letter at the dinner table to day, but feels rather disinclined to write in the few minutes we have to spare before going to ride.  We had a fine South West wind yesterday and again to day so that the surf at the bathing beach was first rate this morning.  Charles and Carry, Elly and our party with two ladies from this house made a [load?] for the omnibus and we all enjoyed the sight and sound of the beaches very much, but Henry, Jimmie, Elly, and Lilly, were the only ones to go in.  they had a splendid bath they said.  H. unfortunately is deaf in one ear since and does not feel quite well so I doubt their going in tomorrow unless C. escorts them - and he has the rheumatism - Charly thinks Newport air is all sufficient without bathing.-  H. says I have no time to write as the carriage will be here.  Chelly is quite well, and all the rest.  aff thy sister Mary
  Love to Frank and the children. P.S. Dear Frank - In writing my review which is on hand, I want to make sure of a word I think wrongly used in the book review, and have no dictionary here.  Will thee please look in your Imperial Dictionary, - or the Text of the Iconographic (Anatomical part) & send me word, if found, in your next letter, whether there are not two words, ilium and ileum,

B – 4/11

Dear Mother & sisters,
I think I shall            take to writing to you in a journal form, as I often have            little times when I can sit down for a few minutes & no            longer.  I recd thy letter Carry of the 9th wh. was very            nice & also the cuffs, wh. were also very nice, & I am very            much obliged to whoever did ‘em & that person was mother I            reckon & it was very good of her & they were just what I            wanted. & now if you can only send me a white skirt, I shall            be so [g---] for I can hardly get along without, as I find            the one I brot will hardly bear another washing.
On 4th            day eve. I took tea at Mart. Chestons & had such a nice            time.  Altho’ she is so feeble that she washardly able to sit up all the even, she insisted upon      inviting a few others to make it pleasant for me – & I thot      it was so kind in her. The party consisted of H Lytle (who      is such a nice & good person) Julia Valentine Dr Thomas H.      King & Jesse – & we had such a nice home-like time, & such      an elegant tea & Ice cream & all.  I thought it the nicest      visit I have paid, & then in the evening as it was rainy she      wd. insist upon sending us home in the carriage & she asked      me so kindly to come there any time when I felt like it,      that I felt quite gratified.  It rained so much the      afternoon I was to go out to Careys – that it was deferred      so I have not been yet, & I believe I have’nt done anything      in particular else, since [---] wrote last.  While I think      of it Caroline Ill ans. thy questions. There are 200 chil’n      in our sch. & 4 teachers wh. makes 1 to every 50.  Mine is      the least advanced class & consequently the least      interesting.  Ages, frm. abt, 7 yrs. to 15 or 16. & strange      to say the smallest chil’n in my sch are generally the best      scholars. The greater proportion are boys, about a third      girls. They are children of this place who have not hitherto      had the advantage of free schools.
End of first sitting.3rd day – 18th
I have laid aside my letter for two or      three days, – for we have all felt so sad since hearing the      dreadful news that I cld. not feel like writing abt.      ordinary things & there seemed little to say on the one      great subject – the presidents dreadful death, wh. seemed      dreadful enough to strike every one dumb with horror &      astonishment.  It seemed so near to us, & the more so      because the very day after wh. it occurred we had planned to      make a little excursion to Washington for the day having      been invited by one of Miss M’s frds. who often goes down.       So you can judge of our horror when a few min. before      setting out, this dreadful intelligence was brot. to us. The      feeling here against the seccessionists has been intense as      they have been heard to rejoice in the sts. at thedreadful news, & to have prophesied a few days since that   our rejoicings wld. be turned to sorrow.  The city was under   martial law for a day or two – but by the strict vigilance   of the authorities was kept quiet.  but they compelled every   secessionist as well as union on the principal business sts   to drape their stores in mourning & [if] the appearance it   presents is very solemn & sad.  I suppose it is the same in   Phila. – & everywhere.  It seems really a more horrible   thing than some we have shrunk frm. reading in books of   history.  People here seem to be sanguine about the new   administration – & the prospects of peace, but that does not   take away frm. the horrible fact that there can exist in our   midst such a wicked & fiendish spirit.
4th day morn — our   school has been dismissed to day on account of the   solemnities wh. are to be observed in the churches &   elsewhere
We also had a holliday on 2nd day & Jesse Tyson   very kindly took advantage of it to take us a very beautiful   ride to a lake abt. 7 miles frm. here wh. is situated among   hills & woods as beautiful as any Iever saw.  I had no idea there was anything of the kind so   near to the city.  It was delightful to get a sight of the   beautiful spring in the country.  The trees are just putting   out their first leaves, & look so lovely, & we cld. not but   enjoy it in spite of the mournful circumstances wh. have   been so much in our minds,  Jesse took us past his place,   where he wishes to erect his model house.  It is a very   beautiful situation indeed with views of the city & the bay   &c.
I suppose you (that is some of you) are in the midst   of yearly meeting now. but the sad newsmust have thrown a great damp over every thing.
We have   been spending two or three afternoons this week at the   meeting house sewing for the refugees.  The friends have a   sewing machine there, & meet every day this week to sew.  &   they will get a good deal accomplished no doubt.  Julia   Valentine seems to be very active & is a very nice frd.  I   [am] [you] [will] try to call on [Tamy] Miller when she is   in P again as she — Aunt has been so kind in asking me to   come out there &c.
Clementine Cope.
If you can find   out when [Tamy] will be in P I have no doubt she wld. bring   any package.  I want to go out this morning to get one or   two thins so I will bring my letter to a close.  Hope I   shall get one frm. you today but suppose you have felt   unlike writing as I have.  But for this, I shd. have written   to Tom this week, tell him.  Give my love to Cous. T. & all   enquiring frds. am glad to hear you miss me a little some   times.  Yours affec Clemmy
I miss you very much

My dear Jonnie,

We have not heard from   the crime paper. Edward, however, I happen to know has a   [--] in it, as Mikell used his paper as a model for the   person he secured to read the other papers. This is not   publicinformation, though there is no reason why Edward should not   know. You ought to be proud of that boy. He has not only   done well -- he has done splendidly, and I understand that   either he or his friend Kratz leads the class with higher   marks than we have given in the first year for several   years. Good brains have helped, - but hard steady work has   been the realfactor. Two things gave me special satisfaction; one that I   did not know his handwriting, and the other that I had   marked him higher than anyone else in my subject, writing   across the face of his paper just after reading it: “a Jim   dum dandy man”. 

Father is a great deal better – up   and about. I have just returned from Narragansett. Weather   perfect here.uppose it is also with you. All send   love.

Affectionately

Wm. Draper Lewis

Dear Net,
I have just got thy   letter of the 1st to the 19th inclusive, (where has it been   so long?)  Its very well I did’nt go on with the great scold   I began yesterday — I thot, I wld defer it one day longer &   see – Why I dont believe you know how long you’ve been   neglecting me, & thee must remember while thee’s   journalizing that thy writing every day is’nt my getting   it,.  However it was very interesting if not very late news.   Thee does’nt say a word about having got either of my last   letters,  I hope the one containing my elaborate sketch of   the Environs of the city & my room as a centre, did not get   lost, as it wld. have been a waste of artistic   effort.
The presidents death has indeed made mourning in   our land.  The ways of Providence are very inscrutable.  I   told you in my last letter of the feeling produced here, so   I will notrevert to it..  The day of the funeral procession here was   very solemn.  We dismissed our school, & went by particular   invitation to where we cld. have an excellent view of the   whole as it passed, at the store of an old gentleman in   market st, where we had a room to ourselves & refreshments   provided wh. seemed rather singular but is his custom.  It   was the most touching & mournful procession I ever saw    Perhaps you saw it in Phila.  It will take a long time to   forget the grief & horror of this sad event,– but work has   to be done & yesterday our sch. began [afresh] after the   interruptions of the week before, & while sch. lasts we are   forced to forget every thing but the work before us.  It is   what you might call intense work. & wld. be wearing [--]   [----] [----] if incessant.  Thy description of getting   home, & the nice clean room & all most made me home-sick.  I   miss great many of the little home luxuries and cleannesses   here,– but cannot expect to have them in boarding.  We dont   get any good Mrs [Mcaff--] [----] [butter] &c — excepting   when we get invited out to our rich frds.
I was perfectly   charmed with my visit at Carey’s last 6th day night.  Their   place is perfectly magnificent & the house keeping   altogether princely compared to this.  I went out in the   afternoon & returned next morning.  Their house situated on   the tip top of a [very] hill seems like something up in the   air, & the view splendidSusan Carey has gone to Phil. & expects to return next 7 or   2 day.  She very kindly offered to bring anything for me —   said she wld. have room for any sized bundle, so that I   might get my silk skt.  But it is so late in the season that   I think I can do without it, & I shd. not like to ask her to   bring so large a thing.  I wld. like tho’ to have my old   blk. silk body & I wish thee wld send me a little brown   grenadine bag of horse hair in the right hand corner of my   upper beaureau drawer.  These things however are not very   important, & you need not send them if inconvenient.+    [+Perhaps you can send them by T Miller instead.]  S Carey   stays at Anthony Kimbers cor. 13. & Arch.  I yesterday recd   the skt. sent by Alford Coale for wh. I am much obliged.    Mary Pennyman called yesterday & was very pleasantLizzie Hopkins of the house where Lizzie Edge, Jenny Harris   &c staid, called to see me also, & some Matthews wh. lives   in the country said Lizzie E had written to her that I was   here & that she intended to invite me out to her place in   the country, a very pleasant one I understand.  A gentleman   called here night before last — Miller M Kim whom you have   perhaps heard of — one of the Freedmens board in Phila. &   [----] me a message frm. Cous. Frank whom he had seen the   day before.  Tho’ a stranger he seemed quite like somebody   from home.  To night I am going with H Lytle to the frds.   bible class, meeting at Dr. Thomas’ — it is attended by   frds. mostly, altho’ Ellen Carey who is an episcopalean &   one or two others attend.  They say it is very interesting,   tho’ I have’nt been before.  A few days ago I went to hear   Thomas Beecher a (brother of H Wards) speak, but was   disappointed, as it was nothing very interesting.     I cld.   not make out by thy journal exactly when your visit to Aunt   C’s began or ended, but am glad you had a nice time.  Give   my love to them & tell them I hope they’ll ans. my note.    Love also to Cous. F & M.  You were quite enterprising to   walk up to Athensville.  I am going to try & write to Tom

My dear Annie, 

It   seems to me that a very improper time has elapsed since the   receipt of they welcome letter, without my having answered   it - but as we are both well hosted in excuses I will not   add to the list.- Just as I began my letter, thy kind note   was handed me - & I truly thank thee for it and should love   to comply with they request - but [dont] see that it would    be possible. Besides dearie I want thee to come here - and   hope to persuade thee to do so.- Your place must indeed   looklovely & I have thought several times how I should like   to look uponits beauty and enjoy your society - which is always so   pleasant, but I must deny myself this time- I want too, to   hear about the wedding & Clemmy & diverse other things. Our   “Strawberry Company” as thee calls it, is not here- tho we   have had several of our friends the past week, - and shall   probably have more [next]. - - Our cook had gone away for a   fortnights visit, half of the time is gone - at which I   rejoice, and this is another reason why I cannot leave home-   the next week father and mother will be away for a Sundays-   and after that I do hope thee will come to see me. Any day   that suits thee we shall gladly welcome thee. - 

I   heard from Deborah Thomas that Clemmy was pleasantly   situated and like her occupation.- Thee must miss her visits   very much & she thine. - Lily seemsquite absented in her work and is turning out a very      managing young lady - it will probably be of great use to      her in calling out her latent energies.- 

How many      remarkable & [steming]  events have transpired since we were      together.- It seems to me we have, every day, reason to      mourn death of our own dear good President -  Johnson is so      different - & if he should get us into a Mexican war it      would be so sad. But we can but hope for the best. Was it      not wonderful how suddenly & completely the Rebellion cam to      an end. Like the “One hoss slay”- it all broke down at      once.- Poor Jeff makes a sorry figure in his humiliation he      is showing very plainly what a poor miserable specimen  of a      man he was.- Niether true courage or honor in the slightest      appreciative of his great crimes. -- We have justhad our Bettie at home for ten days and busy enough we were   with her spring clothing - she comes back again the last of   next month for vacation.- She is growing so companionable   that I miss her when she is gone very much.-
I am glad to   hear Uncle D B Smith sometimes gets to your house. no doubt   it does him good. Wish I could see him. Will thee give him   my love when thee see him.- Suppose Uncle John & Aunt R   Smith & cos Lizzie are out in the broad Ocean. we hear our   cousin Richard Howland was to go with them, but do not know   if its true. If aunt R’s health is improved - it will be   delightful for them all to be together. Would thee not like   to go if thee could do so properly? - I should exceedingly,   but probably never shall, my life seems destined to be very   unadventurous and matter of fact, - all for the best no   doubt.- Do Lilly & her Philip’slive in Germantown? What a favored place you live in all the  nice people do mostly congregate there. R wishes to be  remembered to thee & hopes sometime to accept the very kind  invitation. Just now I [----] [------] are all engrossing. -  I hope thy father is pretty well this spring please remember  me to him.- With much love I am very truly thee thee  at[----] 
S. S. Reeve

I hope thee has not got any  of those little salt sellars yet, as I have has a pair  waiting for thee ever so long, Will send them down next week  if I can. -

Dear Tom,
Thee must excuse   me for having been so long answering thy letter, & not think   that I did not care about it, for I was right pleased that   thee wrote to me, & I have said to myself ever so many times   [said] that I must write to that “Little “Toms”—  but thee   sees now I have got to be a school mistress, I have so many   cares that I cant always do[o] what I’d like & then I have   had a good many letters to write to different people &   knowing that thee saw the home ones & knew all about me, I   took it the easier.
I have now been “school”mom=’en” long   enough to get a prety good idea of the business – & my idea   of it is, thatits a good deal easier to be a scholar than I teacher, – so   thee can remember that for thy comfort when thee has a hard   lesson to learn.  To teach a school of troublesome boys I   shd. say was one of the hardest businesses’s that cld. well   be got up..  The girls are bad enough, but when it comes to   boys – – they’re the [---] of man.  I have in my school   about 35 boys & a dozen girls between the ages of 6 & 15 —   The girls I have but little trouble with, but the little   boys are regular monkeys.  No sooner is my back turned than   they begin their discussions of wh. they have a variety —    Its the hardest thing in the world to keep them still, & if   they get a good chance there’s not one of them that is too   good to get up & takea dance or a fight or any other such little amusement that   they think will set the school in an uproar.+  [+ Throwing   spit balls is a very bad habit they have – also dancing “Ham   fat”]  My punishments are various.  Sometimes I shake the   culprit & if that wont do, tie em up hand & foot & put em in   the corner — wh. is a very troublesome operation to me.  But   it seems as if nothing wld. beat it into their heads that   school is any thing but a place to play in.  
Most of   them can read a little some not at all, & like “Busy” – they   must always spell girl gril and dirt – drit –.  It seems as   if it came natural —  One of their best accomplishments is   singing wh. we sometimes let them do in school.  My children   know “my”native country thee” & the colored “Wolunteer”— wh.   they shout out with great effect. But I guess I’ve told thee   enough about the darkies  We’ll talk a little abt.the whites.  How comes on work at Haverford?  By the way thy   hand writing is coming on so well, that when I got thy   letter I thot. it was Busy’s himself, it was so good.    Have’nt you a boy named Allen Thomas,?  I expect he’s a nice   fellow & has two very nice brothers whom I met last eveng.    There are [---] pleasant frieds here & I do not often have a   chance to feel lonely or home sick.  How does Prof. Cope &   his botany lectures?  I am going to try to write him a note   to send in this & consequently must say farewell or shall   not have time.  Thee can take this down home with thee next   7th day & tell ‘em it’s all they’ll get this week.— as they   dont deserve any for some time.  Give my love to all, & if   thee gets time write again to thy affec sister C

Rockview Cottage
6 mo 4th 1864 –

My dear   Anne,

From cloud land do I now address thee it has   been raining, raining for days – but we cannot wish it   otherwise as it will raise the mountain springs which were   beginning to fail rapidly it has been rather an anxious care   with us to watch the springs for fear they would give out   before the cisterns were prepared to save the water and the   steam pumps were fixed so that the pure water might be   available for the sick in the Hospitals there are but about   500 patients now but it is hoped that the large field   Hospital at Chattanooga may soon be moved up here and   probably two thirds of the patients that would otherwise die   might recover I think there had been but four deaths since   the Hospital was established here  The air is so fine and   the water runningthrough sand stone rocks the sweetest that could be and I   sometimes think the patients would recover without medicine   –  Several patients extremely ill with pneumonia have lived   although Dr H said they must die –
When it does clear I   expect we shall have one of these magnificent cloud scenes –   Sunshine and blue sky above whilst below us a billowy sea of   clouds looking as if they were frozen as they formed –  I   imagine it must look precisely like an Artic sea –  We have   witnessed two such scenes when it had been raining heavily –   the whole valley completely hid except about half way up the   Mountain –  Anna Harlow is describing some of the cloud   scenes we have had beautifully alluded to the psalm where   they are so grandly described and which we can appreciate   from having witnessed the clouds in their grandeurabove and below us as well as like the present time we have   been for days enveloped in the thick clouds –  "The waters   stood above the mountains At Thy rebuke they fled – at the   voice of thy thunder they hasted away –  They go up by the   Mountains they go down by the valleys unto the place which   thou hast founded for them –  He watereth the hills from his   chambers" &c–  There are many beautiful scenes so much so   that I could not picture them to thee –  I know thee would   enjoy many of the views that are on every hand, not only   from their beauty but from the historic interest that even   now induces people by hundreds to come up the Mountain to   see the celebrated "Lookout" and the scenes in the valley   below us –  I never was at a more charming place I think –    The other day some ladies from Philada. Ellen Parrish sister   to Robert A Parrish and Dr Janney’s daughter spent two days   at our house (and rather inconveniently,two nights as we were obliged to give up our room and our   husbands had to sleep on the floor –  they had come on a   mission of relief to E Tennessee refugees and had become   acquainted with the Commander of the post Col Culver who   offerred them facilities to go to the Lake and Falls about   six miles distant –  Lewis & myself accompanied the party –    It was a scene of rare beauty –  The Falls are not large but   very high and fall in shimmering spray down the most   beautiful rocks –  It seemed to me as though every thing had   been brought to bear to make the place charming  The rocks   of various hues and shaded seemed cut into the most   picturesque forms whilst the clear mountain stream came over   its clean and clear rocky bed & went down the precipice to   the height of 125 feet –  Another face below us which we   could discover by the Mist we did not get to visit –The slopes were covered with Rhodedendron of very large   flower and Laurels and the [Fringe] tree growing wild –  We   came away reluctantly and all of us thought I have no doubt   that we either would visit it again or would more than ever   desire to do so –  The next day being First day our   neighbours Dr Ridgleys who had been up but a few days   started to go there on horseback there were six of them one   of the party told me that she went feeling rather afraid   that it was not right – they had got quite a distance beyond   the pickets and they must have been very near the Falls I   judge when as they were a little off the roadside resting   off their horses they saw a man dressed in Rebel uniform,   grey cloth and brass buttons passed right by them [leading]   his horse and did not take notice of them – one of the   gentlemen called after him after he passed – "My kind sir   where do you belong?" he repliedat General Thomas’ Headquarters.  They all believed him to   be a rebel officer and as he had a large revolver and they   were unarmed he could have captured the whole of them – they   were pretty much frightened and concluded to turn their   horses heads homeward and did not see the Falls – so much   for their pleasure party on First day –  In speaking of it   it was remarked that sometimes our scouts go dressed in   Rebel uniform – it might have been one of them –  There is   another very beautiful place called "Rock City"–  The brow   of this Mountain is crowned with soft kind of Rocks which   look as if some day had been washed and rounded by water   covering them –  Geologists would say they had –  At Rock   City these rocks cover the ground, at one place like a town   and at another we walked over them and gathered the most   beautifullichens and mosses x_, red green & drab, [x  with most   remarkable fissures & clefts all through them] I only wish   we could send you some specimens –  I think we might by   "Adams Express" sometime before we go away when the   facilities [of] transportation are more available than they   are here at present there have been some moms gathered and   sent to the different Fairs for the benefit of the Sanitary   Com. as well as lots of Canes–  The roots of the Laurel are   very hard and beautifully grained large quantities are dug   and articles made of them as mementoes of the place –  Our   Ben has quite a lot which the soldiers gave him when they   went to the Front – which he sells as well as canes to   increase his fortune –
Thee may be very sure that I was   much gratified upon receiving thy kind little note –  I had   not forgotten my promise to write to thee but supposing thee   often heard from us through my Children I did not know   whetherthee cared particularly about my writing added to which I   rather feel averse to tell the same thing over again –   although there is not any lack of incident here –  We have   been living very quietly here the past three months –  We   have had some acquisitions to the place lately but need not   feel alarmed at their being very extensive, without people   build for themselves or live in tents –  As I raise my eyes   I see the tents of Major Mc’Michael and one or two others in   the woods at one side of us – they look very pretty – he is   Adjat to Gen Thomas – is the son of Morton McMichael of   Philada. on the other side is the cottage of Dr Ridgley   Medical Purveyor with two ladies boarding with them and Capt   Edwards from Penn Wife & daughter who board with one of the   old residents are all the Society here except ourselves A   part of an Engineer Brigade about600 men the Officers Hospital of 100 men and convalescents   of the number of 400 are all that live here except three or   four families who have remained through all and are entirely   dependent for provision for what they can purchase through   exchange –  They sell their milk at from 50 cts to $1.00 per   gal eggs 75 cts per doz butter 75 cts per lb and have been   getting in exchange from us flour at 3 1/2 cts per lb sugar   14 cts per lb –  They charge for butter milk 75 & 80 cts per   gal and can get it readily as it is so desirable for the   sick –
I have often recurred to the time I spent at your   house last Spring when I was with you in sympathy by the   Suffering bed of thy dear Mother –  I never witnessed such   suffering and I never recur to it perhaps but with Something   of the tender feelingsthat then pervaded my heart –  I dare say thee often feels   lonely without her dear Anne – but no doubt thee thinks that   thy loss is her gain and that she would not wish to exchange   her bliss in Heaven for any earthly thing – there was a   great deal that was pleasant and sweet that she left below –   Many that have the tastes to enjoy the beautiful could not   have them gratified like the inmates of such a home as you   have but with it all I often felt sorrowful that dear sister   was deprived of the use of her eyes which to me would have   been terrible – but all things have been ordered aright we   cannot doubt –  I would be very glad to hear from thee as   often as thee feels like writing to thy absent but not the   less interested and affectionate 
Aunt Martha –
Please   give my love to Father and all the inmates of your home –

Bristol July 13. 1771 – 7th day 1 oClock
My dear   Sister

My Henry came here last evening in seeming   good spirits but indifferent Health; he eat a very light   supper, and sett off this morning (after a poor breakfast)   about 8 oClock.  He has a fine day, and I hope riding and   relaxation from business will restore him; he talked of   returning to Bristol on 5th day or perhaps not untill 7th   day next.  Thy continued Confinement and constant care give   me many an anxious minute; but I trust the time will come   when it may please kind Providence to make things easier to   thee.  I was not quite so well yesterday as usual & my dear   Henrys coming to me so unwell gave me pain.  I am quite   bravely to day after coming out of the water but full of   thought about my dear little crowing Henry.  Doct. D.*   [*Denormandie] came here last evening, and, after the usual   salutation, said to me, he was come to have some serious   talk with me; I smiled; nay said he I am in earnest; about   what Doctor? – weaning your little son; such a hearty   growing boy, who seems to live upon you, is enough to draw a   pain in a weakly person, where there had never been one   before; besides he keeps you waking at nights, and prevents   your using means that might restore you; if it was not on   his account you might now go with Mr. Drinker to the sea   shore, and so forth.  There are several women here who I   beleive have put it into the Doctors head that I ought not   to suckle the Child.  My Henry seconded him, and said he   would write this morning to thee, but as he was poorly, I   undertook to do it.–  Do not think my dear, from what I have   written, that I am worse; Indeed I am not through mercy, but   have had the pain in my breast oftener than I had sometime   ago, which I told the Doctor.  I beleive that if I had a   Girl with me that was worth a fig, it would be different,   for the one I have has no knack of making the Child fond of   her.  Doctr. D. says as Doctr. Evans knows my Constitution,   he would have him spoken to. –  I would have thee see the   Doctor and talk with him.  Patty would do a great deal   better than the Girl I have, and should she offer again, I   would not have thee entirely discourage her, but tell her   thee beleives the girl I have does not suit me, and if she   thinks she can behave so as to please me, thee would have   her call again.  It will be time enough (after theehas spoken to Doct. Evans) to come to any conclusion when my   Henry returns.  I had a room full of visitors yesterday   afternoon; two Chariotts full besides others; T. Ringold &   Wife from Maryland; Sally Hoffman, Sukey Pintard, her sister   Boudinott from New York; Serlis’ wife, Betsy Tilghman from   Philada. and Billy Coxe’s daughter, and Sally Tredwell the   Doctors sister.  We all went in the evening to Bath.  I go   but little a visiting, and they all think that my little   dear keeps me at home, and every ones cry is wean him, wean   him; thee would be charmed to see the dear little fellow,   how he daily improves in cunning antick tricks.  I long to   see thee and my dear Children, but dont know how to bring it   about.  My Henry was saying that he was well pleased that I   did not get his letter by Billy Hodge (as he had mentioned   thy being unwell) as thee is now better. – I would have thee   my dear take half a spoonful of the Elixir every day to   strengthen thee.  I have not had occasion to take any since   I came up as yet, but thee knows it was of great use to me   taken in small quantity.  I have been but a little while   writing thus far, but as I have not stopped since I began, I   grow tired, and my dear little one is crying for me; My dear   love is to thee & to my sweet Children, to whom I intend to   write when I can conveniently; they must not be impatient,   but good and kind to each other, & very dutiful & mindful of   their Aunty’s will, which will give great pleasure to their   very affectionate mammy
I am, my dear Sister, thine &c   –
E. Drinker

My dear, dear, kind Henry looked so   unwell as he slept this morning as made my heart ache; he   was last night more than commonly chearful, which I have   observed often to be the case when he is unwell.  how unlike   the generality of Mankind is he in his natural disposition   many ways.  he was last night at supper affectionately   acknowledging thy tender care of him, & saying how clever it   was to have two Wives.  We were likewise wishing that it was   convenient to thee to spend one month here, free from care   of us & ours. –  I hope it may please God to spare me and   restore me to health for my Henrys sake, & that I may be   enabled to make up in some measure to my dear Husband and   Sister their many, many kindnesses to me; but shouldshould it happen otherwise, may I be enabled to say, the   Lords will be done. –

5 oClock – Billy Parr has been   here; he says he saw thee, & that you are all well.  he has   gone to Trenton, where Peggy, Nancy and Caleb are to go   tomorrow; they want me to go, but I shall not.  Molly Foulke   is expected here this evening or in the morning.  Mag.   Divine next second day, so that we shall have the house   full.  Peggy gives her love to thee.  Henry’s asleep, & I am   going to Bath.  farewell my dear Sister for the   present.
E.D.
I wrote yesterday by S. Le Gay, which   letter I suppose thee has received.  I make no doubt but my   dear Henry will return bravely.  tomorrow will be a lonesome   day to me.  my love to neighbour James –

B 6/7—65—

Dear Mother & sister Annte.

I think   I’ll address you collectively this time, as I suppose   Caroline’s head’ll be turned with weddings & unable to   appreciate common topics. I recd. yr. very interesting &   spirited epistles this morn.g & reply at once, in order that   you may not have cause to complain of remissness this time,   & upon what ground you did it last, I must say I cld. not   discover, as I think I have been up to the mark quite as   much as you have. Thy remarks [a] on properness &c were   quite edifying. I expect thee wd. be charmed with the   Baltimore people. They are certainly most social & charming   in their manners, tho’ I dont believe afterall, when you come to the foundation of things that there is   any more good substantial material among them than among   some of that despised class denominated "the proper." As to   the gentlemen I cant say that I have met any whom I consider   very deeply interesting As far as gallantry & politeness go   they are certainly very attractive Bt if we cld. only   introduce a little more of these elements with some of our   [imperturbables] I incline to think these wld. be found   quite as deep in the long run. I must say it is refreshing   to get hold of some thing that is more [impressible] than a   stone & I intend to [---] up Baltimore ways loudly when I   get home. Tell Cousin Mary she must hurry & come down as   fast as she can, or I fearI shall not get to have my sprees with her. This morn the   new teacher who is going to take my sch. arrived & I was   promoted or depressed I dont know wh. to the rank of   assistant to Mr Waterman, the principal of the sch. It is a   splendid change for me, as his room is much pleasanter & I   have none of the discipline to do but only the hearing of   the lessons—intellectually, it seems a most magnificent   advance frm. a-b only to geography and arithmetic & I shd.   be quite willing to teach there for weeks if it was’nt for   the hot weather, as it is, however, considering the [--] &c   I think I had better not stay much after the three months   are up wh. will be abt. the mid of June--& very soon—as you   will perceive, so you may make preparations for me, soon   after that time—I hope you’ll havepleasant little surprise prepared for me in the way of a   closet—wh. wont be the linen closet—I have to keep up such   an everlasting foolding and unfolding here that I shall be   perfectly delighted to get a place to "hang up" in.

I   expect I am indebted to my frd. Jesse for this release frm.   the infants—I said to him in joke some time ago that I thot,   I shd. give "notice" soon for them to get another teacher &   he took it in earnest but I am very glad, on some accts, as   I shd like to get some ideas about older teaching frm Mr.   W.

I expect you’ll enjoy [Mr. N’s] wedding most as   much as Lilly’s—There was a young gentleman here the other   day who told somebody that he thot L’s wedding was   dreadfully stupid, & that he thot’ one or two of the   bridesmaids (he did’nt say all) were the ugliest girls he   had ever seen—not a very complimentary speech I think.
As I shall probably come home so soon it will not be worth   while to send the things by express—tho’ if I cld only have   had them now they wld. have been exceedingly useful -- I   think maybe I’ll try & get myself a beige skt. here & we   shall not be likely to have many more tea parties now the   warm weather has come -- We’ve never heard any more abt.   Jessies strawberry party & we’re afraid he’s forgotten it.   He took us to a small one out at his bro. James’ night   before last. We went in a buggy & pair & came home by   moonlight—quite romantically -- The buggy is only used on   very romantic occasions, I believe. Its so nice here   moonlight nights—the ladies all dress up in their whites &   sit out on the front door steps, & go round [seeing?] one   another with beaux or beau less just as it happens.Has Fanny Drinker gone home? I reckon she has & where is   Cous. Sarah? Give my love to her if she is about still. I   ought to have written to her. Give my love also to all the   Wynndowners also please give my love & congratulations to   all the bride cousins & tell them I’m very sorry not to be   giving them anything-- Maybe if I aint so lazy I’ll make em   something after I get home. But dont tell em that. I believe   this is all I have to say at present—will write and fix the   day of course before I come. If Cous. M. comes soon please   send the shawl and the [b----] skt. as I [---] much love to   all—yrs. affec

Mr Arndt on whom I depended for [the]   Hemlock Bark Has not yet ground it but I hope He will attend   to it shortly–  if it in any degree succeeds [in] England it   will be Highly important to this Count[r]y as well as   convenient to ship overseas–  I beleive that the mak[ing]   pot & pearl Ash might prove an advantageous thing to us more   than to any other persons [We] owning the nearest Large Body   of suitable timber for the purpose – if it will pay for its   mak[ing] & a reasonable sum for outlay & superintendance it   will answer us as a means of clear[ing] Land –
I am glad   that thy mind is made up for a peep at this quarter of the   world – I think it will be likely to be beneficial to thy   Health as also to Aunts – Some Rough travell[ing] there will   no doubt be – but generaly speak[ing] the Roads are   tolerable to the mouth of Tunkhannock–  Thereare no excelent Taverns on the Route so far as I am   acquainted–  I think the one Here is the Best & likely to be   the most pleasant for the Residence of aunt–  Gentlemen can   be well accomodated at Easton & at Wilkes barre at Mr Whites   in the first nammed place & at Mr Arndts in the second in   Both Houses there is Rather too much noise and Drink[ing] to   be entirely agreeable to Ladies –  Here also we have more   noise than is pleasant–  There be from 15 to 20 of Stoddarts   work[ing] hands quart[ere]d in the House –  
The Road by   Easton is Rather worse than that by Bethlehem & Nazareth & I   think generaly the accommodations are better on this last   Route–  from Nazareth to Hellers at the Wind gap at which   House I have generaly procured tolerable Eating & pretty   clean–  from thence about 17 miles to William Sox’s upon the   top of Pokono – where th[e]y make prety good coffee & give   you what ever they may Have in the House in a tolerably   cleanly stile–  from thence to this place say 12 miles   –
The present is about as pleasant a Time to Travel in   this county as any other Dur[ing] the summer – ere the grain   is cut which will not be Done before the Last of next monthHowever the Weather is now variable and we may expect   occasional Rains, until after Harvest – 
in the Last of   August & to the middle of September is generaly more settled   weather – as to the [Gnats] they Have already come & in the   woods Bite sharply–  This [they] will continue to Do until   September – But out of the woods we do not find them   Troublesome– There are not any curiosities worthy a name   from Philada to this place–  The Habits & manners of the   people on the Route may perhaps afford Something novel – The   scenery also & general Aspect of the County will be new –   [marbly] nature in Her Roughest garb will surround you – you   will have pure Air & pure water & I doubt not to good   [appetites] as to enable you to Encounter much coarser fare   than usual – in the neighbourhood of Easton-Bethlehem &   Nazareth is a lime stone county – & I would have you beware   of the water – it is no doubt wholesome but to persons   [unaccustomed] to it it is often unpleasant in its effects–   if I know when you intend com[ing] up I will endeavor to   join you at Hellers – I have been constantly interupted   since I began writing which must excuse this   scrawl–

<br   My dear Friend,
When I received thy very welcome letter,   & the handsome volumes which accompanied it, I felt once   more that strong desire, which often stirs me, to visit   America, & to see again those dear friends who, nearly   thirty years ago, received me there with such unbounded   kindness.  Some of these have passed away, but a few are   left, and of these thou, my dear friend, with thy good   Brotherand your dear Wives, are kept in very cherished remembrance.   So it was delightful to get thy letter, & since its receipt   I have spent several hours in reading, with great interest,   this excellent Life of your great President.  How it has   recalled the old days!  I have gone over so much that had   lain dormant so long, & am more than ever impressed with   Lincoln’s marvellous development from his miserable early   surroundings. How could any man so outlive his environment?    And who could have believed that any man with such aparentage, & such debasing influences around him in early   life, could, by any innate power, or any outward   circumstance, become the great man Lincoln proved himself   later on.  We are slow to learn God’s lesson that He chooses   his instruments very differently to ourselves.
So far as   I can test Mr. Morse’s accuracy, he is very just; neither   hiding Lincoln’s shortcomings nor wishful to make out “a   case,” pro or con, but to act judicially.  I hope to give   our Workpeople an hour’s talk this Winter, based largely   upon this interesting Biography.Thanks for thy kind message to Agnes & the [baines].  All   are well.  How I wish they could see thee in the flesh, for   they often hear thee quoted, and are familiar with thy face,   through the Portrait which is hung, with Uncle Smith   Harrison’s, in our Library – the much valued gift of thy   good son, Hazen – to whom please give my love.
I trust   you are all well: it would be a real pleasure to see you all   again, but, at present, I see no chance of getting away.    With our united love to all our friends at Awbury, I   am,
Thine, very sincerely

2nd day eve
190 Calvert st

Dear Mother & sisters,   Tired as I am I must write you a few words to night, as I   shall probably be at the sch, in the morn & the mail closes   at 1 P.M. & I thought you’d like to know that we arrived   safely about 5 this aft. & I am installed in my new boarding   house wh. promises to be very nice.  They ladies were   exceedingly kind & welcomed me as if I had been an old   friend  They are so free & easy.  One of them Miss Talbot   came right up in my room & talked to me while I was getting   dressed – & was as kind as possible  They used to know uncle   Jasper & quantities of our friends, so that I begin to feel   quite at home already  It is a large 4story house with a very nice pleasant parlor, & a   comfortable dining room, where we had tea on a little   refreshment table—the 4 school “marms”—as cozy as possible.    They say “thee” & call me by name wh. makes me feel much   less strange
Jesse called a few minutes after we arrived   in his elegant carriage, having been to one of the dipots to   meet us, but we unfortunately had got out at the wrong one;   & very much out of our way.  The ladies seem in very   moderate circumstances only keeping one servant, & a sch. of   near 40 day scholars.   consequently they have not much time   to attend to housekeeping nor much talent in that way I shd.   think.  Their kindness however makes amends.The house is on a very high situation & there is a fine view   of the city fr[m]. my room, wh is in the 2nd story & very   airy & pleasant.  But there is no closet unfortunatley wh.   is remarkably home like & seems to be my fate.  Not a place   to hang a dress, but I have 5 beaureau drawers & can make   out.  So much for the house.  3rd day morn.  We went last   evening to see the sch. & I was most agreeably disappointed   in it in every respect..  The rooms are well ventilated &   airy & no disagreeable odour.  & their state of advancement   is surprising.  There were a few to be sure who reminded me   of Busy—in his attempt to spell girl—but mostly they were   astonishingly quick--& cld. add & subtract like quite   accomplished arithmeticaians.  Quite as fast as I cld.   myself.  They were mostly adults.  In the morningThey are children.
I am to have a class of 30 & am very   glad to find that I shall be in the school with Miss Field,   who is a very pleasant young lady about my own age I shd.   judge, & we can go backwards & forward to gether, & shall be   companionable I hope.  The morning session is frm. 9 till 1   1/2 not 3.  The evening teaching you can take part in or not   as you choose.  So it will not be very laborous & in every   respect, it is going to be I think, much pleasanter than I   had anticipated.  & if you are only satisfied I think I can   be very comfortable & enjoy the work & the change.Love to Cousin Sarah.

Sept. 17th. 1862.

Dear Chellie, 
I have been      waiting for news, before answering your last letter and am      now not much better off, but you write such very short      letters that I am not at all conscientious about making mine      short also.  I wish my dear, that you would make your      letters a little longer, & if you do not you will see mine      gradually decreasing in length, till there is hardly any      letter at all.  Uncle James went off to Harrisburg on Monday      as did Uncle Clem George Emlen John Thayre (my cousins) and      Cousin George Biddle.  Uncle Clem never told a soul that he      was going and on Sunday night when John went to the      Baltimore depot to see Gerge Emlen and John Thayre off to      his surprise he saw Uncle Clem.He was going off without bidding us good-bye when perhaps we      may never see him again.  He always was very queer but this      beats every thing.  Is not the war news splendid?  I have      not been so glad since the battle of Drainsville,      particularly about Howell Cobb the old traitor.  There is      now not the slightest fear of our having Stonewall Jackson      in Philadelphia but I pity the poor citizens of Cincinnati.       Cousin Sam Cox was called to a churchthere (St. Paul’s) and he accepted.  He left town two weeks      from yesterday and when he arrived at Cincinnati he was not      allowed to enter the city but was sent to a boarding house      about two miles from the city.  There he is now with his      wife children and father.  Of their furniture they know      nothing and are not allowed to go to the city to see about      it.  Every morning at five o’clock all the bells in the town      ring and every man who is able to carry a gun assembles in      some perminent place and from thence they go out into the      country to wait for the enemy.  Even clergymen are forced to      fight & Cousin Sam is in almost hourly fear of being made to      serve.  I received a letter from Martha Henderson just now.They are at present in Wiesbaden and Martha says that if her      relations were with her she would never again wish to leave      there, not even for America.  That I cannot understand for      no place can or will ever be the same to me as dear      Philadelphia.  But I am forgetting my determination to make      my letter short and although I am burning to go on I deny      myself for your good as I think a little correction will be      very beneficial to you so I will sign myself y
your ever      loving and for long letters begging friend

Title: 1818 November 20, Stoddartsville, to Thomas P. Cope Esq., Philadelphia

Thomas P. Cope
Stoddartsville November 20th   1818.
Respected Uncle,
From Father from Wm Drinker &   from B.[T]. Case I have understood that Susquehanna County   Has recd from thee a recent visit & also that our   Philadelphia & Great Bend Turnpike was not without interest   in thy sight–
That this Road Should be deemed of   importance By thee & yet not through my representations of   its incalculable Value affords me much pleasure–  Directly   Interested in it myself & anxious by every Honest means to   ensure its success  Still there were insurmountable   objections to my endeavoring to influence Thee in its   promotion–  I hope I need not explain from whence these   objections proceeded – they are inseparable from the History   of my life & my powers of Memory–
On the 14th I proceeded   to Wilkes barre in order to See Mr Henry Clymer- Thomas   Meredith & others and to definitively establish the Route of   our Turnpike – also to nominate Commissioners & to Petition   the Legislature–  without Know[ing] who would or would not   Serve in Philada we nominated the following subject to   alterations if necessary–
Thomas Stewardson – Thomas P   Cope – John Reed – Condy Raquet, Benjamin R Morgan & John   Gibson – for Philada–
Henry Clymer – Henry W Drinker & Wm   Clark – for Luzerne–
Isaac Ryneerson – Thomas Meredith –   Wm Ward & B[T] Case – for Susquehan[a]
A New Route Had   been Explored By Mr B[T] Case to the Westward several miles   of the one contemplated & Explored for Thomas Stewardson –   shorter in distance & less Hilly than the [first] & far more   interesting to thy Estate on the Meshoppen–
after   minutely examining the apparent advantages of the two   Routes. I gave my assent to adopting the one last explored &   Our Petition was Drawn in conformity thereto–
For want of   a Better map of Common Reference I must make use of Reading   Howells map of Pennsylvania to carry to thee an Idea of the   Route though from the incorrectness of it our Road will   appear more crooked than it will be eventualy found–
Our   Road begins at One Matts Tavern on the Coskectune and Great   Bend Turnpike Towards the Head of Salt [Lick] Creek – where   the Road from Tyoga Point crosses the said Turnpike –    Thence across the Milford & Owego Turnpike – & thence   between Martins Creek & the North Branch of the Tunkhannock   Creek–Thence across the South Branch of the same – & Thence   through Leggets Notch (or Gap) in the Lackawannock Range of   mountains [Formed by Leggets creek a small stream pretty   into the Lackawannock about 15 miles from the Susquehannah   according to Reading Howells map & scale] then across the   East & West Road at one Swartz Tavern – & then across   Roaring Brook or Deep Hollow Creek – Thence nearly Parralel   with the Same to the main Branch of the Lehigh River–    Thence S. 10 E across Tobyhanna Creek & its Branches to the   Sullivans Road & thence by the East End of the Large Pond to   the Turnpike Road on the top of the Pokono mountain at or   near the 30 mile stone from Wilkesbarre–  The whole Distance   Being from Point to point as Explored & measured about Fifty   Three miles – & the Estimated Expence $1000 per mile–  Our   Petition asks the Legislature to incorporate a company with   a capital of $75,000 – but entre nous this is but a [Ruse de   Guerre]–
I do not pretend (from my imperfect knowledge of   the precise situation of thy lands upon the Meshoppen) to be   able to say How far thy interest may be advanced by the   completion of this Road But that it will be more or less   appears evident and plain –  That the Whole of Susquehanna   County – a Part of Luzerne Co. & a part of Pike will feel   its Blessings is not to be denied–  Neither I think will it   be doubted that the Road is interesting to parts of   Northampton – Bucks & Montgomery counties & as will be shown   Peculiarly Interesting to the City & county of   Philadelphia–
We have called it The Philadelphia & Great   Bend Turnpike & with good reason.- it forming the most   Important Link in the chain of communication & the only one   wanting to secure to Philadelphia incalculable advantages–    From the Pokono a good Turnpike Road now Exists (not Log   Turnpike) to the Wind Gap & from thence [are] two good   county Roads to Easton – on to Bethlehem by the way of   Nazareth – or to Janets Bridge in Lower Saucon where a   Turnpike Road is laid out – then by good Roads to either the   Willow Grove or Germantown Turnpikes  to the City of   Philada–.  We might Have called our Turnpike The   Counteracting Turnpike – it being the Only one Ever   projectedcalculated (By Intersecting the Turnpikes Leading to the   City of New York in important points) to counteract the   Influence that City by Her Liberallity Her Geographical   Wisdom and foresight in despight of natural obstructions –   Has obtained–
There is One advantage which will result to   Philada from this Road which (amongst many others) I select   Because it will reach the comprehension of Every man & is   capable of undeniable proof & is indeed Known to very many   persons in Bussiness in Philadelphia–  I speak now of the   Cattle Trade or the Driving of Horned Cattle Sheep & Horses   to the Philadelphia market–  I shall speak of such Facts as   are Known to me – some of which are Known to our Dry good   merchants – some to our Graziers and all to the Drovers   themselves–
The persons Engaged in this Trade are nearly   to a man Store Keepers from the state of New York–  They   receive cattle sheep & Horses in payment for various   merchandize sold by them to farmers in their vicinity.  Or   purchase them with the monies they Receive for their goods–    Their Best market for these cattle is found at Philadelphia   & notwithstanding the circuitous Route they are obliged to   take & the most miserable & wretched Roads which alone Exist   to this market they Drive Annualy cattle sheep & Horses to   the amount of One million of Dollars– (I [think] this season   of Horned cattle alone that near if not quite 1/2 a million   of Dollars in value Has passed By this place & through the N   & South Road  at least I am persuaded that I may rely on the   account I have Received of the number) – if then it be a   fact that near one million of Dollars in cattle sheep &   Horses reaches Philadelphia Every year from the State of New   York and that for want of a Road from Philada- to the   Western part of that state – the whole Sum is Drawn in cash   from Philada and goes to the City of New York & there is   Expended in the purchase of Merchandize Because of good   waggon Roads Connecting that City with the Said western part   of the State – will it not be apparent thatOur Road in Truth is a Philadelphia Turnpike & well Worthy   the Patronage & Support of every liberal minded Citizen–    But that this is the fact Every Drover will admit & I   beleive that they will very generaly declare that they would   much rather purchase their merchandize in Philadelphia than   in New York if it were possible to waggon [their] goods   through Pennsylvania to their Homes–  at least this is the   Sentiment expressed to me as far as I have conversed with   them – in addition Then to these facts – I may state That   Though Cattle forms perhaps a principal Remittance from   Store Keepers in the Western pt of N York–  Yet it is not   the only One – a good deal of Cash also is brought Down by   these persons & this cash also goes to the City of New York   which would if our Road was made Remain in Philada–
I may   State too without fear of contradiction that this Cattle   Trade in despight of Obstacles Has constantly & rapidly   increased that in spight of them it will increase & that if   nothing is done to Counteract the Evil we shall still   continue to pay to the City of New York for the Beef we Eat   – or in other words that the Philadelphia merchant. shall   continue to pay the New York merchant for the whole amount   of cattle Driven from this quarter to Philadelphia–  an   Enormous Annual Ballance Indeed for this one article of our   Consumption – again – This Highly Interesting Section of the   State of New York – [is] Hourly increasing in Wealth &   Importance – in wants of Foreign articles & Resources of   Domestic Wealth – And let me ask where can the merchants of   Philadelphia Find a Body of such customers as exist Here –   where Such a certain& constant Trade–  Where such an increase of Trade where   such certain remittances–  Presenting also at Least one   Million of Dollars per annum Being Drawn out of the City at   this Time & How much Hereafter it is not possible to   predict–  This However may Be reasonably [assumed] as a fact   – that if such now is the amount of this Trade with all the   difficulties which want of Roads present – a good Road will   very materially increase it – in [----] to Enumerate the   advantages to be reaped by Establishing a Free communication   with this Most Fertile Section of New York would more   properly form a Volume than suit the limits of a Letter– Yet   I may add that This Cattle Trade – though in itself of no   mean Importance to Philadelphia is only One amongst many   Valuable Blessings which New York has taken from   Philadelphia By the Superior Foresight of Her Citizens –   There it Has been Esteemed Honorable & not unworthy the   attention of Her first merchants to Examine in to The   Internal Resources of Her State as well as of Her Sister   States – whilst the [reins] of Philadelphians Seems to Have   Been almost altogether Turned Towards the Sea – to Maritime   ports & Latterly to the Great Western Waters–  Yet what   assisted to raise Philadelphia to Her present prosperity &   Rank more than all other Things was the Internal resources   of Her own State & those Sections of other States within   marketable Reach – and it is only as these Blessings   multiply & Have facilities given them to Extend to & Support   Her that She can on any Just grounds expect to advance – If   this possition is True & if I Have notfailed in making good my ground of the Vast advantage of communication with a Section of the State of New York to Philadelphia is not our Road in Truth a Philadelphia Road & entitled to the Best wishes & aid of that City–   in the Magnitude of the Advantages to Be reaped from the State of New York through the Medium of this Road ??? I must not loose sight of the Trade of our own Counties which also at present for want of Roads lead[ing] to Philadelphia likewise goes to the City of New York ??? The amt of this I Have not the present means of ascertain[ing] But it must be considerable & is rapidly increasing??? The Coskectune and Great Bend Turnpike & the Milford & Owego Turnpike are striking at the Best Interests of Philadelphia??? New York City is By these Roads Establishing to Herself a Course of Trade which Though Now Easily Diverted from Her to Philadelphia is growing every day more & more difficult ??? a Timely Exertion an application of one mite of the Vast money Resources of Philada at this time in aid of this apparently insignificant Road will do more than the Expenditure of much Greater sums on Seemingly much Greater undertakings   Our Road will cut the Milford & Owego Road & the Coskectune & Great Bend Turnpike in so delicate a part that the whole Eastern Section of Each will be benumned & rendered lifeless ??? Their object (the secur[ing] the Trade to the City of New York)will be effectualy Counteracted & Defeated – & The Proverb   Be good to Philada – “One man Sows & another reaps the fruit   of His Labour”–
I have gone into a length of detail &   [-----] reasoning that I had not contemplated & I fear Have   tired Thee as well as myself.–  I crave forgiveness for my   fault–  I nevertheless would be much pleased if Thee Should   Think a Publication of Any of these Views – Couched in   different Language and Respectfuly dressed would in any way   be of advantage to us in gett[ing] through with our   important Road – for though I have made it appear that there   is abundant Riches to the West & North West of us & more   wealth than foresight in Philadelphia  Yet the fact must be   told that We are miserably poor – & that unless the City   aids our Road it may Be as long as Troys Seige before it is   Travelld–
Now if Thee would undertake the Herculean Task   of Picking the marrow (if there be any to be found) out of   this Long [map] of writing – Dress it & Suit it to the   palate of our Philadelphians & Serve it up to them in a News   paper I should Hope that it might in time of need possibly   aid us in Subscriptions to our Turnpike Stock –  This   However I leave to thy Better Judgement–
My Best Respects   to Aunt Grandmother & my cousins Generaly remain[ing] as   Ever affectionaly

Locust Shade. 3. 15. 1865

My dear Annie

Does   thee think I have quite forgotten thee and all thy kindness,   & my delightful visit to you? That I have been such a long   while without writing to thee. Indeed I have not, & never   shall I hope- but my wonderings [early] terminated last 7th   day & since then I have had a very bad cold, which thee   knows makes one lazy. - I have wanted to know how thee   faired after our parting on the hill. My walk was brisk & I   did not keep Maggie’s [---] waiting long, and did not feel   tired. I fear thee did not fare so well. Our visit to our   Wilmington friends was very pleasant.
Richie, thee knows, joined me in that. Tho he was not well   enough to enjoy it thoroughly. Lizzie seems very happy & we   hope is learning something, - at least she gets very good   numbers. - The roads were so bad it was not easy to get   about & my journey to Faulkland was a [arduous] one. but the   pleasure of cheering cousin Mary a little & hearing Dr   [Fell]  talk,- a great deal more than repaid me for it.-   

When I returned to Phila John & Sallie Hilles & I   went over to see Charles Rhoads. It was very touching to see   those five little motherless children. Charles looks tens   years older and much broken down.- His sister was very   pleasant- I never knew her before. They are certainly much   favored in having such kind caretakers & hardly feel their   loss as they will after awhile. - I often think of   what

thee said to me in the car after our visit to Clemmy. dear   Annie, with loving sympathy. Deserving too that I may fully   appreciate the blessing of a mothers love while mine is   still spared to me. - I hear Clemmy is going, or has gone to   Baltimore, to teach the Freedmen. What do you think of it?   It seems to me that anything that would give interesting   employment to both mind and body, would be good for her. Tho   I’m right sorry to have her go so far away. - Thee will miss   her too. - Do write some & tell me all about her plans. -   Lilly Collins seems to like her situation very well. I found   a letter from her awaiting me on my return.- She gives an   amusing account of a colored meeting which she attended, - a   real happy [----------] affair.- Lilly enjoys the variety I   should think & it keeps her from being homesick.- Cousin   Elizalooked & seemed more cheerful when I called - but she   certainly is very weak.-

I suppose the preparations   for the wedding are proceeding briskly- Does the go? I quite   want to hear about it. - Lizzie Brown’s sister is to be   married tomorrow & I hope the threatened storm will not come   to spoil all their nice dresses.- Lizzie’s friend Edward   Balderson stayed with us last night. He is to wait on a   young lady from Jersey -  so I fear the love affair between   him & Lizzie is all over - but time will make manifest. Has   thee seen anything more of the interesting students- Till   thy brother Thomas his opinion of the [-----] position of   Carpenters is very family impressed upon my mind.- It makes   me smile now to think how frightened I was, I deserved   rebuke too.- Do please write to me soon dear Annie.- My love   please to thy father & sister E & with a large share of the   same for thyself I am thy sincerely attached & grateful   friend

Clifton May 8th 1862

Dear Cousin., 
 
 It has occurred to me since writing my last letter that it might be best to inform thee how my father acquired the title to the lands Ive inherit from him. They were purchase by him, by Uncle John Tomas of the State of Penna. The Legislatures Land office being about that time / 1772 in Philadelphia. The Legislature at that early period - had made a rule that the public lands should be sold in tracts not exceeding 480 acres each- and that no individual should be permitted to purchase more- but finding this plan did not answer- they concluded to allow purchaser to buy more largely. On condition that they would find a number of nominal purchasers of 400 acre tracts- each receiving a deed poll for every tract- and then transferring them to the purchaser. Accordingly Father and Uncle John found a number of their friends & acquaintances to do this - and in this way bought of the state about 2500 acres of land under different Warranter homes. Uncle J Thomas becoming embarrassed and owing a debt to the firm of Adams and Loughey - his interest was free wh to sale- and bought by my father - who became sole owner of these lands. this transaction- is mentioned in the [land] deed now in my possession- which I am persuaded gives a clear title to the land. The deed polls for these traitswere in Brother Henry's possession but were consumed with other important papers by the bank fire. --- The record of these deed polls must have been in the Land office in Philadelphia - and taken to Harrisburg when the office & Legislature removed there. 

10th [may]
 Dear Cousin--- I rec'd thy letter of the 8th ins yesterday & I am very sorry thee has had so much trouble on my account. We had hoped our statements would have satisfied thee as to the clearness of the title to the lands. It is thought by some that if I had gone to the city - a personal interview with thee might have resulted differently- but I could not see that this was a right course-- I should be glad to sell our lands as thee suggests and it seems probable we may; but dear cousin, I fear we could not do in it time to save ourselves-- but I believe if I could sell my own land which is clear of all encumbrances - it might be a benefit to me as well as others- By offering to sell and pay part of the purchase money to be applied in reducing the mortgage on Henry's property- Wm L Gildersleac might be induced to free me from the lien he holds on my own. though a money makings he is said to be a religious man- and a friend to the poor- and if in addition to dealing his "bread to the hungry" he will also "let the oppressed go free" by releasing me "from this bond" he may be a gainer in the best sense without losing any of his earthly gains -- By selling some & gettingthe rest of my property clear it would reliever me from much embarrassment & trouble- there is not mortgage on them the taxes all paid by brother Richard with his [mon] - except for this year I believe and I can pay them with a small sum reserved in [Levanton] for such purchases- the lands are well timbered and in a good location, where they can easily be seen after. Those I propose to sell (as most advantageous to a purchaser are in a black - except one a valuable timbered lot No 81 - which is not far from the railroad it corners on No 82* containing 200 acres a lot for which I am offered $1218 = but I would rather be intently clear of any interference before I make a sale- The lands I want to sell are all mentioned and described in the large Deed I have in my possession which was drawn up by brother John who was considered a very good [--------] as well as a Lawyer. The lots are No 30.. Nos 42 52 53 54 & part of No 41 in all with lot No81 about 650 acres--- no 42 contains about 82 acres 26 of this lot being sold and a small clearing made- I suppose there is a drawing of there lots in the [m---] drawn by my nephew Charles which will show how they are situated. My cousins Cope Brothers in their last letter to me asked at what price it would be desirable to sell my property. Expecting to sell the whole property. I had to consult others about the price- but in regard to the lots I have mentioned I will say just what my friends may think it right to give- If I can by selling there lands pay W Gildersleac what he may require and leave enough to settle some debts and pay the arrears of taxes on some lands now in the hands of the [common coiners] in Wilkes Barres. I shall be glad to do so. the sale of our lumber will then I think carry as through

*this lot was under construct - previous to the lien on my other property. Which makes some doubt as to whether W L Gildersleac would claim it.and if in time- we can succeed in paying off the mortgage or sell our lands. I can then be repaid for the money. I may advance now to help others as well as myself. If times become more favorable - I have hopes with prudence & care- we may yet be extricated from our difficulties & be enabled to pay all our own liabilities. I am much in need of good council- I have suggested the sale of part of my lands as a means of relief but I am not certain even if I could effort it- that I could obtain a release from Wm. L Gildersleac-- 
 
 do as thee thinks but dear cousin- in regard to returning the papers- but if thee can help me in any way by advice it will be a great favor to thy
 affectionate cousin

Title: 1865 March 27 to My dearest children

Second day morn  3. 27.

My dearest children
I have   just come home from school & found yr. letter on the card   plate in the entry, wh. is where they always put them, so we   can be refreshed by the sight the moment we get in, & I was   refreshed I assure you.  Miss Field gets a great many & I   began to feel as if it was quite time for me to be having my   turn too.  You must remember that I never was befor so   entirely among strangers. & that your letters now will be my   best substitutes for home, as I shall depend on them greatly   I tried to write yesterday but did not make out much.  It   was my first 1st day in Baltimore.  Do you remember last 1st   day, when [were] were walking on the piazza & wondering   whether I shd. be here?  I did not much think I shd. then   but it seems I am.  Went to meeting yesterday morn. wh. I   quite enjoyed.  The only faces that I had ever seen before   were Deborah Thomas, Margy Coale & Tammie Miller.  I was   introduced to lots of others who were all very kind, & said   they were coming to see me.  There was a frd. named Elicott   & her two sisters who I think said they knew Mother.  We had   a sermon [fmr.] Deba  Thomas, the Dr, & one or two others.    After meeting in the aftnoon I set out to take a walk & was   joined by a young lady named Mary Elicott & & Jesse, who   took me a beautiful walk out to whats called theReservoir, where there is a fountain and a splendid view of   green hills & also of the distant waters of the bay, as well   as of parts of the city.  & yet it was not a walk of more   than a mile I shd. think
Baltimore is certainly a   beautiful place & I never realized before so fully what an   advantage what an advantage a hilly city possesses over a   flat one.  It quite throws Philada into the shade as far as   beauty is concerned.  There is such a refreshing variety in   the style of the houses, & other [buildings] & the hills   show them off to great advantage.  Charles St. seems to be   one of the most aristocratic in wh. the monument is   situated, a very beautiful column of white marble, 170 ft   high wh. as it stands upon a hill serves as a land mark for   a long distance round.  as you ascend the street with the   monument towering high above you the stars & stripes   floating over it & the city as you catch glimpses of it at   certain points apparently beneath you, the effect is very   imposing.  I think Phila. wld. strike one as flat after   this.  It has its advantages tho’.
Jesse has not come to   take us any rides yet.  tho he has promised to.  They say he   is very attentive to a certain – young lady here so we shall   not be so likely to derive as much benefit.  [---]. He has   been very polite so far.  & the ladies of the house are   continually laying plans for our entertainment wh. is   exceedingly kind in them.  I really feel more at home here   than I wd with some relations!Miss Talbot who is the housekeeper is one of the easy   talkative kind & makes me think a little of Mary Sayne.    Only far Superior.  they are exceedingly informal & get up &   wait on table & clear the things away in what thee, Nat,   wld. call a very shocking manner, but they are perfect   ladies for all – hospitable & fond of society, & they seem   to have a great many pleasant frds.  Their one girl is not   the most efficient cook in the world but I have such a good   appetite that I get along very well, – I feel most as hungry   as when I get home frm. school as I remember I used to when   I was a scholar.  We have breakfast about 7 1/2 go to sch.   about 8 1/4.  it is only 10 min. walk — get home about 1.   pretty tired with the 4 hrs. standing & ready to lie down   till dinner time at 2 1/2.  After dinner we get dressed & go   out or see company.  We most always have one or two callers.   at 7 again we have tea & then get our work and sit in the   parlor, & wonder who is coming when the bell rings.  Miss   Field I like exceedingly.  She is a Presbyterian & a very   superior girl I shd. think so that in the matter of   companionship I need to have had fewer fears and   trepidations than I had
The school duties are not long   but pretty arduous while they last.  We have to stand nearly   all the time.  At least the model teachers do, but we   inferiors take the liberty of popping downoccasionally, but it is at the risk of [good] order for   there are so many in the room that unless you stand up to   it, & keep your eye on all 30 or 40 at once they are very   apt to get wrong in the back seats.  One of the first points   is to get [them] disciplined.  Mr Waterman the principal –   drills his class just as you wld. soldiers makes them fold   their arms put out one foot & finally stand up just as a   general wld. his troops, & when school is dismissed they   file out in quite an imposing manner.  That is to teach them   obedience I suppose, wh. is a great point gained.  They also   teach them a kind of gymnastic exercises by way of   recreation. as they have no place to play & consequently no   regular recess or almost none.  Mine is the next to the   smallest class. & only studys reading & spelling in words of   4 or 5 letters wh. is not very interesting.  I have’nt   discovered that there are any specially smart or Topsy like   ones among them.  We dont stop to talk or get acquainted   much but just keep them doing something or other the whole   time.  Upon the whole I enjoy the effect of the work very   much. & outside of that it is all very pleasant.
Jesse   has just called in a splendid barouche to ask for Miss F or   I to ride.  As I had’nt finished my letter & she had’nt been   out for sev. days I persuaded her to go.  Yesterday was the   first pleasant one we have had. since I have been here.  I   was so sorry I took my purple dress out.  It is just what I   want this cool weather for afternoons.  I want twice as many   clothes here as at home.  Caroline dont thee want to be   benevolent and cut me out a pair of those round cuffs like   thee made me for undersleeves.  Thee can work the button   holes, & have them starched & ironed.  I have a pair of   sleevesthat I can sew them on.  I wish if you shd. have any   opportunity you wld. send me my old blk silk body wh. hangs   in the back room closet.  Tammy Miller is going to P   tomorrow & out to Mary Morris’ so I told her to tell you   that she saw the school “mam”  Give my love to Cousin Frank   & Mary  Tell Cousin Mary I had the pleasure of seeing her   mother & I think her father yesterday.  Give my love to   Cous. Sarah & to Tom & Harry & to all Aunt Carolines & any   other enquiring frds.
I have written you a lengthy   epistle I hope there’ll be an exception in favor of mistakes   & bad writing as I have written lying on my back  I was so   very tired this morning that I was too lazy to sit up.

My Dear Annie

I have   been very sorry to see day after day passing away without   any acknowledgment sent of thy very interesting &  welcome   lettter, which was a real treat to me. I wish there was some   hope of thy getting as good a one in reply but what with   colds & headache the little wit I ever had seems to have   departed, for which loss I console with my corespondents   every time one of my stupid effusions goes to the Post   Office.- I think a visit from thee & Clemmy would have an   enlivening effect & when summer comes so must you.- It was   very kind to send me that excellent Photo of Uncle Daniel,   after my negligence in the
matter of which I have been duly ashamed- and I am very much   obliged for it.- We had a nice visit to him had we not? If I   had not gone then, I fear I should not have seen him at all-   except that we did meet in the cars the other day- as being   sick in Wilmington entirely spoiled my Germantown visit. so   that I could make none of the calls I hoped to.-
How thee   must have enjoyed having Clemmy so long with thee. You had   splendid times I know. Indeed no one can be at your house   without enjoying themselves- At least that is my   experience.-
Thee knows perhaps that I have been a good   deal with my friend Lizzie Howell this winter.- Her mothers   death was so very sudden- only sickda little more that half   & hour- that the shock was fearful & Lizzie

was a long time recovering from it.- She is yet very sad-   and her brother being in poor health adds to the feeling.-   She was so sick for some weeks as rarely to get down stairs.   nervous & weak- but is now stronger & brighter & very busy   she writes me.- It is often a great blessing I think to   those in sorrow to have duties pressing upon them with must   be attended to & so the mind is diverted from its greif and   made to realize that life has yet much in store for them.   –
Did thee know our Georgie has been sent adrift from his   home into the city? We do miss him sadly- but he likes his   situation in a wholesale store in Market St, very well &    perhaps it is the right thing for him.- We hope that he may   be preserved from the temptations that summoned him.- Lizzie   has come home
for yearly meeting week.- We have been looking for aunt   Rachel Howland & her family every day but hear now they are   not coming till next week.-
Has thee been after “Trailing   Arbutus” this spring? [-] and I went the other day &  found   some pale blossoms. but very sweet.- Isnt it delightful to   hunt under the dead leaves for the delicate things- it seems   to make one feel young again fot the time.- Thee asks have I   read “Snow Bound”—Only a little of it &  have not happened   even to see it in a volume. But intend to get it soon if I   can.- The part I read was pleasant, simple &  [s-----] , -   as thee says more understandable than much of the latter day   poetry.- We have been reading “Across the Continent” and I   have indulged dreams of someday seeing the “Yosemite Valley”   if my finances get into sufficiently prosperous conditions   for such a journey.- Don’t thee 
want to go to Europe with the party that starts next month?-   It must be bery pleasant to look forward to & finer still to   experience if all things are fair & no anxieties to follow   you.- Wonder if John Wood &  Lily will go.- John says he   wants to & I guess Lily would not object.- I liked John   better than I expected to- but he is certainly neither   handsome nor dignified- but [-------] & kind hearted. I   should think.- Is’nt it a comfort Mary Ann Morris is so much   better? I cannot help hoping she will be entirely herself   again before very long.- Their house is very bright &   pleasant & I should think they might be very happy there-   This to be sure happiness is not a thing of outward   circumstances [----]Did thee remember that yesterday was the anniversary of our   dear Presidents death? Wonder where another year will find   us.- What do thy brothers think of our prospects with such a   man as Johnson at the helm.- It is a comfort that the crew   of out ship of State are so staunch & true.-
Suppose   Marry Emma Stokes passed meeting last third day- I do like   Alexander Wood very much. He seems so open & honest.- Will   they have a wedding  I wonder- or just be married & go   travelling.- I hear friends at Arch Street did not accept   Sue Farnum’s resignation. Had she violated discipline before   presenting it? The usual yearly mtg storms seems to be   brewing this evening- but I hope it wont come this.- Does   thee go in and out every day?.- Please excuse this [prosy]   sheet dear Annie & write very soon.- My love please to thy   sister E. – Very loving by thine

   Dear Henry
   
   From thy letter of yesterday I perceive that doubts still exist as to the apprehended piracy- & the papers which reach us are full of contradictions & vain conjectures- at one time we were assured that the informtation had reached Norfolk about the same time it reached N Castle- & after that statement had passed current for some days we find by a Balte. paper that the first knowledge they had of it in Norfolk was the 25th in the afternoon.  The pilots if I recollect first reported the capturing schooner to be full of men & black sided- it now seems they kept so far away that they could not see whether the ship was bright sided- still they alledge to have distinctly seen the cross in her foretop sail- This circumstance is the most striking, & yet it is possible that at their distance they might be mistaken even in that.  I observe a story has been circulate in NYork of an oyster boat having supplied the ship at Sea- & that is believed, contradicted & reiterated- If that were true it wd. indeed be some comfort, as it might accot. for the whole affair, making some allowances for discrepancies.  It is altogether a painful subject, & has caused me much perhaps useless anxiety.  but no benefit can arise from despondency.  & it is our duty to submit to the Divine Will- & our best interest too- Let us then hope while hope we may-29th
   
   The letter from Capn. Miller which I read in the papers that reached us last evening, stating that information had been recd. from the Break Water by a Schr. just arrived, that she has passed the Susqa. of Chincoteague, a shr. along side of her- if true, wd. seem to put an end to doubt- But why did not Miller mention the name of the Schr. at the Break Water.  & how did that Schr. know what he saw was the Susqa.  If the ship was in the situation mentioned, & at the time mentioned, it argues a most extraordinary degree of hardy hood in the Pirate.
   
   Yesterday commenced the battle on the Judiciary.  Judge Hopkinson opened the debate- in a masterly manner- he spoke for 3 hours, & then gave way to a motion for adjournment- of course he will proceed with his argument 2d. day morning.  I hear it will prove unavailing- so many of the Convention being resolved on a change.  The discussion will no doubt be protracted thoughout all this week, perhaps even another- so many will try to distinguish themselves on this fruitful subject.  Feeling so much disappointed by the issue of the militia question I can no longer hope for much good from this Convention.  Indeed I care very little now how bad they may make a constitution- the worse perhaps the better-as the people will be the more likely to, reject it.  Earl made his appearance yesterday and forthwith commenced taking notes of Hopkinsons speech- He will attempt a reply- so will I suspect Ingersoll- but the most powerful antagonist will be Woodward- from Luzerne.  He is plausible, argumentative & fluent, but with all a thorough radical & in my judgement a most mischevous politician.  Doran & others are still absent- When I shall be relieved from my unpleasant imprisonment I cannot say.

   Please say to Wm Evans that I have just recd. his Note with the Pamphlets, of wh. I shall endeavor to make a proper use- but as that subject has been dismissed for the present, & the mind of the members are filled with the Judiciary question I fear were I now to distribute them- they wd. just be glanced at- thrown aside & forgotten- The subject will come up again on 2d. reading & then may be a suitable time for their distribution.  My own fears are however that Friends have little more to hope for from this Convention.Thos. P. Cope

   Dear Alfred
    
   I wrote to Henry yesterday & in the evening recd. thine of the 28th-
   
   The still absorbing topic is the ship & those on board- it is difficult to discharge the subject from the mind however useless it may be to indulge in speculation & conjecture.  Time will bring all things to light, & we must patiently wait the event trusting in Providence that whatever that result may be, whether according to our conceptions for good or for ill, it will nevertheless be right.
   
   Henry mentioned in one of his Letters the subject of the railing that Caleb wd. write to me abt. it- In my reply I sd. I wd. give it my attention when I heard from C.
   
   As to Barton I wish H.y to give him a ck for the $50 he needs- Thou hast not yet said whether mother recd. one, or two, Letters from me- I shd. like to know- I am glad to learn that EW intends coming to the City- The air of the country [?] I think be too sharp for her during winter, & in the City she will be nearer to medical aid-
   
   The discussion on the Judiciary is proceeding- Judge H. has just closed a very lucid & argumentative & powerful address- Woodward has risen in reply- He will be wiley, but he will not respite his antagonist.  The issue isuncertain.  So much will be sacrificed to ambition, party views & popular prejudice.  Should the radicals succees in prostrating the Judiciary by rendering them subservient to the Legislature, farewell to liberty & security.  Indeed under the garb of democracy & feeling for the people this republic seems fast travelling towards a despotism & it is of little importance to our security whether it be the despotism of the rabble or the despotism of a single tyrant.  The latter would probably be the least exceptionable- but if the first happen, the latter will not be slow to follow- Ingersoll will soon follow Woodward.  I wish our friends, that is the Conservatives, wd. permit the disorganizers to vent themselves fully- before they reply.  This will probably not happen, & I cannot say when the debate will terminate- certainly not this week- at least I fear not.
   
   I have just been informed that Caleb passed through Harrisburg yesterday.  I recd a bundle of pamphlets, wh no doubt came by him.  I suppose he could not delay long enough to call on me.
   
   I have become accustomed to listen & to write at the sametime- still I may & do often commit errors of commission & omission which wd. have been avoided under a more abstracted condition- but if at anytime I omitnoting matters to wh my attention should be given, I hope to be reminded of my deficiency.
   
   I wished mother to inform me whether the Garden plot was completed- Whether the Carpenters had finished their work, Whether C H Canby was done.  This I think was in my last letter to her.  I want her to me reminded of my wish to hear from her.
   
   The mail hour is at hand & I must close.

   Dear Alfred
   
   Yesterday after I had sealed my Letter to thy dear mother the mail brt. me thine of the 7th-
   
   The time of our adjournment is as uncertain as ever- To day I expect we shall close the debate on the last sec of the 1st article.  The veto power caused some discussion- but the majority for returning the provisions of the Constitution on that subject, has been expectedly great- The next great effort of the reformers will be on the Judiciary- but I shall not be at all surprised if they succeed little better in that than in other things- Indeed I cannot help hoping that our Constitution will not undergo any very great change- We have however the most exciting subjects yet to come up- & no man can predict the time they may occupy.
   
   Having heard since coming here the speech made by Judge Hallowell much landed, I felt anxious to see it- but if it cannot be had we myst try to do without it- We have today some skirmishing on a resolution to prohibit colored persons from coming into the State- a motion was made to postpone it indefinitely, but I regret to say it did not prevail-  It was however postponed for the present-
   
   I shall indeed rejoice when I can be permitted to join you once more in Race Street- but am truly rejoiced to hear of all being well-
   
   I had a fall to day from wh. I recd. some slight injury & my principal object in writing now has been to mention it lest some other person shd. do so to make you uneasy- I hurt my side & head a little- perhaps it w.d be as well to say little about it- lest mother sh.d be uneasy I made a mistep on the stair way

   Dear Alfred,
   
   It is growing towards being after sunset, but while Job is making arrangements for our departure tomorrow morning in the Massacheusetts Steamer for Providence, it falls to my lot to drop a line by Wm who is intended send with the Carriage & Horses next day, by return of the same Steamer to NYk thence to proceed on his way to Philada.-  You will all be gratified to hear of thy dear mothers improved health, & also of Eleanors- altho we have experienced hot weather for some days, & have qualms as to the propriety of throwing ourselves into a more heated atmosphere-  Stephen P. Morris arrived here yesterday from Providence, & reports the thermometer to have been up to 95 the day before.  The air since dinner to day has become cooler, & we may reasonably hope will improve a pace shortlty-  Other things change as well as the weather- & now after writing so far, a bell man announces that a Balloon Steamer is to be here tomorrow from P. & return again at 3 AM-  We wished originally to go by her- but she has undergone repairs, & there was this morning no certainty when she wd. be here-  We therefore had made up our minds to go by the Massachusetts between 6 & 7 AM-  We intend to visit N. Bedford, Boston, Wooster &c &c.  & stop at Hartford Ct where letters may meet us on our way home, not later than 10 days from today-
   
   We have visited most of the Lions- & among them the Library, where rest the remains of divers elderly volumes-  The discoveries of the Icelanders are there deposited-  We met in the St a certain antiquarian, named Bull, with whom we held learned converse on those discoveries-  On asking him if he had heard of the learned northener who had found a stone with Runic Characters- a temple, & an image representing the Scandanavian God Thor, in Brazil- He said he had not- & then added, "so long as they confined themselves to N. Am, I was willing to concede that point to them- but now that they are going to claim S. Am too, I wont believe any of it"-  The old man may have read our couplet- "They lose the whole who claim too much
    
   As Simon Snyder said in Dutch- And the Danes may now hang up their fiddle, & content themselves with their own Icy shores-The drives abt. Newport are fine- but we have too much dust- the grass is nevertheless very fresh- & the fields are beautiful- We visited a tract at Brenins Point, I side of the Island, & skirted by the Ocean- & a more fertile splendid farm, I do not remember ever to have seen-  They use the seaweed abundantly, as a manure- & also a fish called Manhayden- dragged from the Ocean by nets, & sold at 14 Cts a Bbl- They are very oily- but I do not admire the filthy practice of strewing them over the fields to contaminiate the air-  The bathing here is very good & Job & I use it freely- while mother & E continue their purifications in the warm salt bath-  Among our numerous lodgers we have had Abraham Knickerboker & wife- He the lineal descendant of the true Dietrich- & has his residence at the very spot described by Irving, whose description he says is very correct-  He is an intelligent and well informed man, speaking the English fluently- & his wife interested us very much, by her smiley face, he goodly appearance & good sense-  The good man himself is out of health, & his loving spouse seems very uneasy abt. him-  On leaving us they each gave us a cordial invitation to visit them at their home in the romantic poetical village of Schaghticoke-
     
   While writing Elenor bids me say- you have among you, used her [---] badly, in not even noticing a Letter- wh he took trouble- pains taking man- to endite to some of you- but as she has stepped out- I do not know when manufactured, nor to whom directed- Cara’s epistle of odds & ends- like this of mine- has been received, & was, for her comfort, very satisfactory-
   
   Having in council duly convened decided to go by the Baloon to morrow.

   Dear Alfred,
   
   It is growing towards being after sunset, but while Job is making arrangements for our departure tomorrow morning in the Massacheusetts Steamer for Providence, it falls to my lot to drop a line by Wm who is intended send with the Carriage & Horses next day, by return of the same Steamer to NYk thence to proceed on his way to Philada.-  You will all be gratified to hear of thy dear mothers improved health, & also of Eleanors- altho we have experienced hot weather for some days, & have qualms as to the propriety of throwing ourselves into a more heated atmosphere-  Stephen P. Morris arrived here yesterday from Providence, & reports the thermometer to have been up to 95 the day before.  The air since dinner to day has become cooler, & we may reasonably hope will improve a pace shortlty-  Other things change as well as the weather- & now after writing so far, a bell man announces that a Balloon Steamer is to be here tomorrow from P. & return again at 3 AM-  We wished originally to go by her- but she has undergone repairs, & there was this morning no certainty when she wd. be here-  We therefore had made up our minds to go by the Massachusetts between 6 & 7 AM-  We intend to visit N. Bedford, Boston, Wooster &c &c.  & stop at Hartford Ct where letters may meet us on our way home, not later than 10 days from today-
   
   We have visited most of the Lions- & among them the Library, where rest the remains of divers elderly volumes-  The discoveries of the Icelanders are there deposited-  We met in the St a certain antiquarian, named Bull, with whom we held learned converse on those discoveries-  On asking him if he had heard of the learned northener who had found a stone with Runic Characters- a temple, & an image representing the Scandanavian God Thor, in Brazil- He said he had not- & then added, "so long as they confined themselves to N. Am, I was willing to concede that point to them- but now that they are going to claim S. Am too, I wont believe any of it"-  The old man may have read our couplet- "They lose the whole who claim too much
    
   As Simon Snyder said in Dutch- And the Danes may now hang up their fiddle, & content themselves with their own Icy shores-The drives abt. Newport are fine- but we have too much dust- the grass is nevertheless very fresh- & the fields are beautiful- We visited a tract at Brenins Point, I side of the Island, & skirted by the Ocean- & a more fertile splendid farm, I do not remember ever to have seen-  They use the seaweed abundantly, as a manure- & also a fish called Manhayden- dragged from the Ocean by nets, & sold at 14 Cts a Bbl- They are very oily- but I do not admire the filthy practice of strewing them over the fields to contaminiate the air-  The bathing here is very good & Job & I use it freely- while mother & E continue their purifications in the warm salt bath-  Among our numerous lodgers we have had Abraham Knickerboker & wife- He the lineal descendant of the true Dietrich- & has his residence at the very spot described by Irving, whose description he says is very correct-  He is an intelligent and well informed man, speaking the English fluently- & his wife interested us very much, by her smiley face, he goodly appearance & good sense-  The good man himself is out of health, & his loving spouse seems very uneasy abt. him-  On leaving us they each gave us a cordial invitation to visit them at their home in the romantic poetical village of Schaghticoke-
     
   While writing Elenor bids me say- you have among you, used her [---] badly, in not even noticing a Letter- wh he took trouble- pains taking man- to endite to some of you- but as she has stepped out- I do not know when manufactured, nor to whom directed- Cara’s epistle of odds & ends- like this of mine- has been received, & was, for her comfort, very satisfactory-
   
   Having in council duly convened decided to go by the Baloon to morrow.  I have come to the conclusion to rest for the present from my labours- to resume if needs be, in the morning but not until I say that we this afternoon paid another visit to the afflicted family mentioned before- none of them are better- the mother indeed much worse- she seems destined we think to take her departure to a better world very soon-

   Dear Uncle,
   
   As I suppose that thee has by this time returned from Sykens' Valley, I will endeavour this morning, to fulfil my promise.  I wish that I could find something to say that would interest thee but I am afraid that in a place like this a person is much better able to hear than to relate news.  Had thee a pleasant time at Sykens' Valley?  It is now rather later in the season than it was when we visited it several years ago.  I recollect that the country was very pleasant then, and I suppose that it is still more so now unless the lateness of the season has retarded the growth of the plants in such a degree as that they should not be any more in bloom than they were then.  I expect that in thy promised letter thee will give a very interesting account of the journey.  I must not forget to mention that we expect to have a French teacher here next week.  He is a Frenchman and has lately come from Ireland where he had been living since his banishment and where his wife now is.  He was a captain under Buonaparte and showed us a number of wounds which he received in the battle ofLeipsic with lances, and several places where bullets had gone entirely through his arms.  When the Pope was taken prisoner by Buonaparte he was guard over him and he treated the Pope so kindly that when he was liberated he made him captain of the Guards of Honor.  He appears to be a very pleasing and goodn-natured man and like all the French, extremely polite.  We expect that he will tell us many very interesting accounts of the battles that he has been present at.  He appears to be a very intelligent man and speaks Arabic, Spanish, Italian and English very fluently.  He accompanied his father who was minister to the Count of Persia and while there acquired a knowledge of the Arabic language.  His name his D'Mouillon.  I do not know whether I have spelt it right or not, but that is the way that it is pronounced.

   Dear Clemmie,
   Grandfather desired me to acknowledge the receipt of thy acceptable letter of last seventh day. I am sorry for thy sake that it has not fallen into better hand, but if thee will believe that I have the will to send thee such a letter as would give thee a great deal of pleasure, I will rely upon the interest it will have for thee as coming from among and giving thee a great deal of pleasure. I will rely upon the interest it will have for thee as coming from among and giving thee perhaps, the latest news of some of those who think so much of thee. Anne and I entirely agree with thee in considering that the pleasantest part of the days journey was when we were all traveling together. We ran off the track about half an hour after we parted and were four hours in a pretty hot place before we were on our way again. If we had foreseen that we were to pass nearly the whole day on the road might have he fellow travelers a greater distance and lightened me and others burdens. Thee must have had a very tiresome journey all the way home Henry Drinker tells us thee had to ride from Wilkes-Barre in the hot sun in an open wagon: he thinks they did much better. When thee comes down next winder, take thou Scranton unto. We are glad to hear that thee friend Uncle William so much better and the rest all well. Grandfather seems stronger and generally better than when he fist came out in the country- He sends his love to thee and all the family. Aunt Caroline, Frank and Ellie are at Cape May. I forget whetherthey went before thee left: they wrote several days ago that Ellie’s general health was improved We have heard indirectly that Mary was unwell- Julia has gone to Reading for a few weeks. Aunt Mary returned to Jersey yesterday I believe- She was kept in turn an account of Elizabeth’s mother having an attack very much like if not really cholera. She was very ill one night: they have gone to Cape May since with Henry and Ellie. The three families that live in that unnamed corner of this country that is so hard to find am pretty much as the left them they all send their love. Elizabeth says she would be very glad if thee would write to her if thee fells so inclined. Please tell Uncle William that a package for Grandfather by Henry Drinker came safe to hand the morning- Uncle Alfred has taken the letter out to him. He comes in and spends every "third-day" in town.   
   I hope we shall hear from thee often; if thee should write to me it would give me much pleasure.
   
   Affectionately thy cousin,
   Thomas P Cope Jr.

   Dear Clemmie,
   
   Not having a woman's privilege as to postscripts I begin afresh.  I have no objections however to having reason to call the by name again – it seems more natural and sociable and I see thee look up from thy work or from study or quiet wordto hear what I have to say- I finished in a hurry yesterday afternoon intending to mail this before leaving town, but time failing I have an opportunity to say that Anne secured a letter from Eddy last evening in which he says nothing about his bodily conditions, but that his discontent which she had inquired about are improving" Your visit no doubt did him good. Visits from home to a boy at school are a pleasant recollections for the rest of his life.
   
   Thee did not grieve much about they blanket shawl when thee was riding in the stage at night; it will be cooler when thee comes down next fall and we will take care to sent it up to thee in time. Grandfather will be glad to hear from thee and I hope if thee is not afraid of a repetition of what thy first letter has brought upon thee, that thee will write to [.]
   
   With many desire for thy happiness.
 Affectionately, thy Cousin,

   Thy letter of 28 ult. has been rec'd.  Wm Drinker has transferred his claim on Father to Martin Curtis, store-keeper of Montrose.  ye latter mentioned to me, when I was last in Montrose, that Wm has spoken to him on the subject of stopping any legal proceedings that may have been commenced.  this he said he was willing to do, tho' he wd. not relinquish a cent of ye claim, wh he was sure must be all paid: that unless a legal tender had been made, interest cd. be obtained on ye respective sums for ye time of their becoming due: that he knew W. Drinker had pd. a considerable portion of them in cash, because they had been pd.thro' him.  I told him that I tho't he had only heard one side of the case & advised him not to be to confident of success.-  W.D. also says that he subjected himself to considerable inconvenience in order to pay the taxes, but considered that ye debt was in safe hands & wd. ne accumulating by ye addition of interest.

   I reached this place after a pleasant journey, which occupied, as usual, 2 days.  I had pleasant company, & never before endured so little fatigue in crossing the Pokono.  the road over it is considerably improved.  I had the company of Jos'h [S?]inton  from Nazareth to Wilkes-barre.  he was on his return from attending the Orthodox Yearly Meeting.-  I was much pleased with the verdant appearance of the fields in this part of ye country.  ye season is much less advanced than usual at this time of year, but the grass looks well.-  there has not been so much done at my buildings during my absense as I expected wd. have been done, but ye workmen are now busily employed.  my Scotch farmer, I think it likely, will maintain the character of his countrymen for industry & fidelity, but I have not hired him long enough, fairly to test his qualifications.  ye female part of his family, however, it too numerous to suit me, as I have but little employment for women.-  tho' I have but little to communicate, I tho't I wd. not let a private opp'y pass without informing you of my safe arrival here & present health.  I shall feel anxious to hear from the invalids of thy family, tho' I hope they are not now invalids.-  I hope also that our new Mother may, by this time have regained her usual health.-  please give my love to all my kind friends & relatives, with whom I have so recently passed so many pleasant hours, that ye chain of communication between us, though separated, seems unbroken & strong.-  if thee shd. see Uncle Jasper please tell him, that I delivered his letter to Henry Colt, but that John N Conyngham had left Montrose before I arrived.  I therefore immediately forwarded the letter for him, to Wilkesbarre, & have little doubt but that he received it before leaving there for Bradford County.   I remain thy affectionate brother,
   Wm D CopePlease say to Eleanor, that I hope she will not mention to Cousins Abby Ann & Emma, any remarks that I made with regard to the evening company invited by them a short time before I left the City & of which I was one.  such observations are sometimes repeated under circumstances that give them an air of more seriousness than was intended by the one who makes them.[Note in second hand: W.D.

   Having an opp'y of writing, I will embrace it if it be only to thank thee for thy kind attention to the subjects mentioned in thine of 22 ult.-  ye mildness of ye season so far, will probably favor the operations of the Ches. & Del. Canal Co.-  I hope the Algonquin may do well at Savannah, as I observe by late a/cts, that no vessels were up there, & freights were brisk, tho' ye rates were low.  if it be not improper, nor too much trouble, please mention in writing to me, ye names of ye authors of any of the essays in "the Friend," that may come to thy knowledge.-  we have lately had a visit in these parts, from two hetorodox friends, Jno. Foulke of Quakertown, Bucks Co., & Salathiel Cleaver, of Montgomery Co.-  they had meetings at Friendsville, & in the neighborhood.  the Presbyterians expressedtheir satisfaction with the communications of J. Foulke.  I did not hear him speak in public, but understand that he did not speak on doctrinal points.  he is a man of venerable appearance, & his plain, communicative, unostentatious habits & manners, are calculated to preposess a stranger in his favour.  amongst other places, that he has visited, is ye settlement of the German Separatists in the Western country.  he speaks of their condition as very comfortable & flourishing.  the canal which is to connect the Lakes with the Ohio, passes thro' their land.
   
   I have just rec'd a letter from Caroline.  please give my love to her & tell her, that I will thank her to use my authority in contradicting any rumours of the kind to which she alludes.-  we are obliged to submit to the mortification of being ye subjects of them, but I think it is no more improper to contradict such, than any other incorrect reports.
   
   I have a paymt. to make before long, & expect to draw on the firm in a few days, to meet it, for about $200.-
   
   With love to all, I remain thy affectionate brother,

Woodbourne, 5 month 15th 1830
   Dear Brother:
   
   Thy acceptable letter of 7th inst.  has been rec'd.  thy observations with regard to retirement & the Christian's duty, are certainly correct in the abstract, but I think it will be readily admitted by thee on reflection, that remotely placed as thou art from ye scene in which I move, a correct opinion of ye course most proper for me to pursue, cannot easily be formulated, either by thyself, or any one similarly situated.  to be candid; I may mention, that I think myself pretty fortunate in being able by some excersize or display of management, to make a live,- to use a significant term of the Yankees here,- to possess or enjoy ye common comforts of life.  I have therefore, not much time or inducement to propound to myself sentimental or metaphysical queries in regard to duties, problematical, or supposed to be omitted.  I may be compared in some measure to an honest & benevolent day labourer. (not insinuating that I have a claim to ye character of benevolence.)-  if a distressed fellow creature cross his path or approach his cabin, no one is more willing to dispense ye comforts with which he may be blessed.  but he cannot, like his more wealthy & independent fellow-citizens, go in quest of objects of charity.-  ye call of benevolence, shd. be heard & obeyed, and I freely acknowledge that it ought to be our aim, so to arrange our temporal concerns, as to be in the way of receiving benefit & advantage from our fellow men, or of administering ye same to them, as opportunities present.  this view & reflection, I wish to bring home to myself.  but I have undertaken a business & entered upon a course of life which I had but little previous knowledge, for which I had but little previous education & of which I had formed erroneous expectations.  it wd. certainly have been better on some accounts, if I had taken up my abode in a town or village, upon my first making this county my residence.  if I had excluded farming & building from my views, my business wd. have been much simplified.  but I wished to select ye most adventageous situation for promoting the interest & settlement of Father's est'e: and I think by showing that I consider ye land and ye country good enough for myself, a favorable effect has been & will continueto be produced.  ye difficulty of obtaining assistance here, is a great drawback to ye comfort & satisfaction of ye farmer.  yet as I have put ye machine in motion, I must keep it moving, & as I am harnessed in, I must move with it, unless I have some one to supply my place.  I still indulge ye hope that I shall be able to pull things into proper train, but I begin to think that it will require about as many years to accomplish ye object, as I supposed it would of weeks, before commencing ye undertaking.  I am often however enabled, gratefully to call to mind ye advantage of my present situation, to that of remaining in the City, a victim to disease.  tho' I am thankful that my circumstances are what they are, I trust I shall have sense enough to keep in view that I am not a man of fortune, in ye sense that ye term is generally understood; and when I see how easily my income & more than my income, is fittered away, and how little is to be seen of its effects, I am induced to pause, before launching out into expensesm without calculation.  when & how, ye returns are to come, is uncertain.  a farm in a new county is indeed a quicksand, so great are its absorbing qualities; & we have to deal here with a shewd set of sharpers.  a man who is considered to be in tolerably good circumstances, & is supposed to have money, must expect to be asked two prices for everything, & they will be Jewed or Yankeed out of him, if he does not look about him with eagle eyes.-  Dr. Rose, to be sure, in ye course of upwards of twenty years has done much: but ye course pursued by one man, does not form a rule for another, differently circumstanced.  he has had a numerous class of settlers, of diversified trades & occupations to assist him, to whom he has sold land for good prices, & from many of whom he wd. probably have obtained nothing, had he not have taken pay in such kind of assistance.-  Caleb Carmalt is similarly situated.-  speaking of Caleb, reminds me of a circumstance which occurred at the last Friendsville Preparative Meeting.  he was present, and John Kite, the clerk, objected to proceeding with ye business, whilst one who was not a member of the Society, was in ye house.  Caleb said that he supposed he was ye person alluded to, but that he had proof of his being a member of the Society of Friends, which he cd. produce if necessary.  one of the Hicksites remarked, that ye meeting itself had no information, or at least no official information of C. Carmalt's disownment.  a number of remarks were made in bothsides, but there seemed to be a general sentimentin favour of proceeding with what was before the meeting, without further discussion or excitement, and the clerk accordingly complied with what seemed to be the wish of the meeting.-  this is about ye substance of an account given by a Hicksite to E. Walker.-  what I mentioned in ye preceding part of my letter with regard to charity & benevolence, also recalls to recollection ye case of Uniah Estes, one of Father's settlers, who for ye last 6 weeks or 2 months, has been afflicted with mental alienation.  Jno. Mann kept him at his house several weeks.  by judicious management there, he has been so far resolved, that it was considered safe to suffer him to return to his family.  if he shd. have a relapse which is feared, it is tho't that it wd. be advisable to send him to Friends' Assylum.  if ye information is in thy possession or can be conveniently obtained by thee, I will thank thee to mention in thy next, ye lowest term on which poor patients are rec'd into that institution.  he is a member of the Society of Friends & belongs to a monthly meeting in ye State of New York.-  Elias Bennet, an old & respectable settler on ye Susqa. Co. Tract, who, Father will probably recollect was grievously afflicted with a cancer, died in ye early part of this Spring.  he has bequeathed his farm, or his right in it, to two of his sons.-  my annual subscription in advance, to "the Friend," became due in ye early part of this month.  I will be obliged by thy having it paid when convenient, & having a rec't taken.-  please not to forget my subscription to the Athenaeum.  I wish I were well rid of my share of stock.  I did not intend to have omitted to mention, that there was no charge in my a/c with the old firm of Thomas P Cope & Sons, for my proportion of ye amo't of subscription to the "Morning Journal."  it would I think be no more than right that I shd. pay part of it.-  I shall be anxious relative to Sister Caroline, & will be obliged by thy giving me information relative to her state of health, as soon as convenient.
   
   With love to all, I remain affectionately thy Brother,

   Dear Brother:
   
   The idea presented in thine of ye 20 inst. of finding me out in the woods, I may truly say, excited in me very pleasant feelings; tho' at ye same time, I feel as if I can scarcely dare to invite you, for reasons that I think it wd. not be proper to mention in a letter. I will give thee a remote exception of what amongst other things, I allude to, by refering to a frequent remark, that in every flock, there is a black sheep, & a Judas in every community. more than this, I ought not to say. I believe I have never hesitated to answer any query put to me by relatives & friends respecting my situation, nor have I any objections to doing so, unless I may have a very particular reason for secrecy. but Marmaduke will perhaps from having been an impartial spectator, be more likely to give thee a satisfactory description of Woodbourne than myself.- E. Walker bro't me thy letter whilst I was spending ye evening as usual, with his family. I mentioned what was said by thee about visiting me. George desired me to tell thee that they shd. be very glad to see thee: and Priscilla said, tell him to bring Rachel &Martha. they all seemed to be as glad to see Marmaduke & our other cousins, as if they had been their own relations. it seemed to me to be quite like an era in ye history of Woodbourne, when my City relations had actually paid me a visit.- I think you had better come on, and take us by surprise as they did, and thus give us no time to think about any obstructions, objections, or difficulties. with regard to any pecuniary considerations, I think I cd. fully satisfy my neighbours, tho' they will not listen to any direct proposition relative to consideration money.- in expressing what precedes, I have used ye freedom, which ought to exist in ye intercourse between brothers. to one, who does not stand in ye same relationship to me as thyself, I wd. have felt some hesitation in saying what I have said to thee.- I was much interested in reading thy description of ye proposed institution for imparting instruction in ye higher branches of learning to the children of Friends, and had no idea that so great an advance had been made towards affecting ye object in view. it is a noble undertaking, & if accomplished, will tend to increase ye reputation of the Society. the sup-position or opinion, that our profession, principles or religion acquires ye discouragement of literary knowledge & intelligence, appears to me pretty evidently to be a mistake.-  I was fearful that there wd. be an appearance of ambiguity in my observations with regard to the Union Canal stock.  In my last communication on ye subject, I expressed a willingness to invest, if I cd. obtain five per cent on the am't invested.  this I shd. receive, were I to give $240 per share, or 120 per cent.  consequently, if I am right in my estimate, ye price is still below my limits.  but of course, there would be no advantage in offering a high price, if there is none of the stock for sale.-  I am much obliged to thy attention to the subject.  supposing that the Bank of Penna has declared ye dame divd. for ye last as for ye previous half year, I inclose a Power of Att'y for its collection, & one also for the interest on the C & D Canal loan.  if the Lehigh Co. shd. have disclosed a divd. please inform me.  I see by the news-papers, that 3 1/2% has been declared by the U.S. B'k.

   My Dear Brother:
   
   I now write to thee, under the pressure of misfortune.-  my dwelling house, & nearly all its contents have been reduced to ashes.  the result of two years' toil, anxiety, & incessant thought & attention have gone, as it were in an instant, beyond recall.  I had advanced so far in my improvements, that I began to indulge the hope that their completion might be effected, & I enabled to enjoy some advantage from them, & some degree of repose from the troublesome kind of occupation which they gave me.-  the exterior was handsomely painted, the windows hung with green [verition] shutters & I had made an agreement with a person to plaister the rooms.-  this, my dear brother, is a misfortune that I find hard to bear.  it has come upon me so suddenly & unexpectedly!-  it seems doubly so, when I reflect upon ye time and thought that is has required to plan ye various conveniences that had been constructed, and the labour that had been spent in collecting & preparing what I had, in & about my house.  I had formed an attachment to almost everything that I had obtained ye possession of in this way, & enjoyed a degree of satisfaction in reflecting upon ye difficulties that I had overcome.  I feel at present, as if I had scarcely spirit & fortitude enough to continue a method of getting along with my concerns & business.  to be without a house on a farm, is truly embarrassing.  thou hast sympathized with me, my dear brother, in temporal afflictions, with which both of us have been equally affected & concerned, & I have no doubt but that thou wilt in this.  I feel a wish to fly to thee for consolation, as well as to avoid ye sight of ye ruins of my dwelling, which stare me constantly in ye face.  but I seem to be tied here, as there is no one to attend to my concerns in my absense, & I am also aware that no human power can heal the wounds inflicted by misfortune.-  I have rece'd, dear brother, another deeply instructive lesson on ye uncertainty & instability of earthly possessions.  to be sure, a calamity of ye kind that has befallen me, seems light, when we reflect upon ye comparatively short period of existence here, and of the primary & unspeakably greater importance of securing an interest & inheritance in the world to come.  but we are so constituted, that ye feelings of our nature, appear as if they wd. at times obtain ye mastery over us.  mine seem as if they would sometimes overcome me.-  I will be obliged by thy not showing this letter to others, as it contains some of ye outpourings of my feelings, whilst smarting under misfortune, and which I shall perhaps be ashamed of, after I shall have had time to stay my mind on ye foundationwhere alone, enduring & unfailing consolation is to be found.-  I had indulged in many pleasing anticipations of ye reward that wd. await me, upon the result of my labours.-  they are all blasted!  the ways of Providence are mysterious.  may I be resigned to its will.-  no insurance had been effected on my property.  the Philada. offices that I applied to, declined insuring, & there is a difficulty in effecting insurance at the N. York offices, owing to the law lately passed by the Legislature of Penna.  before ye passage of that law, one or more of the N. York offices had an agent at Montrose.  he cannot now act for them.-  I had intended, after ye completion of my buildings, to have made another effort to have insurance made.-  ye fire is supposed to have been communicated to some wood-work about & near to, the oven.  it burst out of ye roof & sides of ye house just as we were sitting down to dinner, about 1, O’clock on 6th day last, & so rapidly did ye flames spread, that I had only time to rescue my manuscript papers, part of my personal clothing, & a few articles of furniture, before ye heat & smoke had enveloped everything, so that no one could enter or approach near to the building.  I cd. not have thought before experiencing it, that a loss of this kind wd. have been so hard to bear.-  I am now left more dependant than I have ever before been since residing here, upon ye kindness of my neighbours.-  E. Walker's family have offered me shelter & lodging, and have done all in their power to make me comfortable.  I deire that I may be sufficiently grateful for their kind assistance & sympathy.   Please convey assurances of love & regard to relatives & friends, from thy affectionate brother,   Wm D Cope

   I now take up my pen to write to thee my much esteemed Friend William D Cope. whose letters of the 15th, 21th (of June), and the 1th of July have received. by that of the 15th thee has informed me of a sorrowful circumstance respecting thy dear cosin, a circumstance which by thee and many others I judge will not be soon forgotten. And altho thee and has been so kind as to inform me of some very important circumstances respecting the affares of the Country, yet I believe thee will not think strange of me if I say but little or nothing on that ssubject, as what little news I get is unly such as thee has heard thyself, for it is principally from the Westchester paper which is extracted from the papers of the City. I was at Ennoch Lewis's about three weeks ago and I think the boys are nether better contented there than they were last winter, for the rules are somewhat milder, they are now allowed to go to bed when they please. And as for going out of bounds I believe there is but little attention payd to  it, that I think Friend William, (altho I was so tired of it last winter) I could spend a few months more there very well. I believe about two thirds of the boys are such as ware there when I was and of think thy all appeared to be in good health.John Taylor was at our house a few days ago and informed me that he had lately received a letter from John Elliott, which stated that his brother that went into the Army was shot at the time of the battle at Far York. I understood he was not in the battle at the time he was shot, but was out some distance from the Army with a few others and ware met by about fourty Indian's, who immediately fired at them and killed nine. I understood Johns Brother rode about a mile on Horseback after he had received three shots. One in his arm and two in his body, He was then taken off his Horse. But expireed in a few minutes after one of our neighbour's had his barn burned a few days ago by the lightening and his crop was all burned in it which was to him a considerable loss as he was not in very affluent circumstances. I think Friend Cope if thy double letter had miscarried and been broken open by any person he or she would of seen something in it worth a laughing at. I mean the part respecting thy beard. I understand thee is so tormented with thy huge beard that thee has been studying what thee should get that would kill it. But as thee is not likely to get anything that will answer the purpose, thee has requested thyFriend to take up a resolution and to good for evil (that is for pulling his whiskers) by contriving something that will answer the 8th purpose. but of should not think it a friendly act to destroy that which nature has formed as an ornament for my Friend.

   Esteemed Friend William D Cope,
   
   I have received thy letter of the 30the of August which informes me that thee has accomplished thy journey Westward and is now at thy own home in Philadelphia. Therefore I now purpose writing thee a few lines by way of answer both to the above mentioned letter and that of the 25th of July. Friend Cope I judge thee thinks I am a very lazy fellow for nether meeting thee at West-Chester nor answering thy letter before this-time. but, as for the former I think I have a very good reason for I did not receive the intelligence of thee being there till about 5 days after the appointed time which was the only reason why I was not there for I would have been well pleased to of had the opurtunity of seeing my Friend by going the small distance of ten miles.but, altho thy friend was disappointed of the operturnity he thanks thee kindly for the invitation. The account thee has given me of Lancaster town is very similar to what I expected it was, but as for Columbia I did not expect its adjacent lands were so hilly, or, had such Mountains in them as thee mentions.I understand Friend E Lewis lately buried his son Ennoch with the flux. but I did not understan that the disorder has spread in the family.    
   With a hope that these lines may find thee in as good a state of health as I am in I conclude, and subscribe myself thy affectionate friend.

Newport, 8th mo., 18th. 1867.

Dear Father
I   thought I would write to thee this afternoon, in case I   should not get a chance before the steamer leaves.  Not that   I’m so very busy, but since I lie down every noon when I get   home from bathing in time, and in the evenings we have Mary   Williams’ lamp incased in the same little plain bonnet so   that we have no chance either to write or read after dark,   unless we take a lamp and go up stairs.  
On 6th day we   ordered the boat, but were not able to go out, on account of   the rain.  In the morning Alfred had the pleasure of   witnessing a little sail boat upset, the man who was in it   managed to get on the bottom untill a sail boat came to his   assistance.  In the afternoon the rain slackened some and we   made up quite a large party and hired the omnibus to go to   the south Shore and see if the horn spouted, we had George   and thecarriage beside.  When we got there the horn did not spout   at all, but the waves were very fine, and towards the latter   part of the time, when the sun came out, very beautiful the   sun shone on the spray making nearly half of a rainbow.  We   staid till quite late stopping on the way home at the   boathouse, the sea there was not nearly so fine though.  On   seventh day morning we made up a small fishing expedition,   consisting of Alf, Hazen, Tom Longstreth, George and myself.   We went about a mile above the poor house anchoring in a   little cove near the rail-road.  We had quite good luck, and   caught about 24 fish, including 2 star fish, several   Chaucksus, and one very fat eel, which I had the   gratification of catching.  Since we have been here we have   seen two very curious fish, one called an “old maid,” which   is about 1 foot long and white underneath; the other is a   “swell fish,” and looks very much like other fish, except   when you turn it over and rub it gentlyit becomes inflated and is puffed out like a small   air-baloon, it is about 6 inches long.  The fishermen on the   point have had a reading room and small library established   for their benefit in a back room looking out on the bay at   “Godderds,” (I don[t] know whether I have spelt it right or   not, but if thee pronounces it the way its spelt thee will   know where I mean) by a Miss or Mrs. Gibbs.  They take the   daily and some of the illustrated papers, and I noticed a   number of the “British Gardiner” I think it was on the   table.  Well to come to the point at once; uncle Harry was   invited to deliver a sort of a lecture to them on last 6th   day evening.  George Merrit seemed very desirous that the   ladies would come up and hear the discourse, which some of   them did.  The speech was very grand the subject being   “Water,” I dont know whether the fishermen properly   appreciated it, since I heard one remark afterwards that,   “it wouldtake a purty smart man to follow him.”  I believe uncle   Harry proposes to deliver some more during this week on   Light and Air.  20th 3rd day.  Yesterday we took a sail over   to the Dumplings and landed those that wanted to, the rest   of us going on down, towards Bever Tail.  This morning we   proposed sailing around Canonicut, recruits came in slowly   since they had been all finished by the expedition to the   Light ship, however as it turned out there was not enough   wind and we had to defer it untill tomorrow, and go bathing   instead.  This afternoon mother contemplates going sailing   if George thinks we are not going to have a squall; at   present it looks very much like rain.  I suppose Mother has   told thee all about the storm they have been having at home.   I hope we’ll not have it here.  And now since I have used up   my sheet I will stop.  affecty thy son

Philadelphia Sept. 1.   1896

Dear Frank.

I think it would be best to   prepare your paper this fall, and add what additional   information you may get in the future in the form of   “Notes.”

I think it best to call it “Breeding” or   “Summer” Birds of Susq. Co. and would therefore mention the   migrants or stragglers as the [Bothonotary?] in the   introductory part & not include such species in the body of   the listI shall be very glad to see your manuscript & make any   suggestions that may occur to me. It will be no trouble at   all! I think you are right about the [----] position of the   county.

Indeed I do not call to mind any Carolinian   elements. If there are any they must occur in much lower   ground than is found about Dimock. 

I shall be at the   Academy from now on as I returned from the Catskills last   week.

Sincerely yours

Witmer Stone

B – 4/11

Dear Mother & sisters,
I think I shall            take to writing to you in a journal form, as I often have            little times when I can sit down for a few minutes & no            longer.  I recd thy letter Carry of the 9th wh. was very            nice & also the cuffs, wh. were also very nice, & I am very            much obliged to whoever did ‘em & that person was mother I            reckon & it was very good of her & they were just what I            wanted. & now if you can only send me a white skirt, I shall            be so [g---] for I can hardly get along without, as I find            the one I brot will hardly bear another washing.
On 4th            day eve. I took tea at Mart. Chestons & had such a nice            time.  Altho’ she is so feeble that she washardly able to sit up all the even, she insisted upon      inviting a few others to make it pleasant for me – & I thot      it was so kind in her. The party consisted of H Lytle (who      is such a nice & good person) Julia Valentine Dr Thomas H.      King & Jesse – & we had such a nice home-like time, & such      an elegant tea & Ice cream & all.  I thought it the nicest      visit I have paid, & then in the evening as it was rainy she      wd. insist upon sending us home in the carriage & she asked      me so kindly to come there any time when I felt like it,      that I felt quite gratified.  It rained so much the      afternoon I was to go out to Careys – that it was deferred      so I have not been yet, & I believe I have’nt done anything      in particular else, since [---] wrote last.  While I think      of it Caroline Ill ans. thy questions. There are 200 chil’n      in our sch. & 4 teachers wh. makes 1 to every 50.  Mine is      the least advanced class & consequently the least      interesting.  Ages, frm. abt, 7 yrs. to 15 or 16. & strange      to say the smallest chil’n in my sch are generally the best      scholars. The greater proportion are boys, about a third      girls. They are children of this place who have not hitherto      had the advantage of free schools.
End of first sitting.3rd day – 18th
I have laid aside my letter for two or      three days, – for we have all felt so sad since hearing the      dreadful news that I cld. not feel like writing abt.      ordinary things & there seemed little to say on the one      great subject – the presidents dreadful death, wh. seemed      dreadful enough to strike every one dumb with horror &      astonishment.  It seemed so near to us, & the more so      because the very day after wh. it occurred we had planned to      make a little excursion to Washington for the day having      been invited by one of Miss M’s frds. who often goes down.       So you can judge of our horror when a few min. before      setting out, this dreadful intelligence was brot. to us. The      feeling here against the seccessionists has been intense as      they have been heard to rejoice in the sts. at thedreadful news, & to have prophesied a few days since that   our rejoicings wld. be turned to sorrow.  The city was under   martial law for a day or two – but by the strict vigilance   of the authorities was kept quiet.  but they compelled every   secessionist as well as union on the principal business sts   to drape their stores in mourning & [if] the appearance it   presents is very solemn & sad.  I suppose it is the same in   Phila. – & everywhere.  It seems really a more horrible   thing than some we have shrunk frm. reading in books of   history.  People here seem to be sanguine about the new   administration – & the prospects of peace, but that does not   take away frm. the horrible fact that there can exist in our   midst such a wicked & fiendish spirit.
4th day morn — our   school has been dismissed to day on account of the   solemnities wh. are to be observed in the churches &   elsewhere
We also had a holliday on 2nd day & Jesse Tyson   very kindly took advantage of it to take us a very beautiful   ride to a lake abt. 7 miles frm. here wh. is situated among   hills & woods as beautiful as any Iever saw.  I had no idea there was anything of the kind so   near to the city.  It was delightful to get a sight of the   beautiful spring in the country.  The trees are just putting   out their first leaves, & look so lovely, & we cld. not but   enjoy it in spite of the mournful circumstances wh. have   been so much in our minds,  Jesse took us past his place,   where he wishes to erect his model house.  It is a very   beautiful situation indeed with views of the city & the bay   &c.
I suppose you (that is some of you) are in the midst   of yearly meeting now. but the sad newsmust have thrown a great damp over every thing.
We have   been spending two or three afternoons this week at the   meeting house sewing for the refugees.  The friends have a   sewing machine there, & meet every day this week to sew.  &   they will get a good deal accomplished no doubt.  Julia   Valentine seems to be very active & is a very nice frd.  I   [am] [you] [will] try to call on [Tamy] Miller when she is   in P again as she — Aunt has been so kind in asking me to   come out there &c.
Clementine Cope.
If you can find   out when [Tamy] will be in P I have no doubt she wld. bring   any package.  I want to go out this morning to get one or   two thins so I will bring my letter to a close.  Hope I   shall get one frm. you today but suppose you have felt   unlike writing as I have.  But for this, I shd. have written   to Tom this week, tell him.  Give my love to Cous. T. & all   enquiring frds. am glad to hear you miss me a little some   times.  Yours affec Clemmy
I miss you very much

Awbury –
April 2.nd.

Dearest Lilly –
I don’t   know what thee has thought of me for not thanking thee   before for thy Most generous Contribution to our Collection   for the Colored Summer Home –  it came on the day of the   evening when Jonnie was stricken. & I forgot about it   entirely until the following Tuesday, the day of our   Collection, & I should have sat downright then & written. but Anna was writing to thee & I sent   a message. & thought I would wait until I had more time to   write a longer letter.  but that time has scarce seemed to   come until now!  We have just finished dining at Mother’s –   & while Mother is engaged in her usual occupation with the   dishes in the pantry. I had sat down in the library with Tom   & Will who are both reading. to write to thee.  Anna was so   long ingetting her letter off to thee.  I imagine the Contents told   everything up to within a day or two –  Chellie is very   wonderful,– perfectly calm & like herself –  but she looks   badly – & I fear as the days go on & she realizes more &   more what has happened. that she will show it even more –   but she is blessed with four devoted Sons who are looking   after her in every way –  Miss Richardson of Course, as thee   knows is with them – & they kept theNurse, whom they had for Jonnie, until yesterday.  Anna too   keeps well. & so far is entirely natural – but Miss   Richardson watches her like a hawk. & never lets her be   alone long – they want her to go away.– but she does not   want to.– & Miss R. told me yesterday that they would not   insist upon it – which I am glad of – for I think we cannot   always judge what is best for others at these   times.
Mother, I am thankfulto say, is very well – & with Anna & my being here   alternately she has gotten along very well with the new maid   whom Anna got for her – but of course she is not a Companion   – or a trained nurse – and I think we are going to be able   to get Susan Stewart out next week for a few weeks until she   (Susan) goes to the Hospital –  We may be able to keep her   until Mother goes to North East, but thatI Cannot say –  Chellie was in hopes that Mother would   [heed] this nurse who has been with her this week.  & if she   liked her to have her go to Northeast with her.  but Mother   was strongly opposed to it –  I think largely because she   was a stranger – now we had proposed Miss Moses’ name.  &   she wants her –  So I expect she will be gotten –  I had had   a talk with her. & she is entirely willing to undertake it   if she is wanted. & both Mother & Tomseem to want it – tho’ Tom says he wants nothing except what   Mother wants –  The trouble is about Miss Moses she will   have to [leave] Mother to be home by the first of October –    I am quite sure she will be a very devoted nurse – and I   think it will be very hard for Mother to let her go –  I   only wish we could get a permanency –  Before Jonnie died   Miss R. had told Mother that she would come back to her in   the fall. & I think Mother ishoping for that –  but I feel that is not to be counted   upon.
Please forgive such a lenghty epistle –  Mother has   now returned from the pantry – the men have departed & I   must say goodbye to thee –
Please give my love to Ellie &   much for thyself –
from thy loving sister

Dear father
I rec’d   thy letter 5th day morning.  Thy accounts quite make me wish   to see England some time although I dont know that that time   will ever come.  On 4th day we sailed round Canonicut, and   since Lilly says she has given thee a condensed account of   our trip, I will copy our log by way of variety.  The   officers were: Capt. Geo. F Merritt, 1st mate T.P. Cope Jr   2nd mate A Cope Jr; Seaman T.K. Longstreth, Cabin boy F.H.   Cope.  Steward M. C Collins.  Cook V. Hartshorne and 6   passengers, A Newhall, M Newhall, M Farnum, H Carter, M.   Collins, & E.S. Cope.
Log of the Canonicut Party – Yacht   “TCope [Deferred]”
(Rations limited)
Started from the   pier at 8 1/2, A.M., arrived at the lighthouse at 8.40.   there met M.C. Cope and party in a row boat, who wished us   joy,and desired us to report all new discoveries; soon after we   commenced telling fortunes.  2 m. of 9 o’clock saw a   porpoise on the starboard side.  9.22. off fort Adams,   weather, calm, thin canopy of clouds, at this moment it was   proposed to “put more steam on.”  Three persons forward of   the “Lobster Box.”  progress, “slow but awfully sure.”  10.   o’clock, interesting information concerning the compass, by   Capt. Merritt.  surf seen at Bever Tail, fears entertained   for the health of the party.  Some excitement caused by the   appearance of two fish, which produced restlessness on the   part of the cabin boy –  10.11. opposite the Dumplings.  11   o’clock opposite Castle Hill the game of quintettes played   with interest by the 1st mate, cook, and several of the   passengers; the steward seiged with headache – at this time   doubts were expressed by the captain as to the probability   of the winds changing before 6 P.M. weather still calm.  [8]   m after 11. met a sailing vessel commanded by captain Henry   Merritt, rowed by the capt. and sculled by Henry Merritt jr   who hailed us, and threw a small lobster into the boat one   of the passengers was badly bitten which caused great   excitement untill she was rescued from the jaws of the   carnivorous creature.  11 1/2 A.M. Slight windthe South and visible, stood off to welcome it.  Party   regaled themselves with rations. 12. M. South wind   continues.  candy handed.  Met a schooner and were saluted   by a dog on board.  Long swells, health good.  12.10.   conversation on the weather prohibited– a number of the   passengers retired to rest – Cabin boy reclining on a   passenger–  cook on the dinner basket–  1st mate absorbed in   a book.  12.45. Point Judith lighthouse in sight.  After   serious consideration it was decided to pursue our journey   on which account three cheers were given.  12.50. Passing   Bever Tail.  three more cheers – passengers happy – saluted   by the horn and a towel was waved to us, which compliment   was returned passengers waving handkerchiefs.  2. P.M.   Dinner – great dispute on the subject of ringing the   triangle.  2.45. from “Lobster Box” end–  dinner   accomplished satisfactorily leaving the voyagers in a   quiescent state of mind–  dinner consisted of 9 courses   closed with sour-drops–  opposite M. Williams’- Bay   comparatively speaking very rough!  Fast passing Wickford –   Slight excitement Fortunes being told again aft. The 1st   mate has just restored the cabin to order, after dinner.    Aft becoming very impudent.  Bow hair dressing.  1st matesweeping and thereby discomboberating all – 2.55. Patience   in sight.  sentiment in the bow, 3.12. Approaching the end   of Canonicut Greenwich off the larboard bow.  Patience and   Rocky Pt. ahead.  the breeze delightful, and all of the   party very comfortable, some reading, some working zephyr   work.  3.20. Rounding the north end of Canonicut.  Three   cheers given by all the party.  3.35. P.M. Rounding   Canonicut.  Newport in view – on our homeward trip – breeze   good.  some of the party wishing to land we are going to (we   did’nt) 3.38. Met the Providence steamboat- Needless anxiety   on the part of the passengers.  Now dashing gaily towards   Newport.  3.55 Proceeding fondly – just played games of   authors and consequences.  3 m. of 5.P.M. off the   Lighthouse. health good.  Fine breeze- Band tuning up for a   song before we reach the pier.  Arrived at the pier at   5.P.M.  On first day evening we took a walk to Tammany Hill.   we started after a 6 o’clock tea but were not able to get   there untill dark or dusk.  It is the first time I was ever   there.  We saw the lights at Point Judith, the Light Ship,   Bever Tail and the Break water.  Yesterday was splendidlyclear.  In the morning we took a short float, I cant call it   a sail there wasn’t any wind, after which we went bathing.    In the afternoon I made up a small sailing party consisting   of Alice Carter, Abby Newhall, Tom Longstreth and Alfred, we   went out to the Dumplings and landed, & afterwards came back   to take Caroline Mary her first sail.  She could’nt have had   a more pleasant evening it neither too cold nor too warm, &   there was a splendid breeze.  We went around Rose Island and   got back in good season.  though not strictly obeying her   mothers instructions about being home at half past 6.  This   morning we went bathing as usual and also engaged the boat,   Alfred preferring to go to Coddingtons Cove to bathing.    Thee will observe that I’ve been getting about as much good   out of boating as possible this season.  Since we arrived   Alf has become a staunch friend of Geo. Merritt’s and Hazen   of Geo. Barlow’s. Its quite remarkable how devoted Alf is,   he spends the big parts of his time at the reading room with   George.  This morning I got a new key fitted, formy valise, having lost the other since my arrival.  We were   not able to mail these letters in time to go by the [La---]   so they will have to take their chance by going via New   York.  There are 24 folks going to Philadelphia the night we   go, which will make a pretty effectual change in Mary   Williams’ boarders, and there will be no one left but Tom   Longstreth to do the honors of the occasion.  We are rather   puzzled as to what to do if we were left by the 7 o’clock   train from New York, since the 10 o’clock train has been   taken off the line.  We will have to run the risk, I   suppose, of getting the 8.40, Washington train, stopped at   Frankford.  Having run out of news and since mother is also   writing I will stop.
affecty thy son

Philada 8th. mo 1st. 1831

I dare say, my dear sister,   thee has felt inclined since we parted, sometimes, to apply   to me the old adage with regard to promising people vis.   that, 
“A ready maker
Is a ready breaker:”
since   the offer to write to thee was entirely voluntary on my   part, and yet I have suffered two weeks, nearly, to pass   without making an effort to fulfil my engagement.- As usual,   I am rich in excuses--the most prominent of which, is the   impossibility I found in obtaining a certain direction to my   letter; and either imagining the epistle, when completed,   would be too valuable to be thrown away, or else deeming, (I   did not stop to analyze feelings), my time too precious to   be expended upon that which would profit my correspondant   nothing, I concluded to defer writing altogether, until   Henry came up to this, our quarterly   solemnity.---

And now, having got thro’ the most   important and generally most stupid part of epistolary   communications, vis. the preface, let me dash at once into   my stock of news, and  cull for thy benefit such pieces of   information as will be likely to interest thee. I greatly   fear the selection will be a small one, for summer is a   particularly unsocial season, unless it is with our most   intimate friends and of course, we hear but little of what   is passing in
the world without.- I suppose thee will say it is respecting   the movements of friends thee would wish to be informed; and   if they would only do something, in the least degree, and of   the common line, I should take great pleasure in   transmitting an account of it to thee; but they are all   pursuing their usual routine of occupations, enjoying   themselves in a most provoking state of quiescence, and   doing and saying nothing that would give use to any   comments.----- Maryann tarried about two weeks at [Calcon]-   Hook, and she says passed her time very pleasantly,   notwithstanding the ungracious sounds, issuing from young   master Frank’s mouth, which occasionally saluted her   maidenly ears.-- I believe she could say, very pathetically,   “I am never merry when I hear such music,” she thinks, I   imagine, that we need never apprehend consumption in the   case of our little nephew, adopting, as I opine she does,   Anna Braithwaites favorite maxim that all our faculties,   bodily as well as mental, may be “strengthened by reason of   use”.-- Father, Mother, the aforenamed cousin, and myself,   spent a day with Caroline not long since.-- She seems quite   comfortable and very well; she is fattening on cottage   cheese and “lovely, rich cream.” and fortifying her bodily   powers by riding frequently on horse-back- Her darling son   looks admirably, walks boldly  alone and chatters at a most   rapid rate.* [Note at bottom edge of page: “lest thee should   be led into the mistake of supposing him, even a more   marvellous child than he really he is, I must state that his   conversations are carried on in a language peculiar to   himself, and are quite unintelligible to ordinary   hearers----“] I must do him the justice to say that he   behaved himself very gentlemanly during the whole period of   our visit and struttedabout in his apron of thy purchasing, (with which, by the   bye, he is delighted), with quite the air of a person of   importance---------

We had a considerable collection   of friends at our mansion during the whole time of the   conference—Jeremiah Hubard and his wife, two female friends   from Providence, and cousin A. Barker lodged with us, and   they attracted others during the day—so that we had a real   miniature yearly meeting-- With the consignment from your   house, we were all, I believe, much amused—Oh! if thee had   but been present at the relation of their courtship given by   the husband, and heard the gentle, deprecatory tone in which   the wife endeavored to ward off the narration, & the very   singular intonation of her voice in her exclamations of “oh,   Jeremiah, now dont”!! It was absolutely irresistible!—She   has now gone with “cousin [Nat]” to visit her relations in   Virginia, and her better half has taken refuge from the   intolerable heat of our city, at Joel Woolman’s.—Now this, I   should say was “a bitter change, severer for severe,” for a   more exposed, comfortless-looking country dwelling I have   seldom seen than the residence of this same   milkman.--------

I hope the purchases I have made for   thee will prove satisfactory—the cambric, I procured as   nearly like Henry’s cravat as I could.—Do take notice of the   beautiful picture on the cologne water bottle.- I have often   heard of the angel of health coming with healing in his   --
wings, but the idea of being kicked into “salubrity” (to use   Caleb’s phrase), is quite novel, and from the position in   which the ministering spirit here stands, I should suppose   the virtue lay in his heels—Uncle Jaspar’s family have been   very regularly heard from.—Abbeyann is much better but   Uncle’s eye still continues bad and they fear he will be   obliged to have an operation performed when they reach   Cincinnati.- I saw Martha on sixth day and never saw her   look better--- Mother is somewhat improved—She and Father   have at last fixed upon this week for leaving home.- the   latter part of it I expect.—Mary Stokes is added to the   party---- I have almost filled my sheet and have not said a   word about the fire we had had—It was “horribly beautiful”   but terribly allarming 

Rachel R. Cope
DealI must refer thee to Henry for particulars.---- I am glad to  hear the boys areenjoying themselves-- Give my love to them and tell them not  to be tooventuresome.-- I dislike apologies about letters, but in  looking over this I cannotbut be struck with the triffling nature of its  contents.—However, the weather is too warm to be  intellectual, even supposing I had it in my power, and it is  only on rare occasions that I am sentimental. Such as it is,  I hope thee will deem it worthy an early reply to thy  attached sister

do not want thee at home till thee gets better--and get   along pretty well without thee, I don't suppose Aunt Rachel   fares quite so well as if thee were here--but I do try to do   my best--Cousin Elizbt's letter of last eving told thee she   was'nt quite well--she is some better to-day--and I hope   tomorrow will be better still--(Oh my! There--I've actually   fallen asleep over my letter--thee wont feel much   complimented I'm afraid) Tell Clemmy we got her first   letter--and think we are very remiss not to have   ex[patiated] on its sweetness for [-]

Oh my!

7th mo. 28th. 1867.

Dear Father
Lilly and Chelly having been keeping up such an active correspondence by the last two steamers, I thought I would reserve my efforts untill they had got through. 
We received a letter from uncle Tom inclosing a letter from thee informing us of the loss of thy masticators, it      would have been remarkably unfortunate if thee had not had      an extra set with thee.  I hope by this time thee is      enjoying thyself on terra firma, but since the difference of      time between where thee is and where we are is so great, we      find it hard to guess what thee is about.  We received letters from home last night, dated the 25th., saying they   were all well and preparing to leave for Newport on 5th day.   Mother had also received a letter from thee mailed at   Halifax
On last 6th day we rode to Stony Clove, an   entirely new place to me, about 10 miles distant.  The road   is quite rough, and runs between two mountains, one of which   rises almost perpendicularly about 1000 ft, as near as we   could judge, and on each side there are large rocks under   which we found ice: they say the sun never gets there and   the ice under the rocks never melts during the summer.  On   approaching this place the air becomes perceptably cooler   and on leaving it becomes warm again.  We took dinner at a   little farm house and although it was plain weenjoyed it very much.  After dinner we had to leave right   away for home.  Going back we had a splendid view of those   distant mountains you see on your way to the Plauterkill   Clove.
Yesterday morning we, that is Tom Stokes, Harry,   some other gentlemen and myself, walked down to Bastion   Falls to take a bath, thee remembers what a fine basin there   is at the foot of the falls, well it was there we went in;   the water was pretty cool on first going in but after we had   been in a little while, and had kicked around a good bit we   got quite warm and all in a glow.  We went under the fall   where it hit the rocks for a second time, but even there the   water stung like hail-stones, and I preferredthe pool to getting such a warming as that.  In the      afternoon we walked over to the Mountain House to see the      view, on starting it was beautifully clear but when we had      gone about half way, two clouds, very considerately, came      rolling down upon us, one from North and one from South      mountain, and by the time we got to the precipice both the      view and ourselves were completely mistified; we accordingly      went into the House and got weighed, and since thee will not      object to hearing how much some of the members of thy      immediate family weigh, I will give thee part of the      table:
R.R.C.  125 lbs.   E.S.C.  98 lbs.   T.P.C.  90      lbs.     Rachel has gained 7 lbs. since last sum- mer, and its becoming quite dreadful; I'm afraid, if she      goes on gaining, we will be obliged to have her put up in a      barrel and roll her home from Newport.  Tom Stokes, Ellie,      Madjie, and Walter are going home tomorrow morning: the rest      of us expect to leave here fourth day and go to Albany, we      will stay there that night, and go to Boston the next day;      leaving Boston 6th. day afternoon we will arrive at Newport      in time for tea.  I suppose mother has told thee that she      succeeded in engaging both the Georges during our stay      there.  The weather here has been very warm and showery; to      day it is very pleasant but it has been so very showery we      were afraid to try going to walk. Aunt Lizzie received two letters from the Adirondacks to      day one from cousin Clemmy and one from aunt Annie, giving      an account of a trip which they had taken to lake Placid by      the way of John Brown's grave; aunt Annie said the grave was      very plain, there was a tombstone with some engraving on it      and on a boulder nearby was the plain inscription "John      Brown - 1859."  She also said cousin Clemmy was a good deal      stronger and was able to bear fatigue as well as the rest of      them  They were both very much surprised to hear of thy      sudden leaving for England.  Lilly and Chelly send their      love.  We are all well and have had a most splendid time      considering that our "pa" is on the other side of the Atlantic and now having given thee   all the news I can remember I will   stop.
affectionately
thy son Thos P. Cope Jr

I      promised thy little brother to add a postscript to his      letter, inasmuch as he thought he should be unable to fill      the sheet – but he has left me so much room that I believe I      shall have to call in William’s aid to clothe the preceding      page –  Thos. has been in the parlor for a day or two, in      consequence of a bruise he has received on his eye –  It was      occasioned entirely by an accidental blow from a stick in      the hand of one of his companions, & seem’d at first rather      disposed to be troublesome – but by a faithful application      of lead-water yesterday it is nearly recovered – so nearly      that it occasions no inconvenience, & is but slightly      discoloured –  He seems to think that eye is particularly      unfortunate, as it is the same one which was hurt some time      ago –  I do not think thy mother need feel uneasy about it,      as we shall try to take all necessary care of him, if any      more is needed –  In regard to being careful himself, he      needs some few cautions, tis true – but I will tell it to      his credit, that for an active, adventurous little boy he is      very well disposed to take advice – & when he makes promises      to adopt it, is, I believe, very scrupulous in fulfilling      them.  He has beguiled some of the hours of his confinement      in doors, by reading “Rollo’s vacation” to me – & we have      found it quite entertaining –  I think it arrived just at      the right moment –  So much for Thomas –.  now for Willie –      with whom I am becoming better acquaintedas the ice is now broken – & he frequently pays us a visit      in our parlor –  He tells me – he is more comfortable than      formerly – & that the cause of his unhappiness is re-moved –      what this cause was, I do not know – but he looks so      pleasant & happy that I am inclined to believe he is not      depressed by any great weight of troubles –  They are very      different boys but both have found means to interest me      warmly for them – & I think I shall not soon cease to love      them – Tom is sitting by me begging me to proceed – but the      end of my paper warns me that I may already have tired thee      – therefore will take the hint after desiring my love to thy      mother – and assuring thee of

I      promised thy little brother to add a postscript to his      letter, inasmuch as he thought he should be unable to fill      the sheet – but he has left me so much room that I believe I      shall have to call in William’s aid to clothe the preceding      page –  Thos. has been in the parlor for a day or two, in      consequence of a bruise he has received on his eye –  It was      occasioned entirely by an accidental blow from a stick in      the hand of one of his companions, & seem’d at first rather      disposed to be troublesome – but by a faithful application      of lead-water yesterday it is nearly recovered – so nearly      that it occasions no inconvenience, & is but slightly      discoloured –  He seems to think that eye is particularly      unfortunate, as it is the same one which was hurt some time      ago –  I do not think thy mother need feel uneasy about it,      as we shall try to take all necessary care of him, if any      more is needed –  In regard to being careful himself, he      needs some few cautions, tis true – but I will tell it to      his credit, that for an active, adventurous little boy he is      very well disposed to take advice – & when he makes promises      to adopt it, is, I believe, very scrupulous in fulfilling      them.  He has beguiled some of the hours of his confinement      in doors, by reading “Rollo’s vacation” to me – & we have      found it quite entertaining –  I think it arrived just at      the right moment –  So much for Thomas –.  now for Willie –      with whom I am becoming better acquaintedas the ice is now broken – & he frequently pays us a visit      in our parlor –  He tells me – he is more comfortable than      formerly – & that the cause of his unhappiness is re-moved –      what this cause was, I do not know – but he looks so      pleasant & happy that I am inclined to believe he is not      depressed by any great weight of troubles –  They are very      different boys but both have found means to interest me      warmly for them – & I think I shall not soon cease to love      them – Tom is sitting by me begging me to proceed – but the      end of my paper warns me that I may already have tired thee      – therefore will take the hint after desiring my love to thy      mother – and assuring thee of

I      promised thy little brother to add a postscript to his      letter, inasmuch as he thought he should be unable to fill      the sheet – but he has left me so much room that I believe I      shall have to call in William’s aid to clothe the preceding      page –  Thos. has been in the parlor for a day or two, in      consequence of a bruise he has received on his eye –  It was      occasioned entirely by an accidental blow from a stick in      the hand of one of his companions, & seem’d at first rather      disposed to be troublesome – but by a faithful application      of lead-water yesterday it is nearly recovered – so nearly      that it occasions no inconvenience, & is but slightly      discoloured –  He seems to think that eye is particularly      unfortunate, as it is the same one which was hurt some time      ago –  I do not think thy mother need feel uneasy about it,      as we shall try to take all necessary care of him, if any      more is needed –  In regard to being careful himself, he      needs some few cautions, tis true – but I will tell it to      his credit, that for an active, adventurous little boy he is      very well disposed to take advice – & when he makes promises      to adopt it, is, I believe, very scrupulous in fulfilling      them.  He has beguiled some of the hours of his confinement      in doors, by reading “Rollo’s vacation” to me – & we have      found it quite entertaining –  I think it arrived just at      the right moment –  So much for Thomas –.  now for Willie –      with whom I am becoming better acquaintedas the ice is now broken – & he frequently pays us a visit      in our parlor –  He tells me – he is more comfortable than      formerly – & that the cause of his unhappiness is re-moved –      what this cause was, I do not know – but he looks so      pleasant & happy that I am inclined to believe he is not      depressed by any great weight of troubles –  They are very      different boys but both have found means to interest me      warmly for them – & I think I shall not soon cease to love      them – Tom is sitting by me begging me to proceed – but the      end of my paper warns me that I may already have tired thee      – therefore will take the hint after desiring my love to thy      mother – and assuring thee of
the friendship of thy      affectionate

My dear Jonnie,

We have not heard from   the crime paper. Edward, however, I happen to know has a   [--] in it, as Mikell used his paper as a model for the   person he secured to read the other papers. This is not   publicinformation, though there is no reason why Edward should not   know. You ought to be proud of that boy. He has not only   done well -- he has done splendidly, and I understand that   either he or his friend Kratz leads the class with higher   marks than we have given in the first year for several   years. Good brains have helped, - but hard steady work has   been the realfactor. Two things gave me special satisfaction; one that I   did not know his handwriting, and the other that I had   marked him higher than anyone else in my subject, writing   across the face of his paper just after reading it: “a Jim   dum dandy man”. 

Father is a great deal better – up   and about. I have just returned from Narragansett. Weather   perfect here.uppose it is also with you. All send   love.

Affectionately

Dear Chellie –
I was very sorry not to answer thy note      myself, but under the circumstances knew thee would not      expect it.  But Mother wrote thee I suppose all that was      necessary –  If thee will write to me a little nearer the      timeand tell us when & where to meet Mary Jane and her trunk I      shall be much obliged.  If she should turn out a      satisfactory nurse for the children, I should be very much      pleased.  Of course, I shall be with them most of the time      myself too, as I fear I belong to the [measy] class of      mothers.  We have beenwanting a Protestant nurse as my experience with the      Romanists is that when pushed to the wall they will      sometimes tell an untruth.  I thought of giving Mary J.      $2.00 a week for the first two months & $2.50 for the next      two.  Then if she should not wish to go home with you, & I      should wish to keep her, she would be entitled to full      nurse’s wages.  Won’t thee please tell me what that ought to      be?  The nurses from New York here get such an enormous      amount that I thought she might be willing to take what the      Philadelphia nurses do -  Her duties will be most of the      care of the babies, the mending, & a few things of the      baby’s to wash; this with her own wash & her own room will      be about all.
Then, as we have never had a Protestant      servant, there is anotherquestion I want to ask.  Would she probably be satisfied to      go to Church in the evening regularly instead of 1st day      morning?  Then I could go myself in the morning – and what      shall I give her in the way of “days out”?  I don’t know      anything about nurses but our two other servants expect an      afternoon a week and most of every other Sunday –  Now this      wouldbe very inconvenient for a nurse to do; & if she would be      satisfied with any thing less, it would be better.  I am      anxious to begin the way we mean to keep on, as changing      ones rules after once starting is not very easy to do.
If      it is not too much bother I should be ever so much obliged      if thee would adviseme a little on these points –
Baby [William] & I are      doing very well.  We think him a great addition to the      family.  The weather is not sufficiently mild yet for him to      don Anna’s pretty little cap & take a stroll, but it will      not be long before we will both be out in the fields –
I      am so glad you are to be in the Dea’s [Cotage] this summer –      It is quite accessible from here & I shall often get hold of      Anna –
In haste Believe me
Affectionately      Thine

Dear Net,
I have just got thy   letter of the 1st to the 19th inclusive, (where has it been   so long?)  Its very well I did’nt go on with the great scold   I began yesterday — I thot, I wld defer it one day longer &   see – Why I dont believe you know how long you’ve been   neglecting me, & thee must remember while thee’s   journalizing that thy writing every day is’nt my getting   it,.  However it was very interesting if not very late news.   Thee does’nt say a word about having got either of my last   letters,  I hope the one containing my elaborate sketch of   the Environs of the city & my room as a centre, did not get   lost, as it wld. have been a waste of artistic   effort.
The presidents death has indeed made mourning in   our land.  The ways of Providence are very inscrutable.  I   told you in my last letter of the feeling produced here, so   I will notrevert to it..  The day of the funeral procession here was   very solemn.  We dismissed our school, & went by particular   invitation to where we cld. have an excellent view of the   whole as it passed, at the store of an old gentleman in   market st, where we had a room to ourselves & refreshments   provided wh. seemed rather singular but is his custom.  It   was the most touching & mournful procession I ever saw    Perhaps you saw it in Phila.  It will take a long time to   forget the grief & horror of this sad event,– but work has   to be done & yesterday our sch. began [afresh] after the   interruptions of the week before, & while sch. lasts we are   forced to forget every thing but the work before us.  It is   what you might call intense work. & wld. be wearing [--]   [----] [----] if incessant.  Thy description of getting   home, & the nice clean room & all most made me home-sick.  I   miss great many of the little home luxuries and cleannesses   here,– but cannot expect to have them in boarding.  We dont   get any good Mrs [Mcaff--] [----] [butter] &c — excepting   when we get invited out to our rich frds.
I was perfectly   charmed with my visit at Carey’s last 6th day night.  Their   place is perfectly magnificent & the house keeping   altogether princely compared to this.  I went out in the   afternoon & returned next morning.  Their house situated on   the tip top of a [very] hill seems like something up in the   air, & the view splendidSusan Carey has gone to Phil. & expects to return next 7 or   2 day.  She very kindly offered to bring anything for me —   said she wld. have room for any sized bundle, so that I   might get my silk skt.  But it is so late in the season that   I think I can do without it, & I shd. not like to ask her to   bring so large a thing.  I wld. like tho’ to have my old   blk. silk body & I wish thee wld send me a little brown   grenadine bag of horse hair in the right hand corner of my   upper beaureau drawer.  These things however are not very   important, & you need not send them if inconvenient.+    [+Perhaps you can send them by T Miller instead.]  S Carey   stays at Anthony Kimbers cor. 13. & Arch.  I yesterday recd   the skt. sent by Alford Coale for wh. I am much obliged.    Mary Pennyman called yesterday & was very pleasantLizzie Hopkins of the house where Lizzie Edge, Jenny Harris   &c staid, called to see me also, & some Matthews wh. lives   in the country said Lizzie E had written to her that I was   here & that she intended to invite me out to her place in   the country, a very pleasant one I understand.  A gentleman   called here night before last — Miller M Kim whom you have   perhaps heard of — one of the Freedmens board in Phila. &   [----] me a message frm. Cous. Frank whom he had seen the   day before.  Tho’ a stranger he seemed quite like somebody   from home.  To night I am going with H Lytle to the frds.   bible class, meeting at Dr. Thomas’ — it is attended by   frds. mostly, altho’ Ellen Carey who is an episcopalean &   one or two others attend.  They say it is very interesting,   tho’ I have’nt been before.  A few days ago I went to hear   Thomas Beecher a (brother of H Wards) speak, but was   disappointed, as it was nothing very interesting.     I cld.   not make out by thy journal exactly when your visit to Aunt   C’s began or ended, but am glad you had a nice time.  Give   my love to them & tell them I hope they’ll ans. my note.    Love also to Cous. F & M.  You were quite enterprising to   walk up to Athensville.  I am going to try & write to Tom

Dear Cousins,

By the permission of grandmother, I   take this opportunity of indulging myself in writing a few   line to you, which I should have done previous to this and   in a more particular manner, but my time has been pretty   generally occupied; and as my health has not for this some   time past been as good as formerly, I have not given so much   attention to my promise of writing to you as I otherwise   should have done –  The City in general is unusually   healthy, which I hope is not a presage to any malignant   fever: The weather is not at present very favourable after   so much rain, it is too warm–
Arthur I expect will sail   in a few days for St Thomas’s, where he intends selling   vessel and cargo, the sale of the former will depend upon   the price she will bring –  The voyage will be attended with   less danger than the former one to Cape Francois; they will   be liable it is true, to be taken by the English and French,   by the former because the port is a French one, by the   latter because they had been to the Cape; however if they   are careful to avoid all vessels in due time and conceal the   name of the sloop and her having been to Hayti they will   escapebeing captured–  The Sloop sails very fast [and] will in all   probability reach the port without any accident from man;   the fast sailing of the vessel will not quell a storm: then   thay must use their skill, do what lies in their power and   not be dismayed–
One would almost be induced to suppose   that nothing new or strange can take place, that every thing   that is extraordinary has past, and that the mine of wonder   is exhausted, for there is nothing but a series of old   occurrences revolving upon the face of the inhabitable and   navigable world–  Here I must resign my pen, and close this   uninteresting scrawl, with wishing you the blessing of   health and happiness –
I remain your affectionate   cousin

Dear Cousins,

By the permission of grandmother, I   take this opportunity of indulging myself in writing a few   line to you, which I should have done previous to this and   in a more particular manner, but my time has been pretty   generally occupied; and as my health has not for this some   time past been as good as formerly, I have not given so much   attention to my promise of writing to you as I otherwise   should have done –  The City in general is unusually   healthy, which I hope is not a presage to any malignant   fever: The weather is not at present very favourable after   so much rain, it is too warm–
Arthur I expect will sail   in a few days for St Thomas’s, where he intends selling   vessel and cargo, the sale of the former will depend upon   the price she will bring –  The voyage will be attended with   less danger than the former one to Cape Francois; they will   be liable it is true, to be taken by the English and French,   by the former because the port is a French one, by the   latter because they had been to the Cape; however if they   are careful to avoid all vessels in due time and conceal the   name of the sloop and her having been to Hayti they will   escapebeing captured–  The Sloop sails very fast [and] will in all   probability reach the port without any accident from man;   the fast sailing of the vessel will not quell a storm: then   thay must use their skill, do what lies in their power and   not be dismayed–
One would almost be induced to suppose   that nothing new or strange can take place, that every thing   that is extraordinary has past, and that the mine of wonder   is exhausted, for there is nothing but a series of old   occurrences revolving upon the face of the inhabitable and   navigable world–  Here I must resign my pen, and close this   uninteresting scrawl, with wishing you the blessing of   health and happiness –
I remain your affectionate   cousin

1st day eve

My dear   Mother

I had to leave off writing very suddenly last   time, as thee must have seen by the letter having no   direction.  We got to writing in bed at West Point as we   woke up early, & were not going to take breakfast till 8   1/2; but we had to go at 9 1/2, & as we were very pokey we   did not get down to breakfast till 9 o’clock-hence my great   hurry.  We left West P. in the boat, the rest of the way up   the Hudson was not however nearly so interesting, we soon   got out of the Highlands & then it seemed very tame.  This   is the most magnificent place we were ever, or are likely   ever, to be in; The view from the front of the house is very   extencive & beautifulfrom one place we can see the top of Mount Washington with   the opera glass.  The house is quite a large one tho’ mostly   old fashioned except the parlor wh. is up stairs, & has I   think most probably been altered the passages are the most   intricate I ever was in, & sometimes I feel completely lost.   We are on the very top of the mountain with dreadful   prespicise’s all around us, & it is the most dreadful place   to get up to that ever was, thee knows its a twelve miles   drive up the mountain from the landing, & how long does thee   ’spose we were getting up? 5 1/2 hours- just think of it the   horses walked nearly all the way, & stoped ever few   minut[e]s to rest; after we got fairly to the foot of the   mountain within about three miles from the house father &   Tom got out to walk, “& the consequence was” they got here   an hour & a quarter before us.the last part of the way poor Rach, was dreadfully sick, the   boat & stage together were too much for her, & as soon as we   got there I helped her get right to bed, she slept pretty   well however after she once did get to sleep tho’ she   suffered dreadfully poor child, thee knows her headaches are   so hard to bear, but don’t worry she’s quite well to day.    This morning they had service in the parlor to wh. Cous.   Clem, Chell & I went with papa’s leave. the sermon was   pretty good & I must confess I think it much better that   poking round all 1st day & going no where, if you can’t go   to meeting go to church – “thems my sentiments.”  After   service we all went out to take a ramble & after a good deal   of hunting round for paths & scrambling up them when found,   we at last arrivedat the top of South Mountain It was a beautiful walk   although it seemed to scare poor aunt Annie terribly to see   us so near the edge of these awful prespicise’s wh. surround   us every where; the rocks covered with ferns, mosses,   litgens are really beautiful.  We passed through what they   call “[Pudding]–stone Hall” a large cleft in the rocks   formed of pudding–stone & also through the lemon-squeezers   another crevise.  We are altogether enjoying ourselves very   much I think & propose staying here till 3rd day afternoon   when we will probably leave for Saratog[a], & thence to Lake   George.  at least those are present prospects but as we have   changed our plans several times to day I wont say certainly,   if we p[u]rsue the plan now proposed wewill stop at Belloes Falls on our way to Boston & spend   next 1st day at Nahant if we can.  We have rather a funny   time altogether about our meals & sleeping apartments here   things are not extremely clean, & it is so crowded we have   to come to the second table & therefore have to take our   breakfast at ten & dinner at four & now about 6 the supper   bell has rung, but I ‘spose we’ll come second class there   to.  We are quite glad of our thick dresses Mother, & have   worn nothing else hardly since we left home.  its right cold   to night, & we have to wear shawls & things all the time to   keep warm.  It is getting almost to dark for me towrite any more dear Mother so I think the[e] must let me   close.  I hope we shall hear from home tomorrow we want to   hear very much how you all are.  I shall try to write soon   again if we get to a stopping place  we have been going so   steadily that there has been hardly any time to do any   thing, but see the sights  Please excuse all defects – &   with love to all I am
ever thy loving
daughter Lily

Bridgewater Cottage
8.14. ’05 —

My very dear   friends –
I was very glad to hear again of you,– tho’   sorry to learn of your semi-invalidism,– in which I can   fully sympathise,– but I am overwhelmed – by your generous   check – which was so thoughtful – & so useful! –  I cannot   express myself with sufficient gratitude, & can only say   that it is accepted in the same loving spirit in which it   was sent, & for the inherited friendship of our re-spective parents & grandparents.–
– Did you ever know, or   hear among your family traditions of the strong intimacy   there was between yr. grandfather,– Thomas P. Cope – the   shipping merchant,– & my grandfather – Philip Price the   Superintendent of Westtown School, nearly 100 yrs. ago?–  My   grandfather had a large family of 10 children to educate &   c.– & when his eldest son,– Dr. Wm. Price rec.d his   diploma,– yr. grandfather gave him a double position on one   of his ships going to China,– those of Dr. & also of   supercargo,– & he made 2 trips,– each for 3 yrs,–  It was a   great event in the P. family
I am glad you are having a   pleasant summer in your quiet retreat.–  I am preaching "the   simple life"– more as weknew it in our quiet country homes, or in the simplicity of   Friends.–  I enjoy social life in a quiet way with good   neighbors & a few friends calling in the evenings – but the   constant round of it all day & every day is wearing.
–   What halcyon days we used to have at Woodbourne,– and my   children have no knowledge of it &, only the older ones –   have a bare recollection of dear Cousin Sarah, with none at   all of your lovely Mother.–  What a sunbeam she was!–  I   have some lovely memories to look back upon, but I don’t   seem to acquire in my old age the gentle loveliness of so   many of our old Friends, tho’ I am frequently called upon to   say with a dear old cousin of my Mother’s – Priscilla   Townsend,– (whowas the Mother of the Dentist Elisha K. Townsend who   founded the Philada. Dental College–) "Let me number my   blessings!"–  And another saying of an old Irish neighbor we   had – who had many trials & sorrows – but would end up her   stories with – "but sure, Welcome be the Will of the   Lord!"–
– But I am too reminiscent for young people, &   this letter is terribly egotistic, so I will stop but your   kindness & dear Annette’s letter have brought back many   delightful memories.–  The years are rapidly rolling by, & I   have now entered my eightieth. –
Good bye,– with dear   love to you both & many thanks I remain
your old   friend

Dear Mother and sisters,
I am very glad to find yr. letter to day that you are at least conscious of your deficiencies wh. have been very apparent to me lately.  I did not write at my usual time this week, for I was determined to stand upon my dignity & not write until I hear from you.  The long-looked-for- howver camr this morn. & the mention of M Wilsons name, caused in a measure my forgiveness, as I well know what her name means.  &, Nat I fully sympat with thy sentiment on the disgusting nature of clothing.  I have to stick up in my room here every spare minute [---] tho' I thout I was pretty much ready for spring yetI have to keep up a [----] all the time.  &c.  The prices of things are perfectly tremendous - no decent bonnet ribbon to be got under $1.  +$1.50 pr. yard.  In consequence of wh. I am broke.  Can't you send me a V or an X in next letter?  I find it necessary to get several things [----] she's "cream of Baltimore society."  is so [highly?] dressy that its very troublesome.  [----] The last few days we have had an inpouring of invitations.  No less than three this afternoon.  1st to go out to Susan Matthews' a friend who lives a few miles in the country & who invites us to come out in the [Carr?] to take tea tomorrow 2nd - to another frds' by the name of [Janney?] - 3rd to Cous L. Jeffries.  4th - to Judge Bonds - & 5thly to a [?] of Jesse's [ellegant?] dinner parties.  At least we have reason to think that there is onevery near at hand.  As usual they all come together.  Now if I only had my silk [?] it would come in [?].  but by the time I cld. get it even if I sent it by express the [sprees?] I fear wld. be over.  I had no idea when I [came?] of doing so much wishing.  Jesse has been exceedingly polite taking us riding, ice-creaming &c.  wh. is a part of the cream of society I enjoy our entertainment at home being rather poor sometimes we appreciate outside treats.
Last 7th day afternoon I took a very pleasant excursion with the Kings (Francis his two dhrs. & his two brothers, eligible young bachelors?) out on the rail road 6 or 7 miles where we had a very nice afternoon pic-nic.  They told me abt. Phila.  Mary said she was [?] pleased with them Carrie & with S Walker.  She's a very nice girl in deed.  Galway & M. Cheston called in their carriage & took me to ride & [she?] [?]  totea with them.  wh. I thought was very kind.  I have no tell Cous M that her Aunt thinks she is improving.  Alice Murdock called to see me.  The people here are the greatest callers.  & make the most immense calls.  I ever heard of.  We are often kept in the whole afternoon.  wh. accts. for my having to send you such [?] I meant to have written Cous Mary & to Tom this week but have not the time.  Mother thee need not fear that I shall injure myself with teaching as it does not tire me so much as at first.  I shall [enjoy?] the rest of home.  I believe.  Must stop.

Dear Uncles
Thomas & Joshua Pim   /

I wrote to my Bror. John &c the 17th. of last mo:   aqt.ing them of a great alteration in my ffamily, wch.   letter I supose went in a ship just then ready to sail to   Ireland and now I acquaint you that it hath pleased Divine   Providence to remove my wife from me by Death,  She was   taken Ill of (that Dreadfull distemper) the smallpox about   the 4th. of last moth: & departed in the night between the   14th. & 15th. of ye. same being Sorely afflicted wth. the   distemper, but verry sencible all the time & I hope made   good use of sd. time, often praying & praising God, & tho:   in the time of her health she did not seem as fully as I   cou’d a wisht to Joyn wth. ffrds.  (tho she- went to no   other worship that I know off since we came here but   severall times to ffriends meetings) yet in her Illness she   was desirous of the company of sollid ffrds & severall of   such did visit her & I think are generally in good hopes   that she Dyed in Peace & I believe few who knew her here   were streangers to her former circumstance for my part I did   not endeavour to conceall the truth from Honest ffriends,   and before I pesumed to appoint her buriall I requested   leave of ffriends to Bury her in their ground, which was soe   readily granted that they told me they thought it needless   to ask it, phaps you may desire to know wt. I recd of the   debt due to me I cannot say yt. I recd. none tho: (I thought   more was due,) for Just at last, she desired it might be   forgot or forgiven wch. I think implyed some acknowledgment    I think for above a year past she grew the most sollid &   sober yt. I have known her at all – & I cannot but admire   how much her loss is lamented in this neighbourhood, for she   was a verry oblieging neighbour & skillfull in many   things

I mentioned to my Bror. &c [---] [---] of the   Illness of my youngest Child, we thought it was dying the   next day after its mothers death, yet it continued for   fifteen days longer for the most pt. in great extremity &   then Died, wch. long Illness I believe helped to wean me   from it, soe that its Death did not affect me soe much as I   believe it wd. if it had a died soon, for it was a verry   pleasant Child, it was 7 months old when it fell   sick

I mentioned in a former letter to my Brother the   Death of my servant Jo: Gavin who was the first of my   ffamily who was taken Ill, & Died about a week or 6 days   before the next began my ffamily then consisted of 12 psons   (i:e: before this sickness) whereof 7 was to have it, & of   the 7: 3 is dead, wch. we may conclude was a great stroake,   tho: I may tell you that it does not yet seem soe hard for   me to bear as wt. I formerly bore, but the Death of my poor   wife seemd a greater exercise than I expected it wd. a been,   however I still endeavour to be patient & content wth. what   Providence permits to be my lot in this troublsom   world

I am through [meny] greatly favoured wth.   Health & my five Children are now pitty well tho: my Son   Thos. has had a hard time & a narrow escape with his life   thro: the smallpox

I have been verry well furnisht   with good neighbours during this trouble pticularly Thos.   M.cChuns wife (being a nurse) did not see her own house for   two weeks of the time of my poor Babes Illness,  I have this   comfort that my poor Children seems verry to’rdly, & my Dtr.   Sarah considering her age verry pitty as to her knowledge in   the way of Houskeeping, & on her and my maid Mary Turner.  I   think that pt. must pitty much depend at [pesant]

now   Dear Uncles I shall use some further freedom wth. you, this   Cheange in my ffamily ocasions many thoughts in my mind, one   whereof is to this purpose that since the cause of my   leaving you, my ffriends, & my native Country, is now   remov’d, why shou’d not I return there again, least I shou’d   be taken from my Children & they left more destitute a mong   streangers, but in answer to that, can I think that I should   be brought all the way to this remote pt. of the world for   no other end than to bury my wife, this Country I find more   agreeable to my Health (else it is wth. working harder) this   Country also is governed by more agreeable Laws than that   here are plenty of good ffriends (tho: not my near   Relations) who I believe wd. take care of my Children were I   taken from them, & phaps I may have opptunity to [---] be of   more servis here than there, & thu---] reasoni--] concerning   wch. I desire your sollid Consideration & answer as [---] as   PossibleHowever if you please to Inform me how the woolen trade is   now in Ireland & whether, I am freed from that holding wch.   I was liable to, I am as I mentioned to you before pitty   much Involvd. in Debt & do find it hard to pay Debts wth.   this way of living. corn being low & money scearce, but do   think my self now more at liberty than before to consider of   some other way of making my life Easier, but not by any   alteration soe suddenly as [y.] year

I desire a   pticular account of your [---] familys & my Cousin Wm.   Glaister & of our ffamily in Generall & of ffrds &   neighbours where any alteration has happen’d since my   leaving you,

Soe wth. Dear Love to you all I Conclude   your Loving nephew & affectionate ffriend

Wm   Pim

P:S: the Smallpox continues to spead over this   Country this being the 3d. time of its being here since   settled by the English, it mises but few ffamilyes, & takes   off many heads of familyes especially men in their prime,   here are many widdows now in this County  I am in   expectation of Ja: Nicholson in a little time [p] whom I   expect an act. from Irland & if he dont bring me a servant   or servants I shall be in great want for I am soe now, I   hired. an Indifferant hand lately at Husbandry & it Cost me   36s for 4 weeks (& diat) this has povd. a hard winter &   Spring [fother] is now verry scearce wth. many people but   mine holds out, tho: I lost one cow, yesterday & the night   before here fell a great Snow wch. seems streange to the   people,

Paris 3rd Month 14th 1840
My Dear Cousin
I suppose you   have through the medium of letters to some of our family   heard of us and our safe arrival in Europe, but in   compliance with thy request and my promise which has not   been forgotten, I thought (altho at a late period) a breif   sketch of our [pastimes] in our new location would be   acceptable hoping that you retain a feeling of interest in   our welfare.  We arrived in London after a short and   altogather pleasant voyage passed ten day’s there was   buisily engaged in visiting the many objects very   interesting to strangers, the Tower, Westminster Abbey, St   Paul’s, House of Lords, and various other places, We then   left; after a travel of four days thro an interesting   country we arrived at Paris, during which time we were all   favoured with health, and our children were very good   scarcely uttering a word of complaint of fatigue or any   thing else, this thee may well suppose enhanced our   pleasure, or at least diminished our difficulties, When we   arrived in Paris, we took posession of apartments engaged   for our reception in a French family who speak English,  the   family consists of this and five American families, who form   a pleasant domestic circle, they are all plainly disposed   people, some very interesting a Doctor Lowell with his wife   and daughter who have visited most of the countries of   Europe, Egypt, Palestine, are with us, English is spoken at   our table, this altho very pleasant retards our progress in   the acquisition of the french language,
We are situated   in Rue de Rivoli opposite theTuileries the garden annexed to the palace, the residence of   the royal family, our location is very pleasant, excepting   that we are in the fourth story of the house (this in   America would not be considered respectable) not so in Paris   the population is so great; that highly respectable and even   wealthy families occupy apartments, consisting of several   rooms on a level, so that a house (of course large) will   accommodate many families, a very small proportion of   residents occupying a house as we do in America, this I felt   to be a great abridgment of my domestic comfort
My   ignorance of the language and the uncertainty of our   continuance induces us to board, I do not wish to encumber   myself with domestic cares, for the management of a family   in Paris is attended by much care, for one who would not   choose to leave every thing to the regulation of servants,    There are several hundred Americans in Paris who form a   pleasant society, it is customary here for those who keep   house to set apart one evening in the week for the reception   of their freinds, who receive an invitation to visit them on   that evening whenever inclination dictates, this promotes   great sociability among those who meet, the simplicity of   the entertainment is to be admired, consisting generally of   a cup of tea and cake only, very seldom serving any other   refreshment, in other respects not so simple, as a great   regard is paid to personal appearance, Dress, Dress, seems   to engross their minds to the exclusion of other and better   considerations,
Our two daughters are at a school of high   repute and we think deservedly so, they are improving in   their studies,We have visited several churches, Catholic and protestant    This we feel to be a very great privation, to have no place   of worship to resort to in accordance with our own views   where we could commune with our own hearts and be still, but   we feel the necessity of recurring to the dictates of that   inward guide, which if obey’d will lead out of all error,    We have visited a great many of the places of interest to   strangers, there are many galleries of paintings very fine,   there is at this time an annual exhibition at the Louvre, of   new pieces, some private collections also
I have in my   silent musing’s in immagination revisited most of your   dwellings,  Dear Aunts Ruth and Margery very frequently   present themselves before me, when we left home they both   seemed feeble, I hope their lives may be prolonged to the   comfort of their children by whom they are surrounded, but   it seemed to me [that] the sun of their day was near   [setting] in a tranquil evening, if My Dear Cousin this   excites sufficient interest in thy breast to induce a reply,   information of them as well as many other members of our   family would be grateful to us who are situated so far from   many they still hold dear, please remember us affectionately   to them All,  Richard and Ruth, Caleb and Martha, Samuel   Henry, and thy children from thy attached Cousin

We have just finished   reading in the Montrose papers, which my daughter Annie   Sayne brought down to me this p.m. – the account of the   Dedication of dear Clemmie’s donation to all the people of   old Susq: Co: & under its inspiration I feel that I must   immediately x x x x –––––––––1908 Jan. 4th –

— To prove that my dear friends have   not been entirely forgotten, – I have the audacity to   continue this letter – begun so long ago as almost to be   forgotten unless it be for this purpose! –  An interruption   occurred, during which time Minnie told me that she was   writing or had written to you, & when I asked where she wd.   address it, she said "Oh, in c/o Misses Biddle – they are in   Montrose". —  I demurred, but neither of us knew theGermantown address & altho’ I said "No. 1. Walnut St."   always held a clue – & had for nearly 100 yrs. past, – but   she laughed, – said that date was obsolete, – & now I doubt   if you ever did get her letter! –  I wish I cd. see you, & I   think our tongues wd. travel fast, –  Writing has become   rather irksome to me, – particularly with pen & ink as my   fingers have very much stiffened in my old age – so I   generally write with a pencil(when I think my frds. will not   object,) & I do not write much, except to my two sons, – who   are in R.R.d business at Sydney,– Nova Scotia. —

— We   have had such a hard summer,– partly owing to the delusions   these conceited Virginians had,– that "all the world & his   wife" wd. almost break their necks to get here to see their   wonderful state & its historic surroundings – then their   disappointments & losses were not cheerful or conducive to   cheery letter writing, & I hate to write doleful letters. —If it were not so pathetic,– it wd. be very amusing to see   the downfall of the hopes they all had of making such   enormous fortunes.–  Hundreds & thousands of dollars have   been lost, for the whole thing was a complete fizzle & not   being completed until away into October, & therefore but   little attendance,– those who did come disparaging it, & the   day after the gates were closed, it was put right into the   hands of a receiver!! –  Virginia has not had such a   staggering blow since Appomattox! –

— We have seen   very little ofMiss Walcott altho we attend the same church, but she lives   at the farther side of our town & the trip involves a   trolley ride- a ferry across Hapton Creek & a walk to each   end of the line.-
I am so sorry to hear of Carrie’s   increased deafness, - & descouraged too.- for I have grown   very deaf myself. & when she had all the medical faculty of   Europe to consult, & they did not cure her, - it is not   worth while for me to try. - Is it hereditary with her?- I   don’t remember either of your parents beingafflicted in that way. –  The strongest point in my memory   about them – is your father’s good sound "orthodox" dignity   – always so cheerily smoothed over, by your Mother’s   beautiful almost angelic smile which brightened almost   everybody & everything around them. –  I don’t wonder he   went to bed, when she was taken from him, & could never be   persuaded to rise again. –  I must close this now for my   messenger to take to the post office. –

— How I do   wish you would come to see us.  I hardly know any one who   would be more welcome. –  Now, think it over & see if you   can’t come,– particularly if a cold wave strikes Germantown.   —

Good bye – in which both my girls join, – don’t   ever doubt me, but believe me always your loving &   affectionate friend
Sibylla T. Morris.

Dear Frank
Somewhere in the Month of April, AD      1841

If you are in want of a mystery profound enough      to merit the attention and task the scrutiny of your      powerful mind - endeavor to ascertain if you can what whim      has led me to take this mammoth sheet for my letter instead      of confining myself as heretofore to the narrower limits of      a [Quarto]  It has puzzled me – I thought first of greatness      in the Abstract – how greatness Sympathises with greatness –      How you cant get a Barrel of praties in a Bushel Basket –      and wondered if that was the reason – Some I reasoned Are      born to greatness – some achieve greatness and some have      greatness thrust upon them – and I have come to that      conclusion that struggle against it as I may in spite of all      I may do – greatness is my destiny. ------

“Tantaeni      animis celestibus irae!!” as [Maro] said when the Caelicoli      plagued poor Aeneas half out of his wits. ---  I know      Francis that the provocation was extreme – like unto the      emotions of a female Tiger robbed of her young by some      felonious and ruthless hand – some Yankee Menagerie-Keeper –      who reflects (not the Keeper but the Tiger) that her striped      Darlings will be exposed to the vulgar eye far from their      native land. far from her and from her caresses. – who knows      that in them she has lost perhaps the prop of her declining      years and feels that she is altogether lonely –      

“They will never come she said”
“She said I am      a-weary a-weary”
“Would God that I were dead”!      –

like unto her heart-rending emotions are emotions      of a Poet moaning over the loss the abstraction by      unhallowed hands of his fancy’s creations – his children of      the Brain  She whet her incisors – He mends his pen –      
Her sullen growl resounds thro the forest. = fearful      flies the trembling thief – the invader of their domestic      hearth and social joys. – She sees him in the blue distance      farther than any eye can pierce save the eye of a Mother      bereaved of her offspring --  Guilty wretch! and dont thou      expect such crimes to prosper – Fly as thou may the avenger      is behind – She springs from the tangled Brush – one blow      and her little ones are free and the blood of the ravisher =      washes down his bones – The Poets eye rolls in indignant      fury – He paces up and down – and much Ink must be shed.       Black ink – to expiate his wrongs ------

But Frank I      quote from “L’Entreprise No. 8” “Memory is mortal      forgiveness divine” – There is a difference between the      charity of the Christian and the blind revenge of the beasts      that perish – and I see that thou art well acquainted with      the precept concerning the smiting of one cheek and the      subsequent turning of the other – since – when thou wast      informed of the use I had made of thy Serenade thee sends me      on another piece which I am sorely tempted to appropriate to      the same purpose – viz. “The Thief” an Indignation ode      -----

But “L’Entreprise” is of the things that have      been = its star has set – When it again rises and illumes      our horizon once more – any pieces you may favor me with      will meet with particular attention and speedy insertion –      To Encourage your Modesty I will only hint
at the numerous encores and complimentary remarks which I      appropriated at its reading in our Junto. – I must confess I      had some conscience pangs – at thus robbing you of your due      and ventured to hint that they were entirely mistaken about      the Authorship – But all that was attributed to my modesty      and I could not make them believe it – So any more Serenades      you want inserted or Indignation Odes – either – send them      along and I’ll father ‘em with pleasure ----

As to      that little Biographical sketch in the “Ledger” the idea      pleases me exceedingly – It is not always the fate of Genius      to hear its praises Its requiem is rarely listened to – till      Death has untuned the Ear to praise and “cold obstruction”      chilled the heart and closed the eye – But sometimes Fate      decrees otherwise. -- & To your hands I commit with pleasure      myself and my memory – and to encourage you I think you      would make considerable of a Buzzy – I had thought some time      since I could trace thy classic pen in that respectable      Journal – Sometimes perhaps in the Poet’s corner – and again      I have suspected thy assistance (as Charles Lamb and Dun      Stuart have done before thee - ) [Reparter] “compiler      impromptu” composer and Wellerism manufacturer at a fippenny      bit a head

Dont forget Frank to put in how like twin      puppies we hunted the Muses together – How “hand in hand we      climbed the steep ascent of Parnassus” – and drank from the      same pitcher of the sparkling fountain – and if thee wishes      it I dont know that I shall object to thy inserting that      chaste production of thy blushing and almost virgin Muse –      the ode to Fanny – Though I bethink myself that piece would      better become the columns of the “Little Genius” – for there      was about it an independent air – a noble boldness which      some – nay, many – are too narrowed by the conventional and      affected delicacy of the day fully to appreciate and which      the Little Genius so openly advocates and patronises –      

With this I send you a critique on a Philadelphia      poet one who “blossomed in the desert air” of our unfriendly      climate but who like a wise prophet sought honor elsewhere –      No man is a hero to his valet’s deschambre and Pliny would      never have sucked Parnassian pap to advantage if he had      lived and died a Teacher at Providence School – What a      blight this “Times” man seems to want to throw upon poor      Pliny’s Laurels.  – No mincing matters Regulae cut & slash.       – When I see such an article I always fancy the Burden on my      own shoulders – Just Fancy some of your Serenades served in      the same style – Not kidnapped – eloped with out of pure      affection but barbarously mangled, murdered, its throat cut      from ear to ear.  – Like to a Tiger &c &c (on the other page      - )

New England Yearly Meeting of Friends is held at      New Port from 7th day the 12th of the 6th month to 6th day      the 18th inclusive commencing with the Meeting for      Sufferings – which however thou knowst is only patent to      Cardinals and chief priests of the synagogue First Day is      generally “the Yearly Meeting” par eminence and is usually a      great day at New Port.  Then may be seen straight coats of      the strictest sort – straight coats of a more accommodating      
curve – straight coats which one would hardly know were      straight and it grieves me to mention – some utterly devoid      of straightness – Broad Brims black, drab, or otherwise from      six inches in diameter to a lesser number – or a fraction –      Bonnets which the unsullied snow wreath could not rival in      maiden purity setting off eyes of all colors – noses of all      shapes – and mouths of all degrees of prettiness –      interspersed with some of the adornment of the daughters of      vanity ------ flitting past in crowds – and every now & then      the youth of the company indulging in cachinnations calling      down upon them with speedy rebuke of the more serious &      elderly – while old peaceable looking chassis and wagons      drawn by the most demure looking ponies in the world string      along through the streets and all bound to Yearly-Meeting –      New Port has many other attractions besides Yearly Meeting      however – The ride on the Beach – the Glen the [Fort] and      the Sail in the Harbour take away considerably from the      tedium of the long sittings – and besides Paradise &      Purgatory can be visited – much easier than was done in the      times of Hercules & pious Aeneas – as to the girls I have      often told them that I worship them
“as      stars

Whose purity and distance make them      fair”
and thee must get another pilot when thee comes on      such sounding but I do not despair however and may perhaps      with a few Lessons from thee become “a nice young      man”
All this I put forth expecting you to come & visit      us then – If you will be there – day & month aforesaid – I      will meet you and I think I may promise you a pleasant week      – Harry I suppose put more faith in Fanny [Ell---] than in      any one else – so he will hardly affect a Yearly Meeting of      the spiritually “Exercised –

So no more (and quite      enough) from

Title: 1863 December 11, Awbury, to Cousin Clementine

Awbury Dec. 11th 1863

Here’s a nice stormy 6th day   afternoon at last, My dear Cousin Clementine, in which I can   find a little time to write to thee, I expect thee thinks I   am very naughty indeed not to have found a little time   before, but if I had thee here I could so completly convince   thee in half an hour, that thee would entirely agree with   me, that it is a moral impossibility ever to get any time to   write letters.  We have learned a great many things   Angelica, since last I had the pleasure of conversing with   thee, (I wonder how many months it has been) Yardley as well   as Mary Haines has become ourinstructor, other-wise intelligently he is teaching us to   ride, thee don’t know what fun it is, we have splendid   times,  Yardley & one of his daughters always goes, &   sometimes Tom or Reuben, & Cousin Lillie, Jammy or Casper, &   very rarely Tom Stokes, however I believe Yardly don’t   approve of him as Rachel & he behaved badly the other   afternoon riding too far ahead for Yardley’s notions, so he   came posting over in the evening & held a private   conversation on the piazza with father, to R’s extreme   disgust & indignation.  I suppose thee has heard of our   charities over at the meeting house, we have got up some   contraband meetings for the benefitof the “Young Friends Association” they have a man to cut   out the things, & then they are sent round to the various   meetings to be made up.  We have a branch concern here every   3rd day evening & have a great deal of fun, especialy after   Yardley & his daughters leave, we get tired of our work by   that time, & have a little music “both vocal &   instrumental”.  
But the last & greatest fun, that we   have now, is skatting, Oh! Cousin Clem, I do wish thee would   come over, yesterday afternoon was grand, I haven’t enjoyed   any thing so much for ages, the ice was delightfully smooth,   & my skates elegantly sharp, & they glided over so swiftly,   as to give metwo or three pretty hard tumbles.  Some of the gentlemen   rolled splendidly, the Sun in particular he was one of the   best skaters on the dam.  Compositions are as horrid as   ever, imagin my having to write one last night in addition   to all my other lessons after I got home, with my head full   of every thing else; I missed thy help very much, does thee   remember how thee used to give me ideas, last winter.  O!    Cousin Clem I wish thee would come back again.  We had the   nicest walk last 1st day afternoon that ever was, we went   all round by Harpers & Butlers dams thee knows, a whole   party of us Stokes & Awbury folks in addition toMiss A.C. Smith, I said we had a delightful walk, & so we   had as far as the walk went, but I believe I wasn’t in a   very good mood to enjoy, however I am not going to tell thee   about my mopy fits, I never have them now, ever since I had   that talk with thee at Newport I determined to have nothing   more to do with them; & I was dreadfully provoked at myself   for indulging last first-day afternoon, I beleive a   conversation I had in the morning rather effected my   spirits.  But how foolish I am!  thee’ll think I haven’t   improved a bit if I go on rattling about myself this way.    But CousinClementine thee will have to come over here right-soon, or I   shall begin to think we are never to see thee again.  
I   was very much obliged for thy photograph, though I must say   I can’t flatter thee on it thee way Uncle Harry did, whats   thee think he said about it?  he was looking over my album,   & when he came to it he said to me “thats a fancy piece aint   it”.  I laughed & told him who it was, & he said “it was so   pretty it ought to be put in the stores in Chestnut St.”    wasn’t that complementary now?  But I don’t think it is near   pretty enough to be put in Chestnut St. nor do I think it at   all does thee justice, & I hope thee won’tforget thee has promised me one of those really pretty ones.   But now I geuss thee is beginning to be quite tired of my   nonsense so I will close; hoping thee will answer this very   soon in person

ever thy affec. little Lily

Locust Shade. 5. 27. [18]65

My dear Annie, 

It   seems to me that a very improper time has elapsed since the   receipt of they welcome letter, without my having answered   it - but as we are both well hosted in excuses I will not   add to the list.- Just as I began my letter, thy kind note   was handed me - & I truly thank thee for it and should love   to comply with they request - but [dont] see that it would    be possible. Besides dearie I want thee to come here - and   hope to persuade thee to do so.- Your place must indeed   looklovely & I have thought several times how I should like   to look uponits beauty and enjoy your society - which is always so   pleasant, but I must deny myself this time- I want too, to   hear about the wedding & Clemmy & diverse other things. Our   “Strawberry Company” as thee calls it, is not here- tho we   have had several of our friends the past week, - and shall   probably have more [next]. - - Our cook had gone away for a   fortnights visit, half of the time is gone - at which I   rejoice, and this is another reason why I cannot leave home-   the next week father and mother will be away for a Sundays-   and after that I do hope thee will come to see me. Any day   that suits thee we shall gladly welcome thee. - 

I   heard from Deborah Thomas that Clemmy was pleasantly   situated and like her occupation.- Thee must miss her visits   very much & she thine. - Lily seemsquite absented in her work and is turning out a very      managing young lady - it will probably be of great use to      her in calling out her latent energies.- 

How many      remarkable & [steming]  events have transpired since we were      together.- It seems to me we have, every day, reason to      mourn death of our own dear good President -  Johnson is so      different - & if he should get us into a Mexican war it      would be so sad. But we can but hope for the best. Was it      not wonderful how suddenly & completely the Rebellion cam to      an end. Like the “One hoss slay”- it all broke down at      once.- Poor Jeff makes a sorry figure in his humiliation he      is showing very plainly what a poor miserable specimen  of a      man he was.- Niether true courage or honor in the slightest      appreciative of his great crimes. -- We have justhad our Bettie at home for ten days and busy enough we were   with her spring clothing - she comes back again the last of   next month for vacation.- She is growing so companionable   that I miss her when she is gone very much.-
I am glad to   hear Uncle D B Smith sometimes gets to your house. no doubt   it does him good. Wish I could see him. Will thee give him   my love when thee see him.- Suppose Uncle John & Aunt R   Smith & cos Lizzie are out in the broad Ocean. we hear our   cousin Richard Howland was to go with them, but do not know   if its true. If aunt R’s health is improved - it will be   delightful for them all to be together. Would thee not like   to go if thee could do so properly? - I should exceedingly,   but probably never shall, my life seems destined to be very   unadventurous and matter of fact, - all for the best no   doubt.- Do Lilly & her Philip’slive in Germantown? What a favored place you live in all the  nice people do mostly congregate there. R wishes to be  remembered to thee & hopes sometime to accept the very kind  invitation. Just now I [----] [------] are all engrossing. -  I hope thy father is pretty well this spring please remember  me to him.- With much love I am very truly thee thee  at[----] 
S. S. Reeve

I hope thee has not got any  of those little salt sellars yet, as I have has a pair  waiting for thee ever so long, Will send them down next week  if I can. -

Baltimore 5. 10th. 65

Dear Tom,
Thee must excuse   me for having been so long answering thy letter, & not think   that I did not care about it, for I was right pleased that   thee wrote to me, & I have said to myself ever so many times   [said] that I must write to that “Little “Toms”—  but thee   sees now I have got to be a school mistress, I have so many   cares that I cant always do[o] what I’d like & then I have   had a good many letters to write to different people &   knowing that thee saw the home ones & knew all about me, I   took it the easier.
I have now been “school”mom=’en” long   enough to get a prety good idea of the business – & my idea   of it is, thatits a good deal easier to be a scholar than I teacher, – so   thee can remember that for thy comfort when thee has a hard   lesson to learn.  To teach a school of troublesome boys I   shd. say was one of the hardest businesses’s that cld. well   be got up..  The girls are bad enough, but when it comes to   boys – – they’re the [---] of man.  I have in my school   about 35 boys & a dozen girls between the ages of 6 & 15 —   The girls I have but little trouble with, but the little   boys are regular monkeys.  No sooner is my back turned than   they begin their discussions of wh. they have a variety —    Its the hardest thing in the world to keep them still, & if   they get a good chance there’s not one of them that is too   good to get up & takea dance or a fight or any other such little amusement that   they think will set the school in an uproar.+  [+ Throwing   spit balls is a very bad habit they have – also dancing “Ham   fat”]  My punishments are various.  Sometimes I shake the   culprit & if that wont do, tie em up hand & foot & put em in   the corner — wh. is a very troublesome operation to me.  But   it seems as if nothing wld. beat it into their heads that   school is any thing but a place to play in.  
Most of   them can read a little some not at all, & like “Busy” – they   must always spell girl gril and dirt – drit –.  It seems as   if it came natural —  One of their best accomplishments is   singing wh. we sometimes let them do in school.  My children   know “my”native country thee” & the colored “Wolunteer”— wh.   they shout out with great effect. But I guess I’ve told thee   enough about the darkies  We’ll talk a little abt.the whites.  How comes on work at Haverford?  By the way thy   hand writing is coming on so well, that when I got thy   letter I thot. it was Busy’s himself, it was so good.    Have’nt you a boy named Allen Thomas,?  I expect he’s a nice   fellow & has two very nice brothers whom I met last eveng.    There are [---] pleasant frieds here & I do not often have a   chance to feel lonely or home sick.  How does Prof. Cope &   his botany lectures?  I am going to try to write him a note   to send in this & consequently must say farewell or shall   not have time.  Thee can take this down home with thee next   7th day & tell ‘em it’s all they’ll get this week.— as they   dont deserve any for some time.  Give my love to all, & if   thee gets time write again to thy affec sister C

Springfield. Mass. Aug. 31st
4th day eve.

Dear   Papa & Mama,
We rec’d your letters this morning just as   we started & were very glad to get them, tho’ sorry to think   they came too late to engage rooms for you at the Cliff   House we were very anxious to hear from you in time, but you   were so long making up your minds, that we almost came to   the conclusion you were not going to at all, & had given it   up.  However Uncle H. thinks there will be no trouble in   getting them by writing afterwards.  We left Newport at 7   o’clock this morning & dined at Worcester very comfortably   about 2 o’clock & arrived here at 6 1/2 about.  Thishotel is delightful, they say it is one of the best in the   Union Sallie Parish says “its where all the brides come to,”   I haven’t seen any yet!  We got a splendid supper & Uncle   Harry & Chell & I took a little stroll through the town  it   seems very pretty as far as gas and star-light would show.    But me thinks we will not see much more of it, we propose   leaving quite early tomorrow morning for [Mt.] Holyoke.    Aunt Mary says “that all things considered she is certainly   remarkably well,” last 1st day she says she felt better than   she has for a year.  She is certainly improved, but don’t   raise your hopes to high or I fear you will be disappointed   – She’s better, but not well.  
They are talking,   talking! all the time, & I can’t write, Aunt [K]. has a very   nice room on the secondfloor, & Chell, Ginnie, & I have three cots put up in an   adjoining private parlor, its quite fine we’re all seated   round the centre table with a bright gas-light above us & a   velvate carpet beneath us, & the most delightful easy chairs   aren’t we splendid?  
Uncle H. says our present intention   is to come home in the 2 o’cl train 7th day (if the   time-table is right) I think we’ll not get out [--] 4, if we   change our plans we’ll telegraph.  Now Mother I must stop   for I want to fix my hat & its getting late.  Aunt M. says   she would have written but she has been retrimming Anna’s   hat & had no time.  Love to all
very   affec’ly
Lillie

P.S.  Resolved-that we take dinner   at Aunt [Annas], & come in quarter before 4P.S.  resolved that you need not expect us till we   come
P.S.  thats wrong!
P.S.  We will probably come   out in the 9 o’clock cars taking tea at the   Continental.
P.S.  Still talking can’t tell if this be   the final decision!
P.S.  Final decision! Seriously!  It   is extremely difficult to fix our plans, & we will   positively come home on 7th day either 1/4 4 or 9 o’cl   trains.
P.S.  Uncle Harry thinks we ought to give a   reason for our indecision.  Reason That we can not find   beforehand how long it will take to visit Mt. Holyoke as we   have to drive part of the way, & that makes it uncertain   whether we will reach New Haven tomorrow night or the next   day

My dear   Anne,

From cloud land do I now address thee it has   been raining, raining for days – but we cannot wish it   otherwise as it will raise the mountain springs which were   beginning to fail rapidly it has been rather an anxious care   with us to watch the springs for fear they would give out   before the cisterns were prepared to save the water and the   steam pumps were fixed so that the pure water might be   available for the sick in the Hospitals there are but about   500 patients now but it is hoped that the large field   Hospital at Chattanooga may soon be moved up here and   probably two thirds of the patients that would otherwise die   might recover I think there had been but four deaths since   the Hospital was established here  The air is so fine and   the water runningthrough sand stone rocks the sweetest that could be and I   sometimes think the patients would recover without medicine   –  Several patients extremely ill with pneumonia have lived   although Dr H said they must die –
When it does clear I   expect we shall have one of these magnificent cloud scenes –   Sunshine and blue sky above whilst below us a billowy sea of   clouds looking as if they were frozen as they formed –  I   imagine it must look precisely like an Artic sea –  We have   witnessed two such scenes when it had been raining heavily –   the whole valley completely hid except about half way up the   Mountain –  Anna Harlow is describing some of the cloud   scenes we have had beautifully alluded to the psalm where   they are so grandly described and which we can appreciate   from having witnessed the clouds in their grandeurabove and below us as well as like the present time we have   been for days enveloped in the thick clouds –  "The waters   stood above the mountains At Thy rebuke they fled – at the   voice of thy thunder they hasted away –  They go up by the   Mountains they go down by the valleys unto the place which   thou hast founded for them –  He watereth the hills from his   chambers" &c–  There are many beautiful scenes so much so   that I could not picture them to thee –  I know thee would   enjoy many of the views that are on every hand, not only   from their beauty but from the historic interest that even   now induces people by hundreds to come up the Mountain to   see the celebrated "Lookout" and the scenes in the valley   below us –  I never was at a more charming place I think –    The other day some ladies from Philada. Ellen Parrish sister   to Robert A Parrish and Dr Janney’s daughter spent two days   at our house (and rather inconveniently,two nights as we were obliged to give up our room and our   husbands had to sleep on the floor –  they had come on a   mission of relief to E Tennessee refugees and had become   acquainted with the Commander of the post Col Culver who   offerred them facilities to go to the Lake and Falls about   six miles distant –  Lewis & myself accompanied the party –    It was a scene of rare beauty –  The Falls are not large but   very high and fall in shimmering spray down the most   beautiful rocks –  It seemed to me as though every thing had   been brought to bear to make the place charming  The rocks   of various hues and shaded seemed cut into the most   picturesque forms whilst the clear mountain stream came over   its clean and clear rocky bed & went down the precipice to   the height of 125 feet –  Another face below us which we   could discover by the Mist we did not get to visit –The slopes were covered with Rhodedendron of very large   flower and Laurels and the [Fringe] tree growing wild –  We   came away reluctantly and all of us thought I have no doubt   that we either would visit it again or would more than ever   desire to do so –  The next day being First day our   neighbours Dr Ridgleys who had been up but a few days   started to go there on horseback there were six of them one   of the party told me that she went feeling rather afraid   that it was not right – they had got quite a distance beyond   the pickets and they must have been very near the Falls I   judge when as they were a little off the roadside resting   off their horses they saw a man dressed in Rebel uniform,   grey cloth and brass buttons passed right by them [leading]   his horse and did not take notice of them – one of the   gentlemen called after him after he passed – "My kind sir   where do you belong?" he repliedat General Thomas’ Headquarters.  They all believed him to   be a rebel officer and as he had a large revolver and they   were unarmed he could have captured the whole of them – they   were pretty much frightened and concluded to turn their   horses heads homeward and did not see the Falls – so much   for their pleasure party on First day –  In speaking of it   it was remarked that sometimes our scouts go dressed in   Rebel uniform – it might have been one of them –  There is   another very beautiful place called "Rock City"–  The brow   of this Mountain is crowned with soft kind of Rocks which   look as if some day had been washed and rounded by water   covering them –  Geologists would say they had –  At Rock   City these rocks cover the ground, at one place like a town   and at another we walked over them and gathered the most   beautifullichens and mosses x_, red green & drab, [x  with most   remarkable fissures & clefts all through them] I only wish   we could send you some specimens –  I think we might by   "Adams Express" sometime before we go away when the   facilities [of] transportation are more available than they   are here at present there have been some moms gathered and   sent to the different Fairs for the benefit of the Sanitary   Com. as well as lots of Canes–  The roots of the Laurel are   very hard and beautifully grained large quantities are dug   and articles made of them as mementoes of the place –  Our   Ben has quite a lot which the soldiers gave him when they   went to the Front – which he sells as well as canes to   increase his fortune –
Thee may be very sure that I was   much gratified upon receiving thy kind little note –  I had   not forgotten my promise to write to thee but supposing thee   often heard from us through my Children I did not know   whetherthee cared particularly about my writing added to which I   rather feel averse to tell the same thing over again –   although there is not any lack of incident here –  We have   been living very quietly here the past three months –  We   have had some acquisitions to the place lately but need not   feel alarmed at their being very extensive, without people   build for themselves or live in tents –  As I raise my eyes   I see the tents of Major Mc’Michael and one or two others in   the woods at one side of us – they look very pretty – he is   Adjat to Gen Thomas – is the son of Morton McMichael of   Philada. on the other side is the cottage of Dr Ridgley   Medical Purveyor with two ladies boarding with them and Capt   Edwards from Penn Wife & daughter who board with one of the   old residents are all the Society here except ourselves A   part of an Engineer Brigade about600 men the Officers Hospital of 100 men and convalescents   of the number of 400 are all that live here except three or   four families who have remained through all and are entirely   dependent for provision for what they can purchase through   exchange –  They sell their milk at from 50 cts to $1.00 per   gal eggs 75 cts per doz butter 75 cts per lb and have been   getting in exchange from us flour at 3 1/2 cts per lb sugar   14 cts per lb –  They charge for butter milk 75 & 80 cts per   gal and can get it readily as it is so desirable for the   sick –
I have often recurred to the time I spent at your   house last Spring when I was with you in sympathy by the   Suffering bed of thy dear Mother –  I never witnessed such   suffering and I never recur to it perhaps but with Something   of the tender feelingsthat then pervaded my heart –  I dare say thee often feels   lonely without her dear Anne – but no doubt thee thinks that   thy loss is her gain and that she would not wish to exchange   her bliss in Heaven for any earthly thing – there was a   great deal that was pleasant and sweet that she left below –   Many that have the tastes to enjoy the beautiful could not   have them gratified like the inmates of such a home as you   have but with it all I often felt sorrowful that dear sister   was deprived of the use of her eyes which to me would have   been terrible – but all things have been ordered aright we   cannot doubt –  I would be very glad to hear from thee as   often as thee feels like writing to thy absent but not the   less interested and affectionate 
Aunt Martha –
Please   give my love to Father and all the inmates of your home –

Bristol July 13. 1771 – 7th day 1 oClock
My dear   Sister

My Henry came here last evening in seeming   good spirits but indifferent Health; he eat a very light   supper, and sett off this morning (after a poor breakfast)   about 8 oClock.  He has a fine day, and I hope riding and   relaxation from business will restore him; he talked of   returning to Bristol on 5th day or perhaps not untill 7th   day next.  Thy continued Confinement and constant care give   me many an anxious minute; but I trust the time will come   when it may please kind Providence to make things easier to   thee.  I was not quite so well yesterday as usual & my dear   Henrys coming to me so unwell gave me pain.  I am quite   bravely to day after coming out of the water but full of   thought about my dear little crowing Henry.  Doct. D.*   [*Denormandie] came here last evening, and, after the usual   salutation, said to me, he was come to have some serious   talk with me; I smiled; nay said he I am in earnest; about   what Doctor? – weaning your little son; such a hearty   growing boy, who seems to live upon you, is enough to draw a   pain in a weakly person, where there had never been one   before; besides he keeps you waking at nights, and prevents   your using means that might restore you; if it was not on   his account you might now go with Mr. Drinker to the sea   shore, and so forth.  There are several women here who I   beleive have put it into the Doctors head that I ought not   to suckle the Child.  My Henry seconded him, and said he   would write this morning to thee, but as he was poorly, I   undertook to do it.–  Do not think my dear, from what I have   written, that I am worse; Indeed I am not through mercy, but   have had the pain in my breast oftener than I had sometime   ago, which I told the Doctor.  I beleive that if I had a   Girl with me that was worth a fig, it would be different,   for the one I have has no knack of making the Child fond of   her.  Doctr. D. says as Doctr. Evans knows my Constitution,   he would have him spoken to. –  I would have thee see the   Doctor and talk with him.  Patty would do a great deal   better than the Girl I have, and should she offer again, I   would not have thee entirely discourage her, but tell her   thee beleives the girl I have does not suit me, and if she   thinks she can behave so as to please me, thee would have   her call again.  It will be time enough (after theehas spoken to Doct. Evans) to come to any conclusion when my   Henry returns.  I had a room full of visitors yesterday   afternoon; two Chariotts full besides others; T. Ringold &   Wife from Maryland; Sally Hoffman, Sukey Pintard, her sister   Boudinott from New York; Serlis’ wife, Betsy Tilghman from   Philada. and Billy Coxe’s daughter, and Sally Tredwell the   Doctors sister.  We all went in the evening to Bath.  I go   but little a visiting, and they all think that my little   dear keeps me at home, and every ones cry is wean him, wean   him; thee would be charmed to see the dear little fellow,   how he daily improves in cunning antick tricks.  I long to   see thee and my dear Children, but dont know how to bring it   about.  My Henry was saying that he was well pleased that I   did not get his letter by Billy Hodge (as he had mentioned   thy being unwell) as thee is now better. – I would have thee   my dear take half a spoonful of the Elixir every day to   strengthen thee.  I have not had occasion to take any since   I came up as yet, but thee knows it was of great use to me   taken in small quantity.  I have been but a little while   writing thus far, but as I have not stopped since I began, I   grow tired, and my dear little one is crying for me; My dear   love is to thee & to my sweet Children, to whom I intend to   write when I can conveniently; they must not be impatient,   but good and kind to each other, & very dutiful & mindful of   their Aunty’s will, which will give great pleasure to their   very affectionate mammy
I am, my dear Sister, thine &c   –
E. Drinker

My dear, dear, kind Henry looked so   unwell as he slept this morning as made my heart ache; he   was last night more than commonly chearful, which I have   observed often to be the case when he is unwell.  how unlike   the generality of Mankind is he in his natural disposition   many ways.  he was last night at supper affectionately   acknowledging thy tender care of him, & saying how clever it   was to have two Wives.  We were likewise wishing that it was   convenient to thee to spend one month here, free from care   of us & ours. –  I hope it may please God to spare me and   restore me to health for my Henrys sake, & that I may be   enabled to make up in some measure to my dear Husband and   Sister their many, many kindnesses to me; but shouldshould it happen otherwise, may I be enabled to say, the   Lords will be done. –

5 oClock – Billy Parr has been   here; he says he saw thee, & that you are all well.  he has   gone to Trenton, where Peggy, Nancy and Caleb are to go   tomorrow; they want me to go, but I shall not.  Molly Foulke   is expected here this evening or in the morning.  Mag.   Divine next second day, so that we shall have the house   full.  Peggy gives her love to thee.  Henry’s asleep, & I am   going to Bath.  farewell my dear Sister for the   present.
E.D.
I wrote yesterday by S. Le Gay, which   letter I suppose thee has received.  I make no doubt but my   dear Henry will return bravely.  tomorrow will be a lonesome   day to me.  my love to neighbour James –

Aug 16.   1876.

My dear Friend,
This morning Agnes received   from thee a very kind & welcome letter which she wishes me   to answer at once, as we are both most anxious not to miss   the visit from you which we have been looking forward to   with so much pleasure.  And please do not leave England   without first spending a few quiet days with us, here.Agnes was strong enough to leave her bed for the first time   yesterday: she is up again today & as each day adds to her   strength, she will soon, we expect, be going about as usual.   We want you, therefore, if possible, to come to us from   North Wales (there is a good service of trains [---] Crewe)   next Friday week, if possible, the 25th inst. & stay over   Sunday, at least.  If you can do this (& please try!) my   Sister Hannah will, I hope, either come with you fromCrewe, or join you here.  She will relieve you of all very   active duties & so take away, we hope, all your most   considerable objections to coming to Mayfield just now.  If   you will only send me word where you will come from, I will   forward a list of our local trains at once. –
Please feel   fully assured that we wd. not press you to do this if we   felt there was any risk to Agnes.  It will be a real treat   to us to have you with us just as long as you can stay, and   a grievousdisappointment if we miss you. –
Since hearing from thee   last, we have often talked of you, & only two days ago. we   were rejoicing that you would now be able to come to us, as   the little stranger had arrived, & was doing well.  I hope   you have good tidings from home; we are enjoying this   delightful weather at our new house exceedingly.  In about   three weeks we hope to welcome James & Mary Taylor, who   winter here.  Caroline Shipley is still with us, much to our   pleasure.  With our warm love to Alexis & thyself, I   am,
Thine very sincerely,
J. Simpson.

Baltimore 5.21

Dear Mother & sisters,

Its   quite long since I have written to you & I expect you think   it strange I have not acknowledged the rect of the [---] by   express wh. arrived safely & timely.  I have not written   because I have been in such a whirl all the week that I   really have not been able to get a needful amt of sleep I   knew too that you wd. be occupied with the wedding, & wld.   not miss my letter.  I suppose the nuptials are over & I   hope passed off satisfactorily — I shall expect a full acct.   shortly.  The same eve that you were enjoying the wedding   festivities at [--------]I also was immersed in scenes of revelry & mirth — much   gayer tho perhaps not more enjoyable than those.  It was the   eve of Jessies grand party, -- wh. was the longest & gayest   I ever attended.  It was like a concentration of weddings   for all looked like brides & there were 80 or 90, — The   supper wh took place at 12 o’ck P.M. was magnificent.  The   meats & the fried crabs & the, sweet-breads--& the elegant   Baltimore confectionery & the ices & the fruits & the   flowers exceeded, as did also the ladies dresses—There were   two or three brides—J Hoag was one, but they were mostly   very gay fashionable people, & I felt some what out of   place--& I am very glad there are not likely to be any more   such entertainments, as I had to teach sch. thro. a sick   head-achenext morn wh. did not pay—I was very glad the skirt arrived   in time, & also that I had taken the precaution to have the   white body made I thot I looked quite nice, considering—at   least I shd. have thot so in Phila but theres no beating   these ‘Baltimo’--Belles--  I was presented by a gentleman   whose name begins with -- [J?] with a very beautiful bouquet   as were many other young ladies  This is the first evening I   have spent at home for a week & I expected to have spent it   in writing but a visitor came in—a young man named   [Joliff?]—he ask us to go to the top of the monument wh. we   have not yet got to, another youth has invited us to go this   week on an expedition to a placed called Federal Hill—so you   see we are quite belles.

The celebrated Emma Congdenfrm. Providence is here now.  She occasions a good many   little tea parties & I have met her several times.  She is   very lovely indeed.  Her father Gilbert C, visited me in my   sch. room the other day & was very cordial saying he   remembered being at our home in Susquea some years   ago.

I believe I have not written to you since the   young Englishman was here, he brot me a letter of   introduction frm. A. Harrison & I had the pleasure of taking   one or two walks & teas with him.  He made himself so   pleasant & agreeable that every body was quite charmed with   him.  He only stayed a few days but expected to be here   again.

Please tell [Amy?] & [Elg.?] dont forget that   Jesse wished me to let them know he had heard of a very good   safe & higly recommended hackney somewhere in these parts   wh. can be purchased for 200 dollars

Thanks for the   generous donation of stamps.  I think it will last me.Please tell them & tell Aunt Caroline that I was very much   obliged for her nice letter wh. I shd. like to reply to when   I can get time.  I lent it & the sermon to M. Cheston, who   seemed grateful.  I will endeavor to return the letter   safely. much love to them all.  I wrote to Tom a letter a   week or two ago wh. I suppose he got.

April 22nd 1907

Dear Cousin Nettie,

I am very   much ashamed of receiving your postal this morning, that I   had not acknowledged the receipt of your package of pastals.   We enjoyed looking at them, and I locked them up with your   others.  My only excuse is that I have been kept very busy   lately.  For two months or more we have not had a girl, the   one we had had since the fall, left without any notice   saying she was sick, a good general house-work girl is very   hard to get, and I dislike changing very much, and I   proposed
that we should do without one till we went to Pocono, as the   old woman we have had there three years wants to go again.    We have to hire two or three times a week, which does not   make our wages much less, but it is a saving in other ways.    Of course it gives me more to do and keeps me more at home,   but on the whole have gotten along very nicely.  For the   last ten days we have been enjoying a visit from Beckie and   Margaret, they think they must go back in a few days.    Mother just now is pretty well, but she has suffered this   winter a great deal from rheumatism, is not quite free from   it yet; it has been a hard winter for that.  We had had acold spring, to-day is warmer, and should not wonder if we   jumped right into Summer, but hope not as Mother feels the   heat very much, and although we would like to go to Pocono   in May, we do not want to go till Dick, Mitchell's son, who   boards with us, is thrugh college, which will be early in   June.  Cousin Mary Smith is going to board with us all   Summer, which we are very glad of.  Charlie has been invited   to preach at Pocono June 23rd so hope we will be there   before that, so to have a little visit from him; he was not   able to get up last Summer.  There was a woods fire up there   about two weeks ago, and a cottage quitenear us was burned.  We were so thankful that ours escaped,   for we would have been lost if it had gone.  Augusta Hazard   was in Philadelphia a few weeks ago, she asked if we had   heard from you lately.  I must apologize for the blots I   have just made, as I have not time to re-write it.  With   much love to you both from Mother, Beckie and my-self.    Mother wants to write to you, but she does not write as much   as she used to.  Affectionately your cousin

Laurel House July 19th

My  dear Mama,
Rachel has   spent herself so in writing to thee that it seemed hardly   worth while for me to try, so I thought I wld. wait till her   fever was over, & as this eve. she seemed little inclined to   desert the piazza, I concluded to undertake the task.  We   have had a most exercising day in all senses of the word,   but so wonderful is the effect of this mountain air that I   do not feel the least tired.  In the first place this   morning we set off in an open wagon for Haines’ fall a   pleasant ride of about 2 miles, but it was after we got   there the “tug of war” began –  We hada regular scramble, part of the way was so rough that Tom &   Walter concluded to remain behind & before we got through   there was no one left but Harry Ellie & Madge & I, we went   down to the very foot of the lower falls, & were well   repaid; it was a most beautiful spot, a succession of six   lovely little falls ending in cascades & rapids, it was   altogether quite charming, the prettiest place of the kind I   ever saw, & I don’t remember ever to have seen a photograph   of it –  We did not get home till after the dinner bell had   rung, so were obliged just to give a little smoothe to our   hair, & go in in our mountain dresses, but every thing is   very primitive here, & nobody pretends to dress for dinner.    As we were all preparedwe concluded instead of changing our dresses to go after   dinner down the stream about a mile to Bastion falls under   Tom’s piloting, & soon comes in the adventure – we just got   to the head of the fall, & were [nerving] ourselves for a   scramble to the foot, when some one remarked that it was   raining, & sure enough it was, we took shelter under some   trees and concluded it wld. soon be over, & we would wait,   but it got harder & harder, & at last found its way through   the branches, & came down on us in large drops, which were   decidedly wetting, we tried it for a little while, but   finding there was no sign of stopping & we were getting very   wet we concluded to push on home, –  At first it seemed to   have slaked alittle, but it soon began harder than ever, & we went   tearing along jumping over rocks & through bushes till we at   last arrived at the foot of the Kauterskill, & then there   were all those dreadful stairs to go up – however we pushed   on, & at last arrived panting at the house – we were pretty   objects to be sure all wet, & draggled, & hot – there were   several gentlemen sitting round on the piazza, & I thought   it a remarkable instance of politeness that they did not   ever smile, I’m sure I could not have resisted it.  Of   course we retired immediately to our appartments, & changed   every thing making ourselves most comportable & desidedly   more presentable.  Thee need not feel the least concern for   I don’t think we are any of us a bitthe worse, & the most remarkable part is we are not tired.    The only thing that suffered was our hats, but I guess they   will look pretty well when they dry, & we’ll have to retrim   them at Newport –  Thee must be sure & not forget my bonnet   so that if we should arrive 7th day night I may have   something to wear to meeting.  Also mother I think I forgot   to put on the list a thin white body of mine & my best   underbody that I wanted to have done up & brought in the   trunk – Virginia will know.  Tom wrote to Father yesterday   to go by 7th days steamer, & one of us will try to write by   the next.  We are having a most delightful time, & as thee   willsee by my account I am as well as possible, so thee need not   have any anxiety on my account.  I do hope you are getting   along nicely, & don’t feel very lonely, I know thee must   miss Father very much, but I hope he will be a great deal   better for his voyage & come home to us quite strong, & free   from all those miserable head-aches.  
Aunt L & Chell   send love, & the former says she is intending to write to   thee very soon.  
Give a great deal of love to all, &   Virginia especially I want to write to her, she was so very   kind in helping me to get ready to come away, I don’t know   what I should have done without her.  
Good-night dear   Mama,
thy ever loving
Lily
Please remember to bring   the Banner Essays to Newport.

Iowa Falls 4 mo 27. 1856
My Dear Cousin Annie

A   great flood has washed away mills and houses along the Iowa   River carrying every thing before it but what a puny flood   it was compaired to the flood of tears I shed on hearing of   the marriage of Susan (how my hand trembles as I write the   name) thy letter of consolation came as a balm to my wounded   heart and I will try and take thy advice not to cry after   spilled milk.
Affairs are going on in the old way in this   section of the globe nothing of much interest is stirring   except the wind which to day is particularly severe I never   had an idea that the wind blew, as it does across the   praries it realy exceeds the blowing at "Our old House at   Home" otherwise called "Bleak House."
Thy letter of   information was replete with accounts of marriages and I can   do no better than return the complement by telling thee of   an intended one between Benjamin K Wetherell & Miriam   Thompkins both of them are young and friends they will be   married in about 4 weeksat our meeting house (ie the residence of Benj Talbott.) it   will no doubt be conducted in a novel style.  I am not at   present able to give any information respecting bridesmaids   but will at a future time give a complicated description of   dress and cerimony.  The groom, or intended groom rather is   from Chester, Pa I was at Westtown B School, with him.  His   is the only face I have ever seen before, since I came into   Iowa.
Thee would smile to see the inconsistency in dress   of the females of the society in this part of the country I   observed one in meeting this morning who wore a plain bonnet   and shawl a red calico dress made surplus, and to crown all   a cheap plated silver breastpin not small in sise with a   large red stone, or glass rather set in it,!!!  I had to   smile.  An other peculiarity in meeting is the presence of   numerous "babies" and small children who enliven the meeting   with their sonorous (?) music.  I might enlarge much on the   peculiarities of the west but time and space will not permit   But one expression I will tell thee when tellinga story to any fair dame.  if it proves to be rather a   remarkable one she replyes "I want to know"! with an   emphasis on the word to also repeating it with a slight   nasal twang.
One word about western life in some of its   stages a few weeks ago having occasion to go about 20 miles   north of this place into the "wilds of Iowa" I had to stop   all night at the house of a "Hoosier" his cabin was about 18   by 16 without a window 7 small children stood around the   fire with their mouths and eyes open as I entered the room   was also without a floor unless a hard surface of earth   might be called a floor in one corner stood a bedstead a   calf was tied in an other corner whilst a "pig" had the   entire range of the house.  in such quarters I was compelled   to eat and lodge for one night, and only one thank fortune,   as there was no other house within 8 or 9 miles.  After   "tea" (what’s in a name?) I amused myself with looking into   the fire and listening.  to the oldest daughter (aged about   16) who stood by the fireplace chewing her bonnet string whorelaited the hair breadth escapes the pig had from being   hooked by the "old brindle cow" and how Jonny (the next to   youngest) got lost in the "bresh" when looking after the   cows.  a bed was at last made on the floor for my companion   and myself where we soon forgot all the world and the rest   of mankind in sleep.
But this is not all Iowa I am as   comfortably fixed as can be expected.
While I write some   inteligence just comes which has cast a gloom over the whole   town it is the inteligence that a steam mill which was   intended to be erected in place of the water mill removed by   the water during the freshet, will not be erected excuse   more at present, the town will be evacuated by a great part   of the inhabitants their indignation is so great.  I dont   know what my next move will be

B 6/7—65—

Dear Mother & sister Annte.

I think   I’ll address you collectively this time, as I suppose   Caroline’s head’ll be turned with weddings & unable to   appreciate common topics. I recd. yr. very interesting &   spirited epistles this morn.g & reply at once, in order that   you may not have cause to complain of remissness this time,   & upon what ground you did it last, I must say I cld. not   discover, as I think I have been up to the mark quite as   much as you have. Thy remarks [a] on properness &c were   quite edifying. I expect thee wd. be charmed with the   Baltimore people. They are certainly most social & charming   in their manners, tho’ I dont believe afterall, when you come to the foundation of things that there is   any more good substantial material among them than among   some of that despised class denominated "the proper." As to   the gentlemen I cant say that I have met any whom I consider   very deeply interesting As far as gallantry & politeness go   they are certainly very attractive Bt if we cld. only   introduce a little more of these elements with some of our   [imperturbables] I incline to think these wld. be found   quite as deep in the long run. I must say it is refreshing   to get hold of some thing that is more [impressible] than a   stone & I intend to [---] up Baltimore ways loudly when I   get home. Tell Cousin Mary she must hurry & come down as   fast as she can, or I fearI shall not get to have my sprees with her. This morn the   new teacher who is going to take my sch. arrived & I was   promoted or depressed I dont know wh. to the rank of   assistant to Mr Waterman, the principal of the sch. It is a   splendid change for me, as his room is much pleasanter & I   have none of the discipline to do but only the hearing of   the lessons—intellectually, it seems a most magnificent   advance frm. a-b only to geography and arithmetic & I shd.   be quite willing to teach there for weeks if it was’nt for   the hot weather, as it is, however, considering the [--] &c   I think I had better not stay much after the three months   are up wh. will be abt. the mid of June--& very soon—as you   will perceive, so you may make preparations for me, soon   after that time—I hope you’ll havepleasant little surprise prepared for me in the way of a   closet—wh. wont be the linen closet—I have to keep up such   an everlasting foolding and unfolding here that I shall be   perfectly delighted to get a place to "hang up" in.

I   expect I am indebted to my frd. Jesse for this release frm.   the infants—I said to him in joke some time ago that I thot,   I shd. give "notice" soon for them to get another teacher &   he took it in earnest but I am very glad, on some accts, as   I shd like to get some ideas about older teaching frm Mr.   W.

I expect you’ll enjoy [Mr. N’s] wedding most as   much as Lilly’s—There was a young gentleman here the other   day who told somebody that he thot L’s wedding was   dreadfully stupid, & that he thot’ one or two of the   bridesmaids (he did’nt say all) were the ugliest girls he   had ever seen—not a very complimentary speech I think.
As I shall probably come home so soon it will not be worth   while to send the things by express—tho’ if I cld only have   had them now they wld. have been exceedingly useful -- I   think maybe I’ll try & get myself a beige skt. here & we   shall not be likely to have many more tea parties now the   warm weather has come -- We’ve never heard any more abt.   Jessies strawberry party & we’re afraid he’s forgotten it.   He took us to a small one out at his bro. James’ night   before last. We went in a buggy & pair & came home by   moonlight—quite romantically -- The buggy is only used on   very romantic occasions, I believe. Its so nice here   moonlight nights—the ladies all dress up in their whites &   sit out on the front door steps, & go round [seeing?] one   another with beaux or beau less just as it happens.Has Fanny Drinker gone home? I reckon she has & where is   Cous. Sarah? Give my love to her if she is about still. I   ought to have written to her. Give my love also to all the   Wynndowners also please give my love & congratulations to   all the bride cousins & tell them I’m very sorry not to be   giving them anything-- Maybe if I aint so lazy I’ll make em   something after I get home. But dont tell em that. I believe   this is all I have to say at present—will write and fix the   day of course before I come. If Cous. M. comes soon please   send the shawl and the [b----] skt. as I [---] much love to   all—yrs. affec

ClemmyI shd. be pleased to have some [---] my return & also before   my return

Will thee dear Clemmie accept this   little book as a token that I appreciated thy patient   endeavors to gratify my request; & also as a companion of   thy sorrowful thoughts, who would fain, with the blessing of   God, lead thee to peaceful meditations.--
Especially note   the introduction. Thee will find some passages marked; these   struck me as applicable to thy feelings--But do not feel   compelled to read
because I give; rather seek its counsels, as thee is drawn   by a sense of need; and perhaps thee may find a fountain of   joy which thee has never know yet. But it will only be as a   guide to the everlasting spring of peace which is in Jesus   our Saviour.
I opened my Bible to find a promise for thee   & this was the verse which met my eye. Isa xxxv 4 "Say to   them that are of a fearful heart, be strong, fear not:   behold your God will come with vengeance, even God 
with a recompense; he will come and save you." 
Will thee   not bend a listening ear, and a believing heart to such a   gracious message?
I have added a few thoughts on the last   leaf of the book; and with them wld. give the warm affection   of

Laurel House July 21st/67

My dear Father,
Tom has   written to thee so very lately, that I fear I can hardly   find enough of interest to fill a second letter, & besides I   am almost afraid to write one to go so far, & cost so much;   but perhaps a little Cattskill news would not be unwelcome.    We have been here for several days but owing to the   unkindness of the weather have not been able to accomplish   as much as we could wish – we made one very successful   expedition to Haines’ falls on 6th day morning, we took a   carriage or rather an express-wagon & rode over there, & had   a fine scramble, we went down the stream to the lower falls,   & scrambleddown to the foot, Tom concluded not to go all the way as it   was so rough & hard, & one after another gave out until when   we arrived at the foot there was no one but Harry, Ellie,   Madge & I left, but we were very glad we persevered &   thought ourselves well repaid, you never told us last fall   how beautiful it was.  We did not get home till after they   had gone to dinner so were obliged to go in just as we were   in our mountain dresses, & as we were all prepared concluded   to go under Tom’s guidence to visit Bastion falls   afterwards.  So about 4 we set off prepared to have a very   jolly time, Tom went ahead and cleared the way, & we   followed jumping over the logs & stones which Thomas   declare[d] were not there last fall, & must be the result of   last winters slide;Just as we arrived at the head of the fall, & were   congratulating ourselves on the prospect before us, what   should it do but begin to rain!  At first we thought it   would only be a little shower, & took shelter under the   trees as there were unfortunately no overhanging rocks –   this did very well for a little while, but instead of   stopping the rain got harder & harder, & at last began to   find its way through the trees & onto us – we soon found   ourselves getting very moist, & began to confer on measures   of relief, it was at length concluded as we were already   quite wet, & there was no sign of stopping to start for   home.  At first it seemed to slacked a little & we pushed   bravely on, but it got faster & faster & by the time we   reached the foot of Cauterskillwe were thoroughly drenched & in despair at having to ascend   all those dreadful steps – I wish thee could have seen us as   we came up to the house too tired to run any more dragging   along all dripping & hot, looking as much as possible like   drowned rats.  The gentlemen on the piazza were so polite as   not even to smile, but I’m sure I could not have helped. it.   I don’t think we any of us suffered for it though, & I did   not even feel tired in the evening, this mountain air is so   invigorating.  Yesterday it rained perseveringly & we had to   amuse ourselves as best we could reading, & walking on the   piazza.  The company here is not as congeneal as we could   wish, & we often envy Aunt Annie & Cous. Clem in their   Adirondack society.  One young gentleman regaledus last night with some Scotch songs, but it was very   inferior to Carry Rowland’s performance.  I think Tom told   thee that we have the same room you had last year, & enjoy   it very much, it is so nice having that beautiful view   always before us, I think I enjoy it much more than the map   in front of the Mountain House; it is so constantly   changing, sometimes that distant mountain will be entirely   hid by the clouds, & it is so beautiful to see them coming &   going; we have had no perfectly clear weather since we   arrived, & have become almost discouraged, & the   chamber-maid told me by way of comfort yesterday, that it   sometimes rained strait aheadfor a week, however it really does look like clearing now,   the clouds are drifting away, & there are great patches of   blue-sky.  If it is clear tomorrow we have planned an   expedition to the Plauterkill which I hope will be a   success.  Tom Stokes & Harry had intended starting on a   fishing excursion yesterday but after routing out of their   beds about 4, & eating sandwitches preparatory to starting,   were obliged to give up on account of the rain, & go back to   bed in disgust.  We have only received one letter from home   which reported all well, but by the time this reaches thee   thee will have received more recent news.  All send their   love & wishes for thy welfare wh. means I suppose that they   hope thee is not awfully sick, in which I heartily join,   Thee must notimagin from my description that we are not having a good   time for we are only the rain was a little dampening but   since the sun has come out we feel very lively & up to any   amount of of scrambling.  Write by every steamer & tell us   every thing.
Thy very affectionate
Lily

Philadelphia June 30th   1896

Dear Frank

I am greatly pleased to hear   of your success in adding some more birds to your list, and   especially that you keep up your enthusiasm sufficiently to   keep up active search for birds. I know from personal   experience that there is a tendency in summer vacations to   become lazy, but I hope the mountain air is gong to keep you   active. Water-thrushes always, so far as I have heard, breed   among the rootsof upturned stumps. If there are any such in the swamp it   would pay you to examine them carefully. I hope you   preserved the bird to make sure which species it was. I   suppose it was the small billed one though the Louisiana   species does go as far north as the Water Gap. The Snow   birds you need not regret so seriously, the loss of two will   not materially affect them & they will be very interesting   as indicating more clearly the possible relationship of the   Penna bird to the Carolina [Junes]. I should like to see   them, if you can bring them with you in the fall.

And   now I wish to ask a favor If you should go over to theElk Mt. region I wish you could get me a young Snow Bird –   they have speckled breasts – I am very anxious to secure the   first plumages of all our birds & have nearly all now except   those which breed in the mountains.

If you come   across any young Warblers (except Chest-sided & Black &   White) or any young Thrushes or Savanna Sparrows I should be   just as thankful to get one of them.

I don’t think it   is as bad to kill a young bird as an old one during the   breeding seasonShould you get one you could remove the entrails, put in a   little cotton with some carbolic acid (or plaster) & send it   by mail it will carry all right. Don’t put yourself to   trouble however.

I saw Stew & he greatly regrets his   inability to accept your invitation as you have doubtless   heard from him by this time. He is organizing quite an   expedition of Phila & N.Y. botanists to convene at Pocono   Mts on the 4th

I am always glad to hear from you and   will try to keep the bird interests stirred up by writing to   you

With regards to your family I remain sincerely   yours

I am glad   that thy mind is made up for a peep at this quarter of the   world – I think it will be likely to be beneficial to thy   Health as also to Aunts – Some Rough travell[ing] there will   no doubt be – but generaly speak[ing] the Roads are   tolerable to the mouth of Tunkhannock–  Thereare no excelent Taverns on the Route so far as I am   acquainted–  I think the one Here is the Best & likely to be   the most pleasant for the Residence of aunt–  Gentlemen can   be well accomodated at Easton & at Wilkes barre at Mr Whites   in the first nammed place & at Mr Arndts in the second in   Both Houses there is Rather too much noise and Drink[ing] to   be entirely agreeable to Ladies –  Here also we have more   noise than is pleasant–  There be from 15 to 20 of Stoddarts   work[ing] hands quart[ere]d in the House –  
The Road by   Easton is Rather worse than that by Bethlehem & Nazareth & I   think generaly the accommodations are better on this last   Route–  from Nazareth to Hellers at the Wind gap at which   House I have generaly procured tolerable Eating & pretty   clean–  from thence about 17 miles to William Sox’s upon the   top of Pokono – where th[e]y make prety good coffee & give   you what ever they may Have in the House in a tolerably   cleanly stile–  from thence to this place say 12 miles   –

190 Calvert st

Dear Mother & sisters,   Tired as I am I must write you a few words to night, as I   shall probably be at the sch, in the morn & the mail closes   at 1 P.M. & I thought you’d like to know that we arrived   safely about 5 this aft. & I am installed in my new boarding   house wh. promises to be very nice.  They ladies were   exceedingly kind & welcomed me as if I had been an old   friend  They are so free & easy.  One of them Miss Talbot   came right up in my room & talked to me while I was getting   dressed – & was as kind as possible  They used to know uncle   Jasper & quantities of our friends, so that I begin to feel   quite at home already  It is a large 4story house with a very nice pleasant parlor, & a   comfortable dining room, where we had tea on a little   refreshment table—the 4 school “marms”—as cozy as possible.    They say “thee” & call me by name wh. makes me feel much   less strange
Jesse called a few minutes after we arrived   in his elegant carriage, having been to one of the dipots to   meet us, but we unfortunately had got out at the wrong one;   & very much out of our way.  The ladies seem in very   moderate circumstances only keeping one servant, & a sch. of   near 40 day scholars.   consequently they have not much time   to attend to housekeeping nor much talent in that way I shd.   think.  Their kindness however makes amends.The house is on a very high situation & there is a fine view   of the city fr[m]. my room, wh is in the 2nd story & very   airy & pleasant.  But there is no closet unfortunatley wh.   is remarkably home like & seems to be my fate.  Not a place   to hang a dress, but I have 5 beaureau drawers & can make   out.  So much for the house.  3rd day morn.  We went last   evening to see the sch. & I was most agreeably disappointed   in it in every respect..  The rooms are well ventilated &   airy & no disagreeable odour.  & their state of advancement   is surprising.  There were a few to be sure who reminded me   of Busy—in his attempt to spell girl—but mostly they were   astonishingly quick--& cld. add & subtract like quite   accomplished arithmeticaians.  Quite as fast as I cld.   myself.  They were mostly adults.  In the morningThey are children.
I am to have a class of 30 & am very   glad to find that I shall be in the school with Miss Field,   who is a very pleasant young lady about my own age I shd.   judge, & we can go backwards & forward to gether, & shall be   companionable I hope.  The morning session is frm. 9 till 1   1/2 not 3.  The evening teaching you can take part in or not   as you choose.  So it will not be very laborous & in every   respect, it is going to be I think, much pleasanter than I   had anticipated.  & if you are only satisfied I think I can   be very comfortable & enjoy the work & the change.Love to Cousin Sarah.

But if you really think it worth the trouble
If   twill not seem like too great love of mammon
I think you   can get quite as much or double

But as in   olden time, when-freshly sprung
From the great Maker’s   hand – all Earth was fair
Excelling in its beauty – fresh   & young
When strength & health perfumed with the balmy   air 
And all Earth’s Gifts were far beyond compare   
With what now ‘neath Heaven’s weary blessing   grows
What time the grove Hesperia apples bare
From   out the salt salt wave fair Venus rose
Graceful her   dripping locks she round her did dispose

So from the   Sorrow tearful deep & sad
Which mourns thy memory   departed Shade
While oer the dust which erst thy spirit   clad
And the loved link which bound thee to us made
We   grieve thou coulds’t not Death’s cold hand evade
Who   plucks the brightest flowers – hard to please
[While]   tears fall fast from all that thou shouldst fade
Love   ever radiant though steeped in tears
Love-rosy tints the   clouds – Love sooths the foamy seas
or Love heavenly love   appears
Just as you please

all the while alluding   in an inexpressibly delicate manner to the very peculiar   situation in which Miss B. ----- and I find ourselves since   Harry’s departure  You may show them to the lady.  Present   them as the first fruits. ----
But enough of this nonsense -  If you are heartily tired of   it remember you began it. --  and when my Muse gets well   under weigh – like Addisons there’s no stopping her. -------   Father has been unwell for some time and so much so that a   good part of the business devolves on me – in connection   with some other domestic affairs – putting a very unlooked   for and regrettable veto on my proposed trip to Philada   –
Perhaps another year may bring around the same   expectations which I hope will not be disappointed
Before   that time however I trust to see you on [here] for although   it is not to be presumed that New Bedford alone should   possess sufficient attractions – to be the terminus of your   visit it may serve as a [stepping] stone to some place that   has more ---

Dear Frank 

I saw a history of   Susquehanna Co Pa. the other day and in it were a few notes   on birds & mammals contributed I think by a man named   Jennings The notes were sufficient to show that whatever   else Mr. Jennings may be he is not much of an   ornithologist.

He says however that Dr.L. A. Smith of New Milford has a nearly complete collection   of the birds of Susquehanna Co. mounted.

How accurate   this statement may be I cannot say but as I see that New   Milford is not very far from Montrose I thought you might be   able to drive over there and hunt up the Dr. and perhaps he   could give you some valuable notes. At any rate I thought I   had better let you know about him.

I expect to leave   next week for the Catskills

With kind regards to your   family I am sincerely yours

Dear Sister–
I   recieved thy note (for I cannot call it a letter because it   contained so much nonsense) yester-day morning; but I did   not say poo! because I had an idea it was from Rachel or at   least hoped it did not contain nonsense.  I was glad to   recieve such information as thy note contained, & thought it   was a great compliment to be called handsome by sombody,   although I do not think father was much complimented by   having his hair called an iron gray color; unfortunatly I   did not lose my heart with her, although I think I must have   seen her & was very sorry I could not go to meting but my   knee was not equal to it.  I could have found some time to   write to you or thee butI have been very lazy since I have been here.  I delivered   thy message to Father (about Dr Thomas) but fear he has   forgotten about it, so I will remind him of it & now I must   close for I am getting lazy & will tell thee what we are   doing when there is some thing to tell about of more   consequence.  I believe Mother intends writing a   P.S.

I am sorry there should be any   mistake about Dr. Thomas  I thought I told you, you would   have to send him word when you were ready to begin  You had   better tell him of myabsence from home so that he may understand why he was not   called on before.

Locust Shade. 3. 15. 1865

My dear Annie

Does   thee think I have quite forgotten thee and all thy kindness,   & my delightful visit to you? That I have been such a long   while without writing to thee. Indeed I have not, & never   shall I hope- but my wonderings [early] terminated last 7th   day & since then I have had a very bad cold, which thee   knows makes one lazy. - I have wanted to know how thee   faired after our parting on the hill. My walk was brisk & I   did not keep Maggie’s [---] waiting long, and did not feel   tired. I fear thee did not fare so well. Our visit to our   Wilmington friends was very pleasant.
Richie, thee knows, joined me in that. Tho he was not well   enough to enjoy it thoroughly. Lizzie seems very happy & we   hope is learning something, - at least she gets very good   numbers. - The roads were so bad it was not easy to get   about & my journey to Faulkland was a [arduous] one. but the   pleasure of cheering cousin Mary a little & hearing Dr   [Fell]  talk,- a great deal more than repaid me for it.-   

When I returned to Phila John & Sallie Hilles & I   went over to see Charles Rhoads. It was very touching to see   those five little motherless children. Charles looks tens   years older and much broken down.- His sister was very   pleasant- I never knew her before. They are certainly much   favored in having such kind caretakers & hardly feel their   loss as they will after awhile. - I often think of   what

thee said to me in the car after our visit to Clemmy. dear   Annie, with loving sympathy. Deserving too that I may fully   appreciate the blessing of a mothers love while mine is   still spared to me. - I hear Clemmy is going, or has gone to   Baltimore, to teach the Freedmen. What do you think of it?   It seems to me that anything that would give interesting   employment to both mind and body, would be good for her. Tho   I’m right sorry to have her go so far away. - Thee will miss   her too. - Do write some & tell me all about her plans. -   Lilly Collins seems to like her situation very well. I found   a letter from her awaiting me on my return.- She gives an   amusing account of a colored meeting which she attended, - a   real happy [----------] affair.- Lilly enjoys the variety I   should think & it keeps her from being homesick.- Cousin   Elizalooked & seemed more cheerful when I called - but she   certainly is very weak.-

I suppose the preparations   for the wedding are proceeding briskly- Does the go? I quite   want to hear about it. - Lizzie Brown’s sister is to be   married tomorrow & I hope the threatened storm will not come   to spoil all their nice dresses.- Lizzie’s friend Edward   Balderson stayed with us last night. He is to wait on a   young lady from Jersey -  so I fear the love affair between   him & Lizzie is all over - but time will make manifest. Has   thee seen anything more of the interesting students- Till   thy brother Thomas his opinion of the [-----] position of   Carpenters is very family impressed upon my mind.- It makes   me smile now to think how frightened I was, I deserved   rebuke too.- Do please write to me soon dear Annie.- My love   please to thy father & sister E & with a large share of the   same for thyself I am thy sincerely attached & grateful   friend

Thee will reccollect my dear Brother that when I last saw thee I promised to write to thee in a short time.  Thee will conclude that my short time is a pretty long one but I have been pretty constantly employed since I returned and have not felt in a very letter-writing humour.  I wrote to Caroline about 3 weeks ago and have not yet received an answer I hope thee will prove a better correspondent than she or I shall have but little encouragement to write.  I have begun tolearn french and I like it very much as far as I have gone.  Sister Rachel told me when I was at [Home] that Hannah Bolton had returned from Weston I should be obliged if thee would give my love to her when thee sees her.  Thee desired to know what I was studying.  I am studying, Geography, Grammar, history and spelling and at present how to write a letter worth reading.  Tell sister Rachel I should be pleased to receive a letter from her though I am not willing to risk writing just again but if she will write to me I will endeavour to be more punctual in the answering of her's than I have been of thine.
When thee writes please to tell me how mother is for I believe all ourfamily have forgotten me and therefore I need not look for a letter from any of them.  Tell Alfred I will answer his letter as soon as I possibly can.  mean-while he must wait patiently.  I must now stop for the present as school is just going to close.
Thee desires to know how the swelling is behind my ear I believe it is much the same as it was when I left home.
Please to give my love to Father, Mother, Grandmother, Rachel, William, Caroline & Alfred and accept a large share for thyself & little Mary From thy affectate sister

Schooley's Mountain Aug 17. '42 

Dear Sister Rachel

We had so uneventful a journey, I have been so quiet since our arrival here, that I have scarcely material for a letter. Travellers are expected, I believe, to be particularly entertaining. Now, there is no time when I feel less so. Fatigue, change of air & diet, always for a time, affect my health unfavorably; and then, the turmoil & bustle scatter the little wits I possess. So that, from home, I am an especially stupid correspondent. Still, as you were kind enough to wish to hear from us, and as we exchanged promises about writing, I will not wait for any thing worth saying, --as I may not have it at all, thee knows; -- and my delay may occasion me the disappointment of not receiving here, the speedy return letter from Fourth St, which is to be my reward.-- 

We had quite a pleasant time so far as Trenton, for our first day's exploit. We arrived there about half past five o'clock; and George with our baggage, via. steam-boat and rail-road, very shortly after. In the evening, we made a little visit to Elizabeth Gummere, who lives near the Hotel. They have a fine, large house, in a pleasant part of town, & express themselves, the young folks, most emphatically, pleased with their change of residence. As we were in the immediate neighborhood, we went with Eliza..th, to spend a few minutes with our old friend, Judge Gordon's wife. She looks and seems just the same asI recollect her in the days of my childhood. So it appears that in this bustling life, there are some not easily jostled out of their way. We found the Judge, some years ago, busy with his attempts to sell his map of New Jersey. It still seems a most interesting theme to him; & if we come this way six years hence, I dare say he will even then be ready to speak of its merits & to state that his stock is not yet exhausted.-- Fifth day night brought us within twelve miles of the mountain, and the next day at noon, we reached the end of our journey--and over such roads! I was thinking, perpetually, of the children's song "Here we go up, up, up, & here we go down, down" &c &c. To adopt little Cary's favourite style, the rain had washed such gulleys in the roads, & the stones were so bare, & there were so many of them!-- 
The first two days after we got here, we had three or four showers per day. By way of consolation, we were told, this was a favorable specimen of their weather this season. For the previous ten days, it had rained all the time. "Recorder [Vaux?]" who is here, calls it temperance weather. I wonder if [Espy] is a tee-totaller.--We were beguiled , when we first came, into taking a room in "the cottage" Its superior dimensions, privacy &c were warmly insisted upon. And as we like plenty of room, and don't like much noise, we thought it quite a prize. The sun shone so flatteringly upon the [compact?], that we never thought of the inconvenience of being drenched in going to our meals, or having them drenched  in being brought to us. As we have now had ample opportunity of trying it both ways, and don't relisheither, we begin to murmer. Coming in search of Health, we fancy too, that a sleeping apartment on the ground floor is not exactly the place to meet with her ladyship, this damp summer. We have some of the inconvenient "[Fine-ear]" family, moreover, next us, who have been very near getting us into a scrape. A grand-daughter of John Jacob Astor has been stoping with a Mr Kane, from Albany, and, under what her friends consider, very aggravated circumstances. They came here to spend the Honey moon, & unfortunately, were placed in the room adjoining ours. Job related to me, one day, in a confidential tone of voice, the history of their flight, as just detailed to him by Governor Coles. This they contrived to over-hear, & being displeased thereat, they imagined a series of questions and answers,-- Job & I being the speakers,-- about the pedigree, personal consequence &c of many of the boarders, which they carried directly to the individuals about whom we were said to be so curious, & from there, they came immediately back to us. Happily, they fixed upon people whom we knew perfectly well, & thus the absurdity of our asking who they were whom we had known all our lives, was sufficiently apparent, & created only a little merriment. But we were somewhat annoyed until we discovered the full extent of this eaves-dropping. Thus, the storms without, & the treachery within doors, have given us a thorough distaste to this part of the premises. Besides, there is more of a crowd than we wished to get into, & if the company does not diminish, we shall want to try some quieter region. Direct, here, however, as we shall leave instructions for letters tobe sent to us. -- We have had it very warm & almost clear now for a couple of days, & have been enjoying it by driving about. The country is sufficiently beautiful to render the slow climbing of hills by no means a tedious affair. The roads are kept in quite tolerable order, & occasionally, we come to a level piece of ground where we trot away quite merrily. People tell us wonders about the flush gained and the disease lost among these hills. I hope our cases may add to a reputation, so richly earned, according to all accounts. -- I should write to Caroline, but I am not a very disinterested letter writer; sowing only where I may hope to reap, --& I fear she is scarcely yet at home.--I should like much, to know how you all are, where you now are, & where you are to be for he next few weeks.--Does thee know where Father & Mother are & when Cara returns? When do you go to Susquehanna [---] & how are Anne's eyes? Tell her I have not seen a single cat since I left home; but we have plenty of little ducks & chickens, the feeding of which is a daily source of amusement to the children. I heard them complaining this morning, that the older ladies were interfering with this, their peculiar privilege. Indeed the belles and beaux seem to find it quite as entertaining as they--remember, my dear R, that thee is bound to procure me a letter, in some way. Either from under thy own hand, (how is it?) or from one of those to whom thee can say "do this & he doeth it." If thee is not well enough, I shall calculate a little, too, on the affection & kindness of my nephews & niece. I do not know whether it will be any thing of a bribe-but I always make it a point to answer letters addressed to me--some time or other. If I should not

Dear Lily
I got thy very nice note day before yesterday and was very glad to get it. Yesterday was very rain and about 7 o-clock  it just poured. Haines and High Street & Locust Avenue bridges were all washed away and a man and a and a boy were going along Locust avenue after darkand the lamps were not lit because of the rain I suppose and the both of them were drowned. Uncle Harry & Aunt Mary and Anna are staying over here and we are having a splendid time. Brother Jonnie & Chellie & Hazen came home yesterday to dinner and we think they look better except Hazen but we are going to sent him down to Atlantic City tomorrow to get fat. Cousin Clemmie came over to meeting today and went to Uncle Tom's to dinner. I am going to wait till Alexis is smart enough to writeto me before I write to him.

I should like to hear from you for we have not had a letter since we have been back.  I would wish to know if anything is the matter as Henry has written several times I beleive. We have had apples handed out several times and once we had 5 a-piece and I expect we shall have the liberty of the peach orchard when the peaches are ripe. I would like to know if Arthur and Henry intend to go out to sea again and if they do where they will go to. Thou must write to us as soon as thou canst either third fifth or seventh days will do.

Dear Henry

 I was yesterday at your house where thy Mother handed me a letter from thee.  I find thee expects me to write to thee in answer to thy question about Williams writeing to you.  I answer yes Cousin Lydea stays with thy Mother, and Susquehannah is arrived, the Marchants seems pretty quiet about the Embargo.  They don't expect it will continue long.  I often think of thee with strong desire for thy wellfare.  I hope thy study about Learning & wanting to know a great Deal about Causes and Effects won't occupy so much of thy mind as to have no leasure to make ready, & be prepared for a better inheratence that will be lasting and perminent, as all things here are uncertain.  I have been thinking about my Son Henry when about thy age he was very anxious about Learning & knowing the cause of this or that.  He Thursted after Knowledge.  I was setting where he was at work brushing Hats.  He put down his work and took up the pen and wrote down his thoughts as they [----] in his mind.  I got the paper from him with reluctance on his part.I was much pleas'd to find his mind was so well occupied.  I remember the lines & thought it would not hurt thee at least the poetry is not elegant but the desire was commendable.
Let not vain Learning lead my steps aside
 Be not my mind be puff't up with empty pride
 The Worm that seems by night with fire to glow
 In vain to light his torch a man may blow
 But O thou source of wisdom by my guide
In vertues paths direct me to Abide 
Teach me to know thee that I Bless may be
And with thy Saints share Immortality.
Perhaps this may be the last letter thee will have from me.  My love is to Frances. I could not write to him as I expect we shall have him with us befor long, and in the Spring I hope if I should live so long I shall see thee.  With much love and affection I remain thy grandmother>br>Rachel DrinkerJames Sherwood was the candidate.  We are all in health.  I hope this will find you in the same.

Title: 1819 October 9, Philadelphia, to Ellen

I have just recieved my dear Ellens Letter of 5th addess'd to me; and am much more pleased with the stile in which it is written, than I was with the one that preceded it, address'd to thy Sister.  The latter done no credit either to thy heart or judgement.  Thy Father condemned it in to-to, as the sauciest little girls Letter he thought he had ever seen; & thou knowest he is not very rigid; or as some would say, not at all particular or precise; so when he is offended thou mayest conclude thy improprieties must be very striking indeed.  My Daughter should ever recollect that when she asks a favor, it should not be in the high tone of a demand: it should not be claimed as a Right, which if not immediately complied with is to be forthwith resented as an injury; but when she wishes for attentions, her wishes should be modestly insinuated, not as tho' she believed them due to her merit, on account of her great worth & services for which she expected extraordinary returns; but as tho her Affection prompted her to desire them, at the same time that she was conscious she could do & had done but little, for her friends; while their time & thought, & industry was often exerted in providing for her Wants, & promoting her Welfare.  This would lead her to be content with such portions as they could conveniently bestow, & grateful when she recieved them: she would dwell upon every instance of their kindness & cherish the remembrance of it, as an evidence of love for which she had never, as yet, had the power to render an equivalent, & she would hasten to qualify herself to become useful to them, in her turn, especially to her Mother, who, if she lives, must shortly be overtaken by Age & its attendant infirmities.  Then the kind offices, the endearments & domestic services of a dutiful affectionate Daughter, are an invaluable treasure.  These considerations, when once embraced, cannot fail to sink deep in the heart of sensibility" & will, if cherished, bring forth those substantial [-------] of Virtue in my beloved daughter, which my heartincessantly longs for.  After all my dear Ellen, I still flatter myself, that in regard to the said saucy letter the fault lays more in the manner & language, than the heart that dictated it:  I am by no means displeased that thou should'st prize our love & cover the marks of it; & am in hopes that the fear, the dread, & horror of being hated (so earnestly express'd & often repeated) will operate to induce thee to be best calculated to win back affection, even if it has fled.  But on this subject I need not enlarge.  Thou knowest well what my desires for thee are.  Thou hast only to look back & reflect on my frequent labors of love, & painful anxieties on thy account (lest thou should not be what my heart craves,) and it will be enough: - yet there is one still remains untouch'd, on which I feel in duty bound to refresh thy memory.  I mean the observance of respect to thy Teachers & superintendants; absolute & complete perfection is seldom found among Mortals; as least it takes (in most of us) nearly a whole Life to attain it: do not therefore indulge a disposition in thyself, neither take part with any who do so, to make exceptions or look out for faults in those who have so great a weight of Care & responsibility upon them; but rather turn thy attention to thy own deficiencies & need of improvement.  If their patience & sweetness is not uniform, recollect that thy own, if in their situation, would probably come far short of what is expected , remember that it is for the sake of order, & for thy own, or the general good.  By forgetfulness or ignorance of these truths, Children often display the weakness of their understandings, their excess of selfish feeling, & total want of feeling for others.  It is never too early to begin to do good, & few little girls, who were resolved to make a firm stand against these errors: but it must begin at one, & how proud should I be, would but my Ellen resolve to be that one what a happiness would it be to know that she had been the instrument of giving a new tone of feeling & action to the whole of the little community of which she is a Member - a tone so correct & beautiful too, as to excite general approbation!on the contrary, what a pain to find her banded with a company not only so childish, but so vulgar, so void of all true taste ; so void of all gentility, refinement & delicacy - so completely low, as to speak of "throwing old shoes &c" - Indeed I am almost ashamed to write it, or think of it.  Those who desire respect or attention for themselves - who expect ever to be esteemed as gentlewomen, should have more regard to propriety & true dignity of character.

Thy copy of Verses is very pretty, & if they express thy own thoughts & feelings, very acceptable ; except the last stanza, which represents a forlorn destitute state, not at all applicable to thy situation.  As to thy request about a jingling Letter, I must inform thee that such music is not always at my finger ends - & for thyself I would much rather thou would'st improve in good prose-writing , before any attempt at poetry is made - unless indeed it should come of itself without such "hard striving".
It was singular I think that thou should'st dream of thy Grandmother Cope never having seen her - but I have no doubt the inscription on white, which thou could'st not read is indeed of thy admirable Brother.  For him was exemplified all that gentleness & delicacy of character, which I so warmly recommend to my Ellen.  In whatever School or family he was placed his behaviour, & his memory now, that he has left the World & all us, [--] less pure inhabitants to mingle in the Society of angelic Spirits; & his watery Urn has been plentifully bedew'd with those tears of sadness which mingled, as it were with the waves that overwhelmed him; now, henceforth & forever, will the remembrance of him be precious; yea, sweeter than a garden of Roses after the Summer.

I expect thy Grandmother D-r every minute from Burlington-- Thy various messages have mostly been delivered, & all desire their love in return - (Mariam in particular) - thy  Brother Henry cannot recollect about M.G.'s Letter: but if he had the charge of it I dare answer for his punctuality.  If he does not often send his love in form, he loves thee none the less.  I believe he has hope of thee, for he sometimes comforts me by saying he thinks thy faults are much like his own were at thy age; only, his were in thought, for he was affraid to shew them because he knew they were not allowed: indeed he did not dare to let them be seen, lest he should give offence: for he loved his parents tenderly, & could not bear to give them pain; & I have heard him say when a Boy, on seeing others misbehave - get into disgrace - & excite disgust, - I am glad my parents never suffered me to get into such habits.  Now there is this difference between you, supposing you both to have been under the same temptations to evil in your childhood - that all thy virtue will be voluntary, & therefore more meritorious - that is, it will originate in a love of goodness, & desire to attain it, in thy own breast, & for its own sake - whereas he was assisted in his endeavours by the Authority of his parents, & the divine blessing superadded to both; and thou hast beenleft more to thyself: at least in thy education, persuasion has been used more than compulsion.  Let me entreat thee therefore my Daughter, not to dissapoint thy Father; when belief has been so sanguine that his Daughters could be won to Virtue thro' the medium of the Understanding, by the force of Reason & good counsel; yet tho I entreat thee, I know - & I am in duty bound to tell thee so - I know, that without earnest & frequent intercession, with thy Saviour, in true humility of heart, accompanied by love of his divine perfections, & fear of offending him - in short, without his aid & blessing, thou can'st do nothing:  As he said himself - "Without me of yourselves, ye can do nothing": - So, tho' it is possible to conform to outward rules of good behaviour, at times, & for a time, (which is better than being always bad) yet to become establish'd to be immovable in virtuous intention, to be steadfast in resisting every temptation to evil, is impossible without him:  for this cause is he stiled a Saviour, a Redeemer from the bondage of Sin; and we are assured by a revelation from God "that there is no name given under Heaven or amongst men, whereby they can be saved, but by the name of Jesus" - How great then is his goodness & how much do we owe him who tho' he needs nothing from us, has given his Life for us in the body of flesh be assumed; & ever stands, as it were knocking at our hearts by his gentle checks & intimations wooing us to good - meeting & strengthening our feeble desires after it - & all for the sake of our eternal happiness!

Well my dears, thou wilt perhaps think, if I have not written thee many Letters, I am making up for it in the length of this: and not to tire thee quite out I will now conclude
Thy truly loving mother
Mary Cope
P.S. Mother is not come; but we hear is coming the last of next Week.  Thy Capes are done, I was pleased with thy proposition to make them thyself, as a mark of industry; but would rather thee would make the shirt to learn to darn neatly.  We have had so much company (not many at a time, but almost constantly somebody) - & have had so much to do since we opened the house, that we have been pinched for time to do all.  Louisa, too, having a gathering on her hand could not work, & did not come home when we expected her.  She is not come yet.  Does thee know her?  She is Uncle Israels - Jem's sister, & our Joseph's Cousin, & my Cook.

It   was my first 1st day in Baltimore.  Do you remember last 1st   day, when [were] were walking on the piazza & wondering   whether I shd. be here?  I did not much think I shd. then   but it seems I am.  Went to meeting yesterday morn. wh. I   quite enjoyed.  The only faces that I had ever seen before   were Deborah Thomas, Margy Coale & Tammie Miller.  I was   introduced to lots of others who were all very kind, & said   they were coming to see me.  There was a frd. named Elicott   & her two sisters who I think said they knew Mother.  We had   a sermon [fmr.] Deba  Thomas, the Dr, & one or two others.    After meeting in the aftnoon I set out to take a walk & was   joined by a young lady named Mary Elicott & & Jesse, who   took me a beautiful walk out to whats called theReservoir, where there is a fountain and a splendid view of   green hills & also of the distant waters of the bay, as well   as of parts of the city.  & yet it was not a walk of more   than a mile I shd. think
Baltimore is certainly a   beautiful place & I never realized before so fully what an   advantage what an advantage a hilly city possesses over a   flat one.  It quite throws Philada into the shade as far as   beauty is concerned.  There is such a refreshing variety in   the style of the houses, & other [buildings] & the hills   show them off to great advantage.  Charles St. seems to be   one of the most aristocratic in wh. the monument is   situated, a very beautiful column of white marble, 170 ft   high wh. as it stands upon a hill serves as a land mark for   a long distance round.  as you ascend the street with the   monument towering high above you the stars & stripes   floating over it & the city as you catch glimpses of it at   certain points apparently beneath you, the effect is very   imposing.  I think Phila. wld. strike one as flat after   this.  It has its advantages tho’.
Jesse has not come to   take us any rides yet.  tho he has promised to.  They say he   is very attentive to a certain – young lady here so we shall   not be so likely to derive as much benefit.  [---]. He has   been very polite so far.  & the ladies of the house are   continually laying plans for our entertainment wh. is   exceedingly kind in them.  I really feel more at home here   than I wd with some relations!Miss Talbot who is the housekeeper is one of the easy   talkative kind & makes me think a little of Mary Sayne.    Only far Superior.  they are exceedingly informal & get up &   wait on table & clear the things away in what thee, Nat,   wld. call a very shocking manner, but they are perfect   ladies for all – hospitable & fond of society, & they seem   to have a great many pleasant frds.  Their one girl is not   the most efficient cook in the world but I have such a good   appetite that I get along very well, – I feel most as hungry   as when I get home frm. school as I remember I used to when   I was a scholar.  We have breakfast about 7 1/2 go to sch.   about 8 1/4.  it is only 10 min. walk — get home about 1.   pretty tired with the 4 hrs. standing & ready to lie down   till dinner time at 2 1/2.  After dinner we get dressed & go   out or see company.  We most always have one or two callers.   at 7 again we have tea & then get our work and sit in the   parlor, & wonder who is coming when the bell rings.  Miss   Field I like exceedingly.  She is a Presbyterian & a very   superior girl I shd. think so that in the matter of   companionship I need to have had fewer fears and   trepidations than I had
The school duties are not long   but pretty arduous while they last.  We have to stand nearly   all the time.  At least the model teachers do, but we   inferiors take the liberty of popping downoccasionally, but it is at the risk of [good] order for   there are so many in the room that unless you stand up to   it, & keep your eye on all 30 or 40 at once they are very   apt to get wrong in the back seats.  One of the first points   is to get [them] disciplined.  Mr Waterman the principal –   drills his class just as you wld. soldiers makes them fold   their arms put out one foot & finally stand up just as a   general wld. his troops, & when school is dismissed they   file out in quite an imposing manner.  That is to teach them   obedience I suppose, wh. is a great point gained.  They also   teach them a kind of gymnastic exercises by way of   recreation. as they have no place to play & consequently no   regular recess or almost none.  Mine is the next to the   smallest class. & only studys reading & spelling in words of   4 or 5 letters wh. is not very interesting.  I have’nt   discovered that there are any specially smart or Topsy like   ones among them.  We dont stop to talk or get acquainted   much but just keep them doing something or other the whole   time.  Upon the whole I enjoy the effect of the work very   much. & outside of that it is all very pleasant.
Jesse   has just called in a splendid barouche to ask for Miss F or   I to ride.  As I had’nt finished my letter & she had’nt been   out for sev. days I persuaded her to go.  Yesterday was the   first pleasant one we have had. since I have been here.  I   was so sorry I took my purple dress out.  It is just what I   want this cool weather for afternoons.  I want twice as many   clothes here as at home.  Caroline dont thee want to be   benevolent and cut me out a pair of those round cuffs like   thee made me for undersleeves.  Thee can work the button   holes, & have them starched & ironed.  I have a pair of   sleevesthat I can sew them on.  I wish if you shd. have any   opportunity you wld. send me my old blk silk body wh. hangs   in the back room closet.  Tammy Miller is going to P   tomorrow & out to Mary Morris’ so I told her to tell you   that she saw the school “mam”  Give my love to Cousin Frank   & Mary  Tell Cousin Mary I had the pleasure of seeing her   mother & I think her father yesterday.  Give my love to   Cous. Sarah & to Tom & Harry & to all Aunt Carolines & any   other enquiring frds.
I have written you a lengthy   epistle I hope there’ll be an exception in favor of mistakes   & bad writing as I have written lying on my back  I was so   very tired this morning that I was too lazy to sit up.  I do   not get much time to [sun] as my room is too cold to sit in   & they do not seem to bring their sewing into the parlor   much.  With much love

First day eve 5/7

Dear Mother   &c

Altho’ it is after 10 o’ck I want to just drop you   a line to tell you to look out for a call from a young   gentleman this week.  Jesse sent me word to day that he was   going [on] himself to P & out to Mary Yarnalls & that he wd.   give you a call & bring or take anything I wanted so here is   a chance again for the silk skt. only I wld nt like to ask   him to bring it, as I think he only offered out of   politeness & will probably take nothing with him but a   valise & as mine is a plain silk & wd. not bear rumpling, I   guess it had better not be sent altho’ I told him I shd. be   obliged to him to bring a small package.  If thee Mother cd.   sendme thy old light silk skt. (wh. I believe thee offered) it   wld. do as well to wear with white bodies, & cld be put in   smaller space.  But I really wd not like to ask Jesse to   bring it, for he is so polite that he wd. say it was   convenient whether it was or not.  If however you cd. manage   to get up a sack or shawl that wd. do for sch. (wh. subject   I mentioned in my last letter) I shd. be very glad to have   it.  Jesse returns on 5th day,--so his call will be sometime   between this & then, He proposed that I shd. go with him &   pay a short visit, wh. I declined of course.  His dinner   party did’nt come off last week as we expected, but probably   will next.  Tell C & A that at a tea party a few eve since   at frd. Janney I met their old sch. mate Josy Hoag  She   asked after them & quite amused me by saying that she had   often heard of [---] “Sister Clemmy.”  She’s a sort of bride   having married a person by the name of Hopkins.  She seemed   to be more interested in her husband than anything..  Tell   Edgar I was escorted home by a youth named Joe Hopkins who   asked me if I was any relation to Edgar Cope an old school   mate of his--I said yes & asked what kind of a young man he   was--”a very clever fellow he said but very lazy”, in wh.   lattercharacteristic he said they greatly resembled each other    Mister H. is what you’d call a rather fast young man I shd.   think, a variety wh. I think a good many of the young men   here belong to.

On 6th day eve took tea at Thos.   Matthews about 5 m. in the country.  We met there E. Smith   of West Chester.  An Aunt of the Rileys & sister of Rhoda’s.   She is making a visit to these frds. & is a very pleasant   person  A great many Phila’s seem to [stray] down this way.    Emma Parry & some of the Perots are here now I believe.  The   Coales told me to day that Cous. Mary was talking of coming.   Margy amuses me very much by saying she does hope she’ll see   a good deal of me when she is in P this summer she does not   seem to think that in B it is [deemed] as I have never been   invited there.

Dear Annie,

This is the first sheet of that ream of paper, but for fear thee should be appalled with the anticipation of having the whole of it filled up to thy account, I am going to tell thee in the first place that I ai'nt going to be quite so unconscionable tho' I wont promise how I far I shall short of it.  I thought maybe you would like to know something about my gettings along on my journey, so I will begin at Pottstown up to which place you are informed of what transpired.  Well after taking the last look at you, I turned round & felt a little forlorn at finding nothing but my carpetbag to keep me company, so as I had nobody to talk to (I was very glad I had'nt) I thought I would occupy myself with thinking about you & wondering how you were getting along.  Directly after we started we came whizzing past a train of cars, which I supposed were the ones wh. were to convey you back to Philada.  I was very glad to see them because I knew you would be & I was afraid you might have had to wait there a good while, but it was'nt very pleasant to think that we were speeding away from each other as fast as we could go.  I hope you did'nt feel as [worn] & dusty when you got to Phila as I did when I reached Port Clinton I had'nt much time to think about it however for I had to go quite in traveller like style & superintend as well as I could amid the bustle & din the transportation of our baggage from one car to another, that seen to, I joined my companions & weput ourselves on board the cars for Tamaqua, a ride of two hours brought us to that place about 1 o'clock, there we staid about half an hour most of wh. time I spent in trying to restore my face to a decent shade of color, for I found it in the funniest looking condition thee can imagine, the dust, & the tears occasioned by the cinders, (& something else) had covered [skin] spots with a sort of black paste wh. very much resembled mud & wh. I had some difficulty in removing.  I thought it expedient to [see first] watering place to get out & wash so I performed my ablutions quite comfortably under the spout where the horses were drinking, it reminded me of Aunt Fortunes style of face washing.  The ride over the mountains was just about as usual, except that it was a little bit hotter & dustier & disagreeabler than ever.  We had 9 passengers in the stage not counting carpetbags & blanket shawls wh are an important item in hot weather I hope I have left mine for the enjoyment of somebody who will take a cooler time for it.  We lived all the afternoon in the anticipation of a cooler ride after sunset, but it seemed to grow hotter instead of colder, most of the passengers seemed to forget their discomforts in a nap so I was left to my own entertainment & sat very quietly in one corner thinking about different things among others I amused myself with imagining what you were about at, Oakland, & wishing I was there with you instead of where I was, about 11 1/2 P.M. we were wheeled up before the Phoenix Hotel in Wilkesbarre where as soon as possible (tho' not until morning) we made our way to our sleeping apartments mine did not prove to be much of a sleeping apartment however tho' as much as could have been expected of a roomwithout windows & with featherbeds, they were very full at the Hotel & we were obliged to be content with the kind of accomodations we could get.  Thinking to better my condition I got up the next morning at half past three & found it a decided improvement upon lying in bed We left [W] about 7 o'clock & had a pleasant ride thro' the valley of Wyoming, it is by far the pleasantest part of the journey I think, the country is looking beautifully now, only it was too hot to enjoy it.  We reached Tunkhannock about 12 1/2 PM, & now comes the very dismalest part of all, at this place the two lades with whom I had travelled from Phila & whom I knew very well left me unexpectedly, & I was packed without any ceremony into a kind of open arrangement upon wheels (for it hardly deserved the name of a wagon) & after considerable crowding & pushing, & groaning I managed to squeze in between two fat women & an indiscriminate collection of trunks, & handboxes, & men.  Under these auspicious circumstances we started, the sun basking down upon us in one direction, & some ominous looking black clouds in another, so [hot] I scarcely knew whether to wish most for a drenching or a coo[k]ing I an addition to this the driver was entertaining us with all sorts of awful predictions, he said the roads were terrible, that the bridge had been washed away & he expected we would all be drowned in crossing the creek, & as to his horses he was perfectly certain they never could stand it, & so I thought I shd never get home in the world, that something awful certainly could'nt fail to happen among so many dismal predictions, & they were such a queer set of people, & altogether I felt such an utter sense of forlornness that I eddified them by beginning to cry.  I was provoked at myself for being so foolish but I really could'nthelp it, it did'nt last very long however, for directly one man who seemed to quite pity me turned round & said in the most compassionate tone, "you feel kind'er used up do'nt you."  I was so struck with the applicability of the expression (for in truth I did feel a sort of sense of "goneness") that I began to laugh, & seeming quite pleased that his efforts were so successful, the man set himself to work to entertain me during the rest of the way, he said he always kind, o' hated to see people discouraged, that he never got discouraged in his life & he thought it was'nt a good plan, & so he got me into quite a composed state of mind & I was enabled to bear the rest of the journey with a tolerable degree of calmness, it is well disagreeable things come to an end as well as agreeable ones, thee may imagine how delighted it was to be safely landed at home after all this, without being either drowned or drenched, they were quite surprised to see me arriving in such a forlorn condition.  If Father & mother had known they wd have met me at Tunkhannock.  I believe the reason of our having such a miserable affair was that the stage had broken down the day before, & this was all they had to send.  They are all very well here excepting father who is somewhat stiff yet with the effects of the rheumatism, the children have grown very much.  And now that I have almost filled my letter with an acct of my own doings, let me ask thee about yours.  I want to know how you are getting along, it seems ages since I have heard anything about you.  I do hope thee'll write very soon & tell me about everything.  I feel somehow as if I was farther away than I ever was before, do come up this summer if you possibly can, any of you, we shd be so delighted Mother requested me to give her love & tell you so.  I suppose whether you remember'd our agreement for last night.  I did & thought about it too.  I suppose Julia is in Reading.  Please give a great deal of love to Uncle Henry & Aunt Rachel, Cos Frank & Cos Anna, Cos Thos & Cos Elizabeth & all the rest of the cousins, to Grfather of course & every body else to whom thee sees fit.  Of course thee will write to me [very] soon.  I am at the end of my paper & must conclude, thy affectionate Cos Clementine CopePS. I gave such a dismal acct of our proceedings up here that I am afraid it will not be any encouragement to come, but let me tell thee that things ai'nt always at such a forlorn pass, it only happened to be so at that particular time.
The children send their love & desire me to thank Cos Frank for the books with wh. they were very much pleased.

Dear Frank

I enclose the statement of   your fitness for holding a license. You have also I believe   to file a bond signed by two residents of the county (your   mother I suppose would do for one) which is only forfeited   in case you shoot for miliners or something of that kind   which of course you won’t do. The blank bond form can be   obtained at the [Bothonotary’s?] office I think. The only   cost is $1 per year for your license. The bond & certificate   need not be renewed every year

We are just getting   overhe worst of that museum “moving” that I spoke of & I am glad   of it, for it has been hard work for this time of   year.

I am delighted to hear of your additions to the   list. The Prairie Horned Lark I always thought would turn up   in your vicinity.

Stew Brown found the Wilson’s   Thrush at Tannersville Pocono Mts. & was as much taken aback   by the notes as I was, but as he had Mr Eugene P. Bicknell   of N.Y. in the party, he had no trouble in ascertaining who   the songster was

With kind regards to your family I   remain sincerely yours

Dear Frank

Among the   many sins of omission & commission with which my Conscience   has been burdened of late – none has laid harder on my   stomach to speak in a physiological metap[h]or than my not   having answered [thine] epistle of – mo. – 1840.  This sheet   then intended as a peace offering and mediator for past   offences “by-gones” comes to thee by the hands of Geo. H.   Dunbar – (a young man of our religious denomination-   somewhat diligent attender of meeting – (where He in company   with the majority of our young men occupies the seat   fronting the women friends – pardon the digression but the   fact is worth recording that as the Mahometan prays with his   face towards Mecca – thou canst draw the parallel) not so   much distinguished as would be best for plainness of speech.   [behavi] and apparel – and inheriting with the rest of us   some failings I fear from Father Adam - ) who is to pass   thro Philada. on his way to Haverford and then to France in   a New Lock Haven packet next week. – A poet moreover and   somewhat unique personage. & can either roar like a lion or   a sucking dove at his pleasure – rhyme to the moon or swear   like a pirate. – I don’t know how long he stays in Philada.   but if you fall in with him you’ll know him.

The   greatest attraction in these parts this winter - & which   must take its share of the blame of having kept me from   attending to my Philada correspondence is a new periodical   entitled “L’Entreprise” which has originated among us and   has claimed a goodly portion of my leisure
The great   charm about you must know is that we have Lady contributors   – Gertrude Hussey “Murray” quondam –
with sundry & divers others – too tedious to mention as the   advertisements would say – with a respectable lot of   Quak[er] lady make considerable of a coterie. – 
Dr Hardy   undertook to join but whether he did not succeed [to] his   mind or whether his practice is too extensive & laborious to   admit of his wasting his time so idly I know not – but he   has not yet contributed – This much however must be said of   him whether through his intrinsic merits or accidental   circumstances he has in fact succeeded in getting into an   extraordinary practice and seems likely to settle down here   and live easy. – Ah!  Francis if I were only as goodlooking   a young man as thou art I should then think that Destiny had   cut me (too) out for a Doctor
Ben Hardy’s whiskers were   always irresistible – but a new bobwig which I find I had   the honor of bringing home from Philada. in one of those   boxes you remember – that new bobwig with the [portage] of   which I was so unconsciously honored – that new bobwig is   worth a thousand dollars a year to him – 

The old   gentleman that was at our house a little while since from   Salem – gave us a few particulars in Ben’s history that will   be useful to any one who shall hearafter have the honor of   compiling his biography – It seems that such was his   enterprise and such too his earnest zeal in the laudable   task of pleasing the women even in early life that after   having studied the art of Crispin in his nativevillage of Kennebunk he was at the pains of a journey and   long residence at Lyme to be initiated into the art &   mystery of making woman’s shoes

How instructive the   lesson that such heroism and model-gallantry teaches –   Frank! that mans life is a lesson to all posterity – Raised   very probably on a [shingle] in that bleak [-egion]   described so emphatically by the poet – 
“Away down East   dere
[Clow] [by] de moon”
then as he grew up from   [clouts] to petticoats from petticoats to breeches to trace   the ardent aspirations of a full soul. – panting after   greatness and distinction. – from the time he first drove a   peg to the time when he last [drove] a peg – still his   potentialities are visible [from] germ to perfection and   full maturity of cobblerhood. – Ah!  if I were only   good=looking enough!
One sin of commission too I must   confess & be shrived of – As I was turning over some old   papers of mine the other day – I accidentally opened an old   letter of thine containing “a Serenade” [which] being   forthwith tempted by the Devil I inserted in a forthcoming   no. of my periodical – Now I am of opinion that the   temptation proceeds from that source because unintentionally   I find I have eclipsed myself altogether I having “done the   poetry” in that [line] till now finding that I shall not be   able to write anything as good myself why “Othello’s   occupation gone”. – 
and I shall be obliged to cultivate a little taste & genius   which I flatter myself I possess [as] “dea[t]h is [shocking]   accident – and suicide Songster.” – By the way I have begun   a pastoral

“Jocund lambkins softly warble” which when   finished shall be forwarded for your criticism and another –   
[Thus] fair brow thoughts richest mine
When thy   bright as diamonds shine
Rivalled only by the glow
of   the bright orbs below – there’s a [touch] for you –   

Remember you dont pay any postage for this letter   
So it is no matter if it is not worth anything
very   sincerely yours

My Dear Annie

I have   been very sorry to see day after day passing away without   any acknowledgment sent of thy very interesting &  welcome   lettter, which was a real treat to me. I wish there was some   hope of thy getting as good a one in reply but what with   colds & headache the little wit I ever had seems to have   departed, for which loss I console with my corespondents   every time one of my stupid effusions goes to the Post   Office.- I think a visit from thee & Clemmy would have an   enlivening effect & when summer comes so must you.- It was   very kind to send me that excellent Photo of Uncle Daniel,   after my negligence in the
matter of which I have been duly ashamed- and I am very much   obliged for it.- We had a nice visit to him had we not? If I   had not gone then, I fear I should not have seen him at all-   except that we did meet in the cars the other day- as being   sick in Wilmington entirely spoiled my Germantown visit. so   that I could make none of the calls I hoped to.-
How thee   must have enjoyed having Clemmy so long with thee. You had   splendid times I know. Indeed no one can be at your house   without enjoying themselves- At least that is my   experience.-
Thee knows perhaps that I have been a good   deal with my friend Lizzie Howell this winter.- Her mothers   death was so very sudden- only sickda little more that half   & hour- that the shock was fearful & Lizzie

was a long time recovering from it.- She is yet very sad-   and her brother being in poor health adds to the feeling.-   She was so sick for some weeks as rarely to get down stairs.   nervous & weak- but is now stronger & brighter & very busy   she writes me.- It is often a great blessing I think to   those in sorrow to have duties pressing upon them with must   be attended to & so the mind is diverted from its greif and   made to realize that life has yet much in store for them.   –
Did thee know our Georgie has been sent adrift from his   home into the city? We do miss him sadly- but he likes his   situation in a wholesale store in Market St, very well &    perhaps it is the right thing for him.- We hope that he may   be preserved from the temptations that summoned him.- Lizzie   has come home
for yearly meeting week.- We have been looking for aunt   Rachel Howland & her family every day but hear now they are   not coming till next week.-
Has thee been after “Trailing   Arbutus” this spring? [-] and I went the other day &  found   some pale blossoms. but very sweet.- Isnt it delightful to   hunt under the dead leaves for the delicate things- it seems   to make one feel young again fot the time.- Thee asks have I   read “Snow Bound”—Only a little of it &  have not happened   even to see it in a volume. But intend to get it soon if I   can.- The part I read was pleasant, simple &  [s-----] , -   as thee says more understandable than much of the latter day   poetry.- We have been reading “Across the Continent” and I   have indulged dreams of someday seeing the “Yosemite Valley”   if my finances get into sufficiently prosperous conditions   for such a journey.- Don’t thee 
want to go to Europe with the party that starts next month?-   It must be bery pleasant to look forward to & finer still to   experience if all things are fair & no anxieties to follow   you.- Wonder if John Wood &  Lily will go.- John says he   wants to & I guess Lily would not object.- I liked John   better than I expected to- but he is certainly neither   handsome nor dignified- but [-------] & kind hearted. I   should think.- Is’nt it a comfort Mary Ann Morris is so much   better? I cannot help hoping she will be entirely herself   again before very long.- Their house is very bright &   pleasant & I should think they might be very happy there-   This to be sure happiness is not a thing of outward   circumstances [----]Did thee remember that yesterday was the anniversary of our   dear Presidents death? Wonder where another year will find   us.- What do thy brothers think of our prospects with such a   man as Johnson at the helm.- It is a comfort that the crew   of out ship of State are so staunch & true.-
Suppose   Marry Emma Stokes passed meeting last third day- I do like   Alexander Wood very much. He seems so open & honest.- Will   they have a wedding  I wonder- or just be married & go   travelling.- I hear friends at Arch Street did not accept   Sue Farnum’s resignation. Had she violated discipline before   presenting it? The usual yearly mtg storms seems to be   brewing this evening- but I hope it wont come this.- Does   thee go in and out every day?.- Please excuse this [prosy]   sheet dear Annie & write very soon.- My love please to thy   sister E. – Very loving by thine
S S Reeve

      My dear Frank,      

      I rec'd thine & Chellie’s letters to day, when Tho's came out from town.  They also had one from Mary, and we are glad to hear of your safe arrival at Snow Shoe and very thankful I am, that you had a doctor so near at hand to extract the bone from thy throat.  I read thy letter first, and was much alarmed. before knowing what the accident thee alluded to was, but Thomas fortunately knew about it from Mary's letter & told me at once.

      attached wife Anna S. Cope.  I hope Tom is provided with warm under-clothing.  Mary sends her love & hopes you will have a good time.I hope thee has enough warm clothing, with thee, for I sh'd not be surprised of thr warmest weather is past.  We are having it delightful here at home, the thermometer 68 this morning at 8 o'clock and under 80 at noon.  This afternoon Thomas & Elizabeth Mary & I called at father's, and afterwards at Ellis Yarnall's leaving Mary at father's.  We found them all at home, and had a very pleasant visit.  Lucy Harrison is very bright & agreeable & Anne is lovely.  She told me she had written a note to Lillie, which I would send to her when it comes to hand.  She also told me she was sorry not to go to Snow Shoe with you, but they could not go to Chicago, & as their time is so limited they of course felt anxious to see as much as possible before going home.  they expect to go to Detroit from Chicagoand then on to Niagara.  They expect to leave sometime next week, and take the journey alone.  We all disapprove of them taking such a long journey by themselves, but I suppose Ellis Yarnall will find out some one to look after them.  When they go on, they expect to spend the first night at Altoona, and then travel day & night until they reach Chicago.  I have sent Lillie & Chellie some under-clothing.  2 flannel skirts, 2 under vests, 1 cloth body, 2 pairs thick stockings, 1 pair drawers, 1 [Alpaca?] skirt.  Anna & Carrie are quite well, & the former is invitee to spend tomorrow with cousin Mary [W.?] Brown's little Mary.  I did not [?] like [?]-ing her just now, but could not well decline.  I was at father's this afternoon, and they were all pretty well.  father seems stronger from the change in weather.  I saw bro. John and his boys go off this morning, and hope they had apleasant trip to Altoona.  I am glad you met with such a polite reception at Bellefonte.  I had no idea before, that there was any such spring of water, there as mentions.  63000 gallons a minute is immense.  I think you must have enjoyed the ride up the mountain very much, if the views are so beautiful.  Give my love to Lillie & Chellie, and tell them I hope they will not be put out at my sending them some warm clothing, as I am only sorry they did not send for warm dresses too, as they have nothing warm with them.  It is now bed-time and I must put by my writing; the children are enjoying Anna Hartshorne's company very much.  I hope some of you will write tho' I do not want you to tax yourselves.  I have already been much favored.  Bro Thomas intended sending sister Anne's letter, but it was not returned from Aunt Ruth's in time.  with much love to you all, ever thy

      Frank has been writing to William this morning, and has most likely advised you on all points of interest.- you probably know by this time, that we are all in a good state of health, and we hope that our sister Susan is improving, tho' she still has some head-ache.  Frank & cousin Wistar are very kind and devote themselves almost exclusively to contributing to her comfort & pleasure in every way.  F is devoted to Susan and does evey thing in his power to promote the improvement of her health, his kindness is unparalleled: everything is done for us, and we have nothing to do, but join in the pleasant plans laid out for us.- Elizy H & Susan were concluding before dinner, that they accomplished very little of any thing on account of the time occupied in changing their dresses for the different labors of the day.- About ten in the morning they prepare for bathing or rather we do when Susan does not go-
      /
      not arrive on 7th day tho' we intend to do so if possible.  the Boat did not leave until 5 o'clock this morning.  I expect the irregular lately.- with much love
      aff thy sister Anne
      Susan will accompany us to Hazard's this afternoon
      she is resting since her bath.then return about 12 o'clock.  rest, until time to away for dinner, then about 5 o'clock, a different costume must necessarily be adapted for Sailing especially when the boats, are slightly fishy & a little dirty.- then we come home about ten-time or little past, and another change must be made to appear at [---] which [---] will suffice for the evening.- but all this is done in a good hurry and I cannot say it consumes much time.- I believe I have nothing new to tell thee, and indeed, I expect it would be very puzzling to think of any such thing when Cousin Wistar is of the party, for he writes home to frequently, and describes every thing that seems with so much minuteness, that if you are favored with the perusal of his epistles, ours must seem quite commonplace; this is my conjecture, as we joke Wistar & Sue both, about writing so often.- Only to think- Sixth day evening we leave, if a storm or fog does not prevent us, and Tom has concluded to remain, and return with us last evening tho' fog was so dense that the Bay-State" did not go out, and now we have every prospect, of the same thick state of the atmosphere for this evening consequently.  it seemed hardly worth while for Tom to leave before we did.- The Massachusetts arrived here with Mr. Williams on board, about 11 o'clock thismorning having been lying off Point Judith, even since four o'clock.  Susan & Lizzie went to bathe this morning with F & Wistar leaving me at home to pass the time as I could.  Tom & Moses had gone fishing, and I was quiet enough.  Susan though it best notwithstanding your message, to try the [---] three times faithfully as the Dr directed, and I hope she will not be any worse for it, and perhaps it may strengthen her afterwards.  She says she likes it very much while in the water, but she feels pretty weak for sometime afterwards.  we think she is the best judge for what is best for her, and she does exactly what she wished in the Bathing line; Frank takes her in, giving her three waves as directed, he said the water was very warm & pleasant this morning.  I quite long to go in again but fear I shall not have an opportunity of going more than once or twice more before I leave.- It suits Elizy Hacker exactly, she feels a little tired after coming out, but it seems to brance & strenghthen her, and shee looks better I think in this little time of our [---] here.  I do hope her father will telegraph her to remain with Sue, if the letter does not arrive in time to answer it before our leave.- yester afternoon we were out Sailing in the bay, landed on one of the [dumpling?] rocks gathered some sprigs of green to press, and enjoyedthe novelty of it highly, it was really very pleasant, altho' by the time we returned, our blanket shawls were almost white with the fog.  Sailing seems to suit Susan, very well, but I think clear weather as a general thing is preferable to her.- This afternoon we think of calling at fr'd Hazard’s, we spent a pleasant evening there last Sixth day.  they are certainly a delightful family. Ann[a/e?] Hazard called here this morning with S & A Jenkins who are still staying with them – we intend riding out to see fr'd Jenkins before we go.- 4th day morn.  I was obliged to leave this shut hastily yesterday afternoon, as Thomas Hazard & his wife called upon us inviting us to spend this afternoon with them which we intend doing.  Elizy & Frank are much disappointed I believe in Fanny H’s beauty, but they must see her at [---] before they fully decide.  She is perfect at home.- my love to all- Susan and Lizzie are taking a nap before dinner, and I cannot disturb them now.- there is a thick fog over they bay now 12 at noon, and it will [---] increase- Tom could not have gone last night in consequence of the bay as the boat did not leave, and perhaps it is as well for him to wait for us.  Frank & myself do not think it proper to leave here in a fog or storm and Tom must not think it strange if we do

[Letter from Anna S. Cope to her sister in law R.Anna Cope]
   
   Awbury 7 mo. 9th / 58
   
   Dear sister Anna
   
   Thee will think I am very remiss in performing my promises but it is useless for me to make excuses, as thee knows how time goes with me, generally, amongst the childrenm during the day, and by evening thee may imagine how it is that I feel too indolent to write a letter.  We are much obliged to father for his kind & sympathetic letter at this time and I hope we may be enabled to take the right view of our troubles, in this matter.  Much love to father and mother, and tell them that Francis keeps up his spirits very well, considering all things, he has received a letter from bro' Thomas to day, with Geo. M. Dallas reply to his (Tho's) epistle, which he hasprobably sent to Atlantic City for father's perusal.- it is short, very politely worded, and caps the climax for coolness, on the subject, as he had evidently not troubled himself about the affair in the slightest degree.- I must confess, I was completely taken aback at such cool indifference on the subject, especially as Thomas had consulted him before, when in England.  But I suppose there is nothing more to be done about it, and we must try to hear it with a Christian spirit as father does.-
   Elizy sends her love to you all & is in better spirits, than lately, as she has received several letters from Thomas, he is still in Brussels, and appears to have no very definite idea when he may return home.-
   We are glad father has sent for Julia to join you, as she needs a change, I fear she confines too lately to the attic, and a little of your refreshing sea-breezes will revive her.  I think she has been concerned about George, as he hasbeen quite indisposed.  He is now much better and spent this afternoon here for the first time, as the Dr. thought the ride might do him good, but unfortunately he did not see much of Julia, she having been in town, and did not reach home until near seven o'clock when he was obliged to go home to tea.  He says the Dr. pronounced his lungs quite clear now, and I hope he will be able to accompany Julia to the shore.- Hannah Stokes has been here to day, and intends staying over-night, it is quite cheering to have a little company as we miss you all so much.  Thy letter this afternoon was very acceptable, and tell Clemmy I thought perhaps she would have favored us again.  I am glad to hear of the Doctor having slept better and hope he may be benefitted, my love to sister Mary, and mention to her if thee pleases, that I have not received any reply to my letter to her, but suppose I am to get a bonnet for her at Jones' according to my best judgment.  but they think it is very doubtful if they can procure any other quality of [---].  it is not as fine as thatof which our sun-bonnets are made.  Elizy Hacker expected to have gone down to Atlantic City this week, but was not well enough.-
   Brother John has been here a few minutes this evening, Rueben is not entirely well of the poison yet, and they think he has the whooping-cough.  Our Willy has it now, also little Johnny & little Mary has it quite badly.-
   Our Tom is getting better of it, and Alfred does not cough now at all; Henry still coughs a good deal at night, as well as little Johnny.-
   Mary Mayer has arrived in the city of P- and will come down here tomorrow afternoon.  How does sister Mary enjoy herself, and has she returned to bathe?  Tell Clemmy I was not surprised to hear her opinion that it is not equal to Newport.  Sarah Biddle mentioned to us on first day last, of their having received letters from uncle Alfred and aunt Rebecca- and uncle Alfred is much better, thinks the hydropathic system suits him.  Bishop Potter’s family are still with them.  Thee does not know, how much I wished she had offered to show usthe letters, as she said they were long, and very interesting.
   It is past ten o'clock, and F- is shutting up the house affectionately thy sister
   Anna

   My dear sister
   
   When I last wrote, it seemed so doubtful whether thee would be at uncle William's or on the way home with Edward Biddle, that I concluded to direct the letter to Clemmy in case thee had left there.- Brother Thomas returned home very unexpectedly on second day evening, the very time we were looking for thee, he was much overcome by the voyage, and the anxiety of getting off in a steamer, but I hope is better now,and likely to improve; his strength has been much prostrated, and he has had some fever but the Doctor considers him better this evening, and he does really seem better, tho’ he is still quite weak.  They had a very cold voyage, and he could not keep warm enough & consequently took a severe cold, but thee must not be anxious or uneasy about him, as Dr Rhoads thinks him much better; &he is entirely free of fever this evening.  Alfred is also much better to day for the first time, but he has changed so frequently from better to worse in the course of twenty four hours, that we hardly know how to calculate about him.  But I think the Doctor is more encouraged about him this evening, and I have great hopes that he will soon be on the well list, as he has one tooth through, and he has not coughed quite so hard to day; the rest of the family are all pretty well, father, and mother desire their love to thee, and say thee had better take the first good opportunity to return home, and not to think of coming home alone, without hearing further from us; and Francis also adds that in case Alfred continues better, perhaps he can come up for the next week.-
   With regard to thy medicine, and salve, we will endeavor to send it to thee in some way, as well as the material for aunt Susan’s duster.- Bro' Thomas has bough various little articles for the children, with which they are much pleased; he bought Lilly & Chelly eacha suit of doll’s clothes made in Paris, according to the present style, hats shoes, and even night-gown and cap.  velvet [---] watch & chain, little [---] all furnished in the most minute style, [---], &c little beauties,- the children are so overjoyed, that they show them to everyone that comes, and do not get tired of examining them, at all times in the day, and I do not wonder for they are so elegantly made that you cannot help admiring them.  Sister Elizy and Julia sed their love to Clemmy and thyself, in which I wish to join, also love to Aunt Susan, Annette & Carry- I am sorry I have no news to tell thee, such as thee would like to hear, but as I have not been any where for the last three or four weeks thee must not wonder at it.-
   with much love affectionately

   I am obliged to close this in haste, as it is late, and the family have mostly retired
   mother is about as well as usual now.-Tom continues to get better- whether I get up for thee or not will depend on how Alfred is.  He is a good deal better this morning.  I have Aunt Susans cloth which if I do not bring up I will send by envelope.  There seems to be no use of sending thy medicine as thee will hardly have a chance to use it, but I will bring it with me if I come. Dr Evans is not in town now

   When I last wrote, it seemed so doubtful whether thee would be at uncle William's or on the way home with Edward Biddle, that I concluded to direct the letter to Clemmy in case thee had left there.- Brother Thomas returned home very unexpectedly on second day evening, the very time we were looking for thee, he was much overcome by the voyage, and the anxiety of getting off in a steamer, but I hope is better now,and likely to improve; his strength has been much prostrated, and he has had some fever but the Doctor considers him better this evening, and he does really seem better, tho’ he is still quite weak.  They had a very cold voyage, and he could not keep warm enough & consequently took a severe cold, but thee must not be anxious or uneasy about him, as Dr Rhoads thinks him much better; &he is entirely free of fever this evening.  Alfred is also much better to day for the first time, but he has changed so frequently from better to worse in the course of twenty four hours, that we hardly know how to calculate about him.

Awbury 8 mo 14th 1859
   
   Dear mother
   
   I wrote a few hasty lines to Frank this afternoon which brother Thomas did not succeed in sending to you, as the Germantown post-office he found was not open on First-day, giving you the good news that sister E. has another boy, a very fine-looking child, and the tenth grandson, but as yet without a name, which is not decided upon, indeed, I have not heard one suggestion, only it is to be a fancy name, and Lizzie leaves it to bro' Thomas select.  Sister E. desires her love, and wishes me to say to thee, that she is very comfortable, this evening; and the Doctor says she is doing as well as is possible.  The child was born at 1/2 past 7 o'clock this morning, and the nurse came about 9.  Thomas sent to town for her early, and she came as soon as shecould, but it did not make any difference as the Doctor thought Mary Sixsmith was entirely competent to attent to all that was needed, and she proved so.
   Bro’ Thomas took Harry, Tom & Willy to meeting, and afternoon left our two boys at father’s to dine, and went for them to return home towards evening.  The house seems quite lonely and deserted now, and company at the tea-table was very slim this evening, only three, Thomas, Harry & myself.
   Ellie Stokes with little Ellie left for Riverton yesterday afternoon.  Ellie ad been staying with us since 6th day morning.
   Sister Susan and Virginia also went home yesterday afternoon, they enjoyed their visit with us very much, and it was very pleasant to us to have them, as we miss you all so much.   The children have kept pretty well, tho' yesterday was an oppressively warm day here, so damp & close, but to day it is lovely, tho' quite warm.-
   I hope you are all enjoying the sea-breezes notwithstanding the hard beds, which must be quite a draw-back to thecomfort of some of you.  How is Anne?  Sister Lizzie wished me to mention, that she hopes Anne will drink plenty of [---] wine as it was particularly recommended to Clemmie by Dr. [Meigs?], at one time as being very beneficial, as it has the peculiar quality of enriching the blood, and he ordered her to take a tumbler full a day.  Lizzie thinks Frank had better take some more of it to Atlantic City for her on 4th day, when he comes up.  Please give my love to her, also to father, Emma, and sister Lizzie Brown.  Dr Rhoads mentioned this morning that Margaret Eliz expected to go to the sea-shore tomorrow in company with Augustus Wilson, and some one else whose name I did not quite understand.  I hope you may meet with her.-   
   affectionately thy daughter

My dear Chellie

As Dr Rhoads very kindly offered to take this note to thee, I thought perhaps thee would like to hear how thy little brothers are getting along at home and therefore take the opportunity to send a few hasty lines.  Alfred was very happy in a few minutes after papa and Willy & Tom left us; I went to ride with uncle Thomas the latter part of the afternoon, and took him along, we had a few errands to do in Germantown.-
Uncle Alfred & Aunt Rebecca Cope with Annie, called to see us yesterday afternoon and we had a very pleasant visit from them.  Uncle Alfred's knee is still rather troublesome, but his foot is better.  Cousin Edward is going to the WhiteMountains with uncle Edward Yarnall & Aunt Caroline, very soon.  Tell Aunt Lizzie that I saw grandma Brown at meeting this morning, she told me they were all pretty well except Ridgely and he was threatened with [cramp?] last night, but was much better to day, indeed quite relieved; they sent for Dr Rhoads who saw him again this morning before grandma came to meeting.  Tell papa that wonders will never cease, Aunt Mary Haines & mamma are going to spend this evening with Ann Haines to meet B Yarnall's family.-

in great haste

Title: 1875 July 4, Lake Windermere, to Tom & Scrubby

Lockwood Hotel   Lake Windermere
   July 4. 1875
   
   Dear Tom & Scrubby.
   
   I did write a few lones to thee Scrubby from Kendal but I rec'd such a nice letter from thee last Fifth day that I concluded to send thee a longer one; & as I have already rec'd two letters from Tom I thought it would be well to kill two birds with one stone-so here goes-We saw the first of this lake last Fourth day afternoonand will continue to see it till sometime tomorrow.  I haven't the slightest idea where the picture, at the head of this sheet, is taken from;- but I know one thing & that is that I have not as yet seen anything like it nor do I think that there is such a view.  At any rate it gives you no idea of the place.  Now for the narrative- We took a row on the lake soon after arriving here & on Fifth day took the steamer down to [Bowness?] where we expected to get on a carriage & drive over to Coniston.  When we arrived there, however, the sky looked so threatening & Alexis not feeling very well we concluded to leave it till next day, & returned to Louwood.  Arriving in a heavy shower we were at a loss to know what to do, till I decided to go over to Keswick & get our letters that were probably awaiting our arrival there.  So as the stage did not go till 3 o'clock I drove over to Ambleside, bought a full rubbersuit (coat leggings & cap) hired a horse & started off, about 1 o'clock.  You can imagine me clothed in these things sitting on an awfully rough trotter nothing of my usual self being visible except my eyes, nose & mouth, and my shoes.  The suit answered admirably, keeping me perfectly dry in the hardest thunder-storm I was ever out in- Except my shoes wh. in a few minutes were rather soggy.  However it was soon over & I arrived at [Derwentwater?] Hotel, [Portinscale?] at 4 P.M. having ridden on horseback 19 miles.  Here I obtained, first a lunch then the letters, one from each of you.  While waiting here another gust came up & when it had gone over the sky looked brighter & more settled.  So having engaged rooms for 2nd day, at 6 P.M. I set off & had a most beautiful ride past [Thirlmue?] & Helvellyn, Grasmere & Rydal Water back to Ambleside wh. I reached at half past eight.  Drove downto our hotel, took some red-hot tea & then went out to hunt for Lilly & Alexis, whom I found spooning in a bench & who told me that there were three other pairs in the hotel worse off than we were.  Sixth-day we set off for Coniston Water, driving alongside of Windermere & crossing below Bowness, through Hawkshead where Wordsworth went to school & finally reached Coniston where Lillie & I made the tour of the lake in the steam Gondolee as they call it while Alexis ascended the "Old Man."  We had the best of it for, although he immortalized himself by leaving his name & address in full on top of pole of stones which has been placed there, yet he was caught in such a dense fogthat he couldn't see anything & in turn caught a species of chill & fever, from which he is slowly recovering.  Yetserday we went through Grasmere & Rydal & got Lillie pretty well played out.  We rowed down Grasmere Lake & walked to Rydal Mount, (wh we did not see, exceptone window & the chimney's) Lillie & Alexis "preferring rather" to keep on a level while I crossed over the hill from wh. I got an elegant view of Windermere, Rydal Water, Grasmere & [Tharlmere?] besides some small 'towns' and the mountains on all sides.  On coming down I overtook Lou & Alexis spooning by the roadside, On my coming up they had began to talkpleasantly about the weather, Lillie suggesting that it was much cooler than the 3rd of July 2 years ago, at wh. both looked remarkably pleased & mysterious.  I looked very innocent but on making "comparative mathematical calculations" have concluded that it must have been that day they drove over from Connymeade together & took two hours & a half (2 ½ hrs) by the watch to get up to the house from the stable-   

   It’s fearfully hard to get Lillie up in the mornings.  She grumbles incessently because Alexis & myself will order breakfast at half past eight & uses as anargument to the statement, (I wont say in fact) that Father when he was over here did not breakfast till nine.  Another instance, Tom of the force of example.  However we dont give in & in revenge she gener-ally keeps us waiting 15 or 20 minutes.  Alexis thinks it is a good thing that we travel from place to place, as they must think wherever we go that it is a mere accident that we are late.  This miserable climate dont seem to suit me very well.  In the first place the voyage knocked me, clean; for I caught cold some how wh. increased my sore-throat & I haven’t got rid of it yet.  It steadily increased till I got to Warwick wh place seemed to agree with it; for it has been improving since.  Then I had a boil on my skin which troubled me not a little when I ran against anything or Alexis hit me with his umbrella.  I have got it down to a pretty fine point now however & one is coming on my backjust between my shoulders so as to afford me an opportunity of displaying my skill in twisting my arms around.  Beer dont seem to be the thing for me at present, & I have hardly tasted it since leaving Liverpool.  As to the roast-beef, it tastes very much like the same article at home, and they put so much mint with the peas to make them green I suppose that you cant taste any thing else.  But the great charm is that every thing is so nice & clean- no greasy knives &c  You must excuse this writing; but Lillie brought us out here on a most uncomfortable hill-side & insists on sticking it out.  We saw some very pretty little ponies when we were in Wales Srubby; but as we are carrying very small valises & they are pretty full we thought best to defer our purchasefor a season.  I commenced writing on this sheet as you may see but Lou thought it was so important to write on pictured paper that I gave in- Consequently the above marks- I hope that Hazen may succeed in getting up his party & also that he will not ruin the horses driving too much in the park.  I have just thought of a little map wh. I have in my packet wh. I shall enclose in this letter with 5th and 6th sdays excursions marked on them.  Although it may not interest either of you I think mother will like to see it.  I will now cook as it is time for me to be poking Lillie up to go down to dinner,

Cannes Feb. 8. 1880.
   
   Dear Alexis,
   
   We recd thy letter of Jan. 16th a few days since, & have been thinking over thy proposition.  It wd. be nice to be able to spend part of our summers in Susquehanna Co particularly if you make it your home, but we have not been looking forwarrd to keeping house in our return.  I do not want to live at Connymead again, (indeed I do not think any of us want to; unless we cd. find some one to live with us)  It was too lonely, particularly for me.  & if we did not keep house there in winter, we cd. not keep very well keep house in summer.  How or where we shall live when we go home, I do not know.  Indeed the uncertainties of the future, & what it will be best to do, often weighs upon my mind.  Connymead is no placefor any body to live who wants to be a Friend, or who has any preference for their ways.  Life there was a continual struggle wh. I have no desire to renew, & perhaps we shall never know again [ever/even?] that semblance of a home.  I hope if thee and Lily picked to bring your children up as Friends, you may be able to keep them in a community where Friends live.  For it is pretty hard for a young person who has been uninstructed in what are considered the accomplishments of life to have to live where these are considered all important, & are the chief recupations of those by whom you are surrounded.  It requires a good deal of strength of character to be able to live alone, I [---], & Friends must always do it more or less when they go out from among their own people.  When one has not been brought to play on the piano or sing or draw, or paint, or evento play cards- a not very valuable accomplishment certainly- & yet one in wh. English people who are both intelligent & sensible, seem to while away at least a fourth part of their waking hours; & never to tire of- When I say, one has never been instructed in any of these things, one feels as if one ought to be at least where they are not the chief employment of life.  Of course when living in a delightful pension on the Riviera- one is not supposed to be exactly fulfilling the normal conditions of existence- Existence here (the physical part of it) seems too delightful to be long continued, & I have wonder since we have been here how long 14 human beings could live together, without apparently a shadow of sorrow or anxiety to disturb the delightful days, which seem, to glide away without a cloud either inward or outward, to mar their peacefulness such skies, & such weather , & such walks as we have- only one littleshower in all the two months we have been here- It is the most perfect thing in weather certainly, that we have ever experienced.  If we had come last winter we shd  not have had the same experience of it, for it rained very much even here.  But I have digressed widely from the subject upon wh. I intended to write, [---] the old house of Woodbourne.  Whatever may be my inclincation with regard to it, (& I certainly shd. like very much the idea of being able to live somewhere near you).  I do not thonk C & A have any desire to undertake housekeeping there.  The life of a travelling artist- or even of the traveller, minus the artist- in these delightful regions & pensions where have all the comforts of home without its cares, does not intend to inspire you with a desire to renew the contest with the [biddy?]- in art less America. If only some plan cd. be devised by wh. Woodbourne cd. be converted into a pension.  I have no doubt we shd. spend a good deal of our time there, & shd. think the old house wd. need an immense amount of repairing, & as to the old chairs of the Conklin family, I feel as if I had lost my interest in them & I shd. not think they wd. be worth the sum they mentioned.  It is provoking to have to buy what is your own.  (see 4th page of A's letter)Can thee tell us who paid the drivers on our Naples [---] wh. were packed in the same box with P.C.G.'s- we asked thee to do it & I suppose thee must have- but we have never heard.If not paid
   
   Please pay to the order of Francis C. Haines (who may be too modest to speak of it) 9 francs 15 centimes, as near as you can come at it.

Title: 1880 March 21, Hotel de la Paix, Rome, to Lily

March. 21. 1880.
   
   My dear Lily, Behold us in Rome once more!- dear delightful bewitching Rome- The city of cities- I cannot tell with what delight I find myself again threading its labyrinths & wandering amidst its ruins.  We reached here the 6th of March, having left Mentone 2 days before, passing one night in Genoa & thence by the midnight train to Rome.  This being the only train (owing to their very insane & uncomfortable arrangements) wh. gets you here at a respectable hour.  It was a very uncomfortable journey- but then we were coming to- Rome!!  We made a sojourn of two weeks only, at Dr. Müllers- Mentone we thought lovely- Dr M’s house not altogether so.  It is not happily [---] being at the end of one of thos dried up rivers, down wh. torrents of cold airrushed from the mountains.  We thought it much colder & damper than either Cannes or Nice.  & then there was a slight suggestion of boarding school about the household arrangements- & most for much open warfare between the Dr & his spouse to be altogether agreeable.  It is a great pity they have not learned to control their tempers a little in the presence of their guests at least- for at times it was rather to peppery to be pleasant.  Fortunately the storms seemed to be not very lasting.  & they were generally jolly enough- & in fact much more jolly then most people would be who were at their wits ends to make two ends meet.  A lady who was staying there with her family (pretty much as a matter of charity I fancy) told me they were over head & ears in debt & that she had come to the conclusion there was no use in trying to help them, as they never cd. keep any money- altho' they ask a very high price for their accomodations.  The excursions at Mentone were truly lovely, & the Dr. was alwaysready to take us.  In fact we thought he quite preferred the ladies to the boys for he seemed quite put out once or twice at our declining to go.  but they were too hard for me, & I did none of the very long ones.  I shd. think however for those who were up to that sort of thing, Mentone would be one of the most delightful of the Riviera towns, tho' each one of them seems to have its own peculiar charms.  The weather was very warm when we got to Rome, & took the back bone out of me terribly- It however soon changed from mild, to cool, clear & bracing & the last 10 days have been delicious- I never was able to do so much walking in Rome before, & on spring afternoons such as these what luxury cd. be greater than to drive or to wander at will among the ruins all golden in the light of the declining sun- or to watch the funny old models in their gay rags & tatters- (wh. seem to [---] the spirit of the twins-) hanging themselves out on the Spanish Steps to be admiredwith all the rest.  Surely there is no place on earth like Rome.  Last first day was the kings birthday & there was a grand review- & the king & queen & the [---] kindly [---] themselves , to our admiring gaze in the Borghese. It was quite too gay & disappointing to be proper for 1st day.  The usual ceremonies of holy week begin to day, wh. is Palm Sunday.  We did not attend at S. Peters, thinking last year it was rather a sell.  I went to the little Italian [Waldensian] Church, a great contrast indeed to the pomp & [---] of the great Cathedral.  We had got back to our old Hotel della Pace, where we were twice last winter.  We went first to another but did not like it, & so came here, where we found some friends of last summer (the Müllers).  It is a good central situation.  We look down upon the Piazza Barberinni & the old Tritan who is always blowing his stream of water into the air, & then catching it again all over his head & back wh. must be pretty well washed in all the years that it has been trickling over him.  Then on the other side of the street2
   
   is the Barberrini Pal.  & sad eyed Beatrice.  By way of variety the other day we went to one of Miss Brewsters receptions.  It was a kind of afternoon tea fight, of [---] & other distinguished persons like ourselves.  Tea, wine, & talk & many beautiful things to look at.   

   Next, we want to go with her.  Forbes the archaeologist to hear tge Forum explained on the latest authorities.  His explanations one said to be intensely interesting.  In fact Rome is so dissipating- there is such an infinity to see & to read & to learn that it is most distracting.  I hope we shall be here three or four weeks longer at least.  In fact it spoils you so for every thing else that it does’nt seem worth while to go any where afterwards.
   
   I ought to have told thee before, how glad I was to get thine & Agnes' letter at Mentone.  I was greatly struck with the advance of the latter's ideas since her first epistle wh. I have carried ever since, in the pocket of my satchel& wh. was composed mostly of kisses.  I see she is now advancing to the doll & the baby house interests of the little girl-hood.  The way the ideas were put together was very amusing- & the circumstantial acct. of the flight of the nurses & the changing reigns of the lady’s of the nursery very graphic.  Give her a kiss, & tell her Auntie has very much obliged for her letter & thought it very interesting.  Also that she must’not cut any more holes in her apron with her little scissors, but must make some nice little paper dresses for the paper dollys that Aunty sent in the letter.   

   22nd.  Just returned from our excursion to the Forum with Mr Forbes- two hours rummage amoung the ruins- intensely interesting- back nearly broken- head ditto.  General conglomeration of podiums, Tabulariums, demolished temples & roman emperors- but quite worth the 4 francs wh. is the price per head at wh. Mr F. deals out his information.  He has been on the spot for some years & actually seen & superintended the excavations- so of course knows a great deal about it, & sees it in a very interesting way- much more so than [Hare?], who is a dreadfully guide booky old fellow I think- Am too tired to write more   

   Please tell Alexis that the letters of credit came a few days since, & we are much obliged for his attention to them.  Love to all.  Tell Cousin Anna I am going yo ans. her letter as soon as I can find time.  Thy affectionate Sister

   My dear Lily,
   
   I expect Caroline will give me "Jesse" as the saying is, if I presume to enter on the stage with her.  Nevertheless as she has occupied the floor for some weeks past in thy favor, I think I shall dare to add a note, tho' she tells me it must be short & upon no account much upon Revenna.  Wherefore conclude she has been expending herself on that ancient & delightful city- & forbear.  Thy letter of-- containing the childrens photographs came tohand two days since, & gave much pleasure.  We think thine, with little Eleanor, is the best of thee we have ever seen, & as to the little E I shd. say she was her Mama in miniature just as little F is his Papa over again only with a few shades more of jollity in his face.  What a sweet little good natur’d  happy kissable face it is & tho' I believe we have understood that he was'nt particularly fond of the latter operation, I doubtnot he has to undergo a good deal of it, & he does'nt look as if he wd. be very refractory under any circumstances, Indeed such a nice little jolly face must be a great comfort to look at, &, I need not suggest for Mamas to be proud of.  I suppose when we get home thee & Alexis will be a grand old couple, sitting up in the middle of your flock, looking very wise & experienced, as you contemplate with "majestic pride" the youthful scions growing & flourishing about you.
   
   I don’t see that thee has a very care worn air however in thy photo-graph.  but on the contrary one might suppose that they cares & worries of domestic life were quite [---] & pleasant.  by what you say I shd. think the heat must have been of that nature wh. wd. have a tendancy to drive you to seek for a cooler clime.  For my part I dont see the use of undertaking to live in such a climate at all, as the chief object of life seems to be with most people to get away from it.  Why not try to live, as I said to the Awbury people yesterday, where such fearful agonies wd. not have contin-ually to be gone thro' with in order to try to effect an escape.
   
   I am very sorry for Madjy's disappointment as her letter to us showed that he hopes were very much set on Europe, & she seems to need some change so much.  It is a great pity they have to undergo such alternations of hope & despair, because they have got [---] on the living side of the Atlantic.  At least it seems to be the side wh. is very much below par with most persons who inhabit it judging from the frantic manner in wh.they rush for the other shore.  The papers say that pretty much Ole America is now on the way to [---].  We concluded that the pleasure to be derived from seeing the play, wh. I think wd. be but doubtful at best, wd. be very much spoiled by the crowd of cooks & other tourists who will infest the country. We therefore have chosen to spend some time insteadin Geneva in French family No 2.  Not that we were disappointed with our experiences in No 1, but that we fell very much in love with this family last fall, when we took some lessons of them.  They are more cultivated people than the others- consequently moreinteresting, & tho' less well off- they are still friench, wh. means that they are practical & know how to be comfortable on a little.  We only pay about half as much as we do at the large Hotels, with more real comfort, beside the very good advantage of hearing the best of french spoken.  The lady has two sons, one a professor in the University & one a clergyman, & two dhrs. all highly educated.  The advantages of the education here for those in moderate circumastances are so very great.  We shall stay probably a month or more until the weather gets to hot wh. does'nt seem very likely- as we are on pretty high ground just outside the city with plenty of green trees & alps in profusion in the distance.
     
   My advice to you is to come & build a cottage on one of the hill sides of Geneva, instead of Woodbourne & get a Savoyard maid as we have, who with her mistresses aid does the work for a household of 9 persons.  We have two dinners daily, of several courses & very well cooked, & how in the world they do it all I cannot conceive.  I suspect that Madam is at the bottom of a good deal, but she does it all with such apparent grace & ease, that one cannot suspect her of cooking.  There are beautiful building lots to be bought here, by the way, on the high ground along the town with the Lake on one side & Mt. Blanc on the other, & there are many beautiful gardens & suburban residences- wh. are quite unseen & [---] by the mere passing traveller.  If it was’nt for those children of yours whom we want to see!- I shd. be quite tempted to invest in one of these little spots & settle down for the rest of my days.  Will thee please ask Alexis to inquire of cousin FRC if he rec'd a letter fm. me posted June 8. containing a cheque for $200.  I also posted one on the 13 June to M.S.C. containing cheque for $100.  As there is some risk of these things being lost shd. be very much obliged if A or some body wd. advertise Provident Life & Trust Company of [---] and [---]. of these two cheques payable to the order of the above mention’d persons.  Hoping soon to have news of you in a cooler clime & under Mrs. Hotchkiss' hospitable roof.  Ever thy affec- sister C.  Ever so many kisses to dear little Agnes & to theothers as for as appreciated by them.

   Thee will probably be somewhat surprised in receiving a communication from me, in reply to thine- but I have determined notwithstanding my extreme diffidence to employ pen & paper- in order- if possible to dispel some unpleasant and I may ass unhappy associations connected with thy last visit.  That I did feel and evince some repugnance to having a private conversation with thee- I freely acknowledge.  Why I did so- it is impossible for me to explain- unless it was because I supposed the one- we had previously had- was sufficient to elucidate all difficulties- and therefore a second one useless.- I regret now such a thought should have entered my mind- and why I felt it painful- to have a further explanation- when I saw it wd. afford thee a satisfaction- is a mystery I do not yet understand; but as all regrets are unavailing- I will not strengthen them by indulging in, or dwelling upon them.-  That my manners may have appeared in some instances- as they says, cold and repulsive, I am sensible- without my intending them to have that effect, at any rate- let me assure thee, it was very far from my intention, to wound or hurt thy feelings for even as I wd. like my own respected- have I endeavoured to consider thine.------ I certainly meant to imply from what I said- I considered thee in fault, in not having sent me any intimation of thy feelings with resepct to me, throughout the whole seven months of thy absense; most assuredly- absense & silence were never calculated to cherish and increase a preference, which under different- and more auspicious circumstances might have arisen; & as thee gave me no intimation I was not forgotten- I had no alternative left, but to believe as I did- thee had abandoned all idea of further intercourse- well then- considering myself slighted, and neglected, how could reserve and coldness of manner be entirely avoided?  In extending my forgiveness, I really thought I had something to forgive- but it seems- according to the light in which thee views it- there was no fault committed- and consequenlty no "need of forgiveness."  However different thy views of human nature- and the ways of the world, are from my own- I must still see those actions- in the light of errors- but will consider them as unintentional- and arising from inexperience.  With respect to our correspondence motives of delicacy alone- prevented me from consenting to it- If thee had thought correctly about it- theewd. have supposed, as our friendship & intimacy advanced those feelings- wd. have been overcome- and however great an effort I still think it wd. be- to maintain a correspondence with a gentleman even after an engagement, I should consider it a duty- an obligation, not to be dispensed with.-  I do not remember thy suggesting any other mode of intercourse between us- than the one just spoken of- at all events neither of those mentioned by thee- wd. have been very suitable, or meet with my concurrence.  I acquit myself- if thee will not do it- of all design at "flirtation & coquetry," however some of my sex may indulge in it at the expense of yours- I am very sure- I do not belong to that class of cruel coquettes- who make a boast of their conquests- & offer encouragement where none is meant.  In writing this letter- I trust I am not guilt of an improper act- I thought considering all things- it was nothing more than thy due- & in doing it- my mind which was before ill at ease- is put comparatively at rest.-  I beg thee will destroy this letter- and forget anything but friendship ever passed between us.-  I have now only to add an assurance of respect & esteem & how earnestly I wish thy happiness, thee can never know, unless thee can read the heart of thy sincere friend

   "I long have thought my absent friends, a something to have sent you,
   Tho' it should serve nae other ends, than just a kind memento."
   
   Thy letter bearing date of twenty seventh of last month- came to hand after some detention- and has determined me to set about writing immediately- as I owe it, both to my duty, and my feelings, to send a speedy reply to thy communication- containing intelligence of a nature- which astonished & vexed me not a little.  I was astonished, thee should suppose me to be the author of that document, styled by thee, the "witty letter;" and vexed, that any one should descend to such meanness- as thus to endeavour to practice upon thy credulity.  As for me, I must disclaim all knowledge or connection with it in any way- and I do not envy the person who could be guilty of such an action- any of the wit it displayed- or grammatical learning- which if I understood thee rightly it is woefully deficient in.
   
   By the bye, I am much indebted for the compliment, of having so fine a piece of wit and learning, attributed as the production of my hand and pen- at the same time I will frankly own- from some expressions in thy letter- I think the shadow of a doubt more than [---] crossed thy mind as to my being in reality, the author.
   
   And now the question is- who can have been the offenders and against whom are we to direct our honest indignation? for I assure thee I feel no small share- I have not the slightest idea who it can be and yet some one it wd. seem, who had some knowledge of the circumstances- must have had a hand in it.  I think the want of learning displayed- could only have been a part of their plan to avoid detection- and not from real ignorance of the rules of grammar.  I've a womans curiosity to see the letter, and know all about it.
whether the writing resembles mine- if 'twas dated B........ with my name appended to it; all of which enquired I hope to have answered.
   
   The says in thy letter- ro please the ladies- thee must not broach serious subjects- if thee wishes to please my ladyship- and thee has professed as much- thee may make choice of any subject- whether "sober prose, or prose run mad"- I shall not object to anything and 'tis quite a mistaken idea- that ladies are never pleased with serious subjects- notwithstanding the author of the witty letter to the contrary.- Although thee may think there is very little like sobriety, or a disposition to moralize, in my character- I think my heart can duly appreciate and respond to good sentiments, whenever it is my good fortune to meet with them.
   
   Have we not had a very delightful Autumn?  such beautiful weather for riding or walking- and yet we have not availed ourselves of the bright sunshineand pleasant air- to make any rambling excursions in the woods or along by the banks of the river- the scattered foliage is already strewn upon the pathway- and in a few short days- we shall have the bare and leafless branches- telling us of the desolation of natures beauties.  Spring has always been my favorite season- but in all its gaiety and animation- it could not spread a scene more showy or more varied than the one now before us- such a happy blending of colours- but we have no beautiful hills or fertile [---]- where nature at this season appears so prominently beautiful.  In the "far off country" which thee inhabits- there must be every variety and beauty of scene- but then the distance is such a barrier- so many hundred miles from all ones friends-  I almost wonder thee has not been tempted to move within the reach of those thee holds most dear---
   
   I am sorry thee has experienced any uneasiness onaccount of having read to me those New York letters;- since it is so- I regret thee favourd me with a sight- at the same time I feel very certain of not having betrayed the confidence reposed in me- and have not the most distant idea who the lady can be.  I think the young lady- with so many [trunks?] – must have played the coquette very skillfuly- to have secured so many offers in so short a time- she knew her power I suppose- and was determined to excersize it- at the expense of her numerous admirers- Before I close my letter I must not forget to acknowledge the receipt of two newspapers- sometime in the month of August- for which accept my thanks the tale which they contained (the title of it I forget just now) I quite admired.--  The other day I met with something which pleased me exceedingly, in one of [Lardners?] papers.- It was an essay on lovers- and described the different kinds of lovers, most admirably- I recognized more than one or two, or three of my acquaintance in the descriptions.  I wd. like them to see it.-  I must now conclude my letter- as I have already written more- than I expected to- or that can afford thee much interest in the perusal.  with [---] of    rememberance-
   I remain sincerely thy friend,

I am giving thee dear William- a proof of my sincere and unabated affection- in this early replying to thy most welcome letter of the 8th which only came to hand this morning- thee may be sure its arrival was awaited by me, with more than usual impatience- I could not believe another week wd. be suffered to elapse- without the accustomed message of love, and rememberence,- and every day I wd. say to myself well- I certainly will hear to day- but very many times have I been doomed to suffer disappointment- how however- I am relieved by the actual presence of the well known hand writing- and will thus evince my greatful feelings- in its early acknowledgement.-  Let me tell thee dear William- I think thee greatly undervalues thy epistolary talents, thy letters cannot be any thing but interesting to me- and if I acknowledge them to be so- why that,- must be as much as thee can desire- as for my own I have long since despaired of arriving at any thing like excellence in the art,- and the only and slight merit- if merit it may called- which they posess- is the spirit of affection which they [---], & which prompts me to the undertaking I have not the least partiality for the employment thee knows- and often with merely for the purpose of receiving in return.-  To day I was [---] gratified & delighted- for independent of the pleasure thine afforded me- there was one from my dear sister Caroline.  I will not tell thee what she says, now- but when thee comes- thee shall see it.- I do not know that I recollect to observation thee alludes to- as having been made by me- when last here- at least I am not certain what it was.- The will find in me as usual- a very ready and willing listener to all thee may have to communicate- I hope my presence will not prove talismanic and cause thee to forget what thee had to say- I did not find it necessary to apply to Father for information respecting the time of holding our monthly meeting- it has just passed, last week- and the next oneoccurs- on the ninth of April- The [---] is- the first fourth day after the first second day in the month.- I had a sweet little note from cousin Edith the other day- it contained an invitiation for us to come, or rather go out to make them a visit- I knew it wd. not be very pleasant just now and in my answer, declined the invitation for myself- and promised to deliver the one to thee when next we met- Edith styles thee, her "cousin elect" already.-  What an appalling spectacle the burning of the Wm Penn must have been- It will have an effect I think, to increase the fears of [---] travellers-.  How sorrowful I felt, upon learning of the death- of R.B. [Thornson?], during her life we had each of us, made attempts to become better acquainted- but were never very successful- and now in her death, I feel as if I had almost lost a dear friend- her family will feel her loss to be irreparable- I should like to have some particulars of her death- I trust it was a happy one- holding out consolation to her afflicted and berieved family-.  Dearest Wm. I must now say farewell! as it is fast-approaching [---] 6 o'clock- and I am encroaching not a little [---] the time usually devoted to the indifference of my friends [---]- with a thousand assurances of undiminished affection

   My dear friend
   Sarah Walker
   
   I little while ago Carry handed me thy letter to read- which was received today, and dated 1 mo 22d and 24th and asked if I would write to thee.  From the tenor of thy letter thee seems to think there has been an improvement is Uncle Wm's condition.  But though for a little while, since being in bed- he was able to take cream again, to some little amount, he is now very low indeed, and taking only a very little wine, about a teaspoonful at a time.  TheDr told them he might not live through last night.  I came over yesterday afternoon.  About 7 O'clk  the girls and Edgar were around his bed.  He was asking about one or two of them; and who it was at the foot of the bed?  when told it was Nettie, said he could’nt see- still I think there was but little light in the room- The remark was made that he had a good many kind children round him, I think he tried hard to say yes- but seemed unable, something like a slight spasm coming on, from that time for a while, it seemed as if he might be dying.  but he again revived, and was able to speak out quite loud during the night.  calling outhis wishes he does not seem able to modulate his voice.  He is very childlike and dependant upon those around him.  How frail we are truly!  Human nature seems to be utter weakness at such times.  He  has been generally & uncomplaining during his sickness, although within a day or two there has been some moaning, apparently from weakness he dont speak as if he suffers much.  He seems very appreciative of the attention of his friends.  I do not think any of them now look for his recovery.  And from present appearances, it does not seem likely the end is very far off and yet I feel as if it was hard to know how long it may be.  He is very very sick looking now.  By dear aunt Susans removal, pooruncle Wm seems of course more thrown upon his children, And it is indeed pleasant to see their kindness & attention.  dear Clemmie especially, [*] but perhaps I should not draw any comparison, but she is the oldest and has felt perhaps more responsibility, especially before her father was confined to bed, and others had stepped in to assist.  The girls seem pretty well and much composed.  Nettie is suffering with headache to day.  and Clemmie was a day or two ago.  Edgar does not look very well to me but he was up a good deal last night.  Alexis seems very well.  Of course thee knows the girls have been passing through a great deal.  but I hope the Lord has been near may an eternal inheritance be granted uncle Wm if he is taken
   
   *more striking with Clemmie than Carry & Nettie, because of her former shrinkingClemmie seemed much distressed and unnerved last evening, when her father seemed to be reviving again, and she had been in hopes it was almost over.  His groaning was distressing  to her.  but I do not know that he was suffering so much.  If it was suffering, I should suppose it was from weakness and distress.  Cousin Frank and Mary Yarnall have been very kind and attentive.  We are expecting brother Thos out to night.  I will now close this biding thee farewell.  I fear this is a very different letter from what it might have been had one of the girls written it.*  Affectionately thy friend

   My dear Alexis & Lillie
   
   Shall your tardy Aunt Anne try to write you a bit of a letter from this substantial land perhaps to meet you in the land of antiquity, art, and beauty.  I cannot describe Pompeii, I cannot say I have been where Paul landed so long, long ago.  Yet give me the land of protestant vigorous American for my home, before stale Itily [sic]!  do you think that very unappreciative?  Do not suppose I think there is nothing of interest there.  There seems to me much of the spirit of this world which you may see when abroad, more than in our more practical land.
   
   Let me tell you I have thought of you and have been looking towards writing sometime.  I [---] say how gratifying it was toreceive  the little card remembrance sent from Mentone long since to me, I have been long in acknowledging it, but it was truly acceptable to Aunty  I have an idea I sent a message about it lately in some one elses letter.  As my own writing had been and seemed to be a poor dependance I had a short attack of sickness lately,- though I have not been very mighty for some time- and Dr Darrah suggested my going to the shore, but I prefered coming here.  I have Mary Creeth with me, she is pleasant company.  And I am glad to have the opportunity of hearing about dear uncle Alfred.  She seems to have thought very much of him.  The old home as it was with its inmates will be forever gone when you return- if so permitted- We know all is so uncertain.  What a wipingout!  James and Louise left for Oxford last 7th day week.  Mary Creeth thinks James much improved.  And we may hope his good traits will appear to his advantage.  He took articles of clothing with him belonging to his parents and one or two articles which he took of his fathers I was glad to hear of; it seemed to show an affectionate feeling connected with the old association.  Perhaps you heard that Philip and Lillie Garrett expect to take Fairfield this summer.  And John Biddle take Philip's house in Germantown this summer after it is vacated.I find it does not well answer to write on both sides of my paper so take another sheet.
   
   The streams are so beautiful this time we have been here, so much water & charmingly clear.  We have driven several times.  And I hope we are both gaining.  Has mother told you of the prospect of my keeping house at Atlantic City this summer?  With Jane Taylor for housekeeper.  If I get there I hope some of the family may feel it attractive enough to accept hopsitality under my roof.  The house is a private one, on the Avenue next above the beacth & between the Surf House and Denis' Cottage.  It has three rooms on each floor, and backs towards the ocean, with not as open a view of the rolling deep as I could desire.  What will be the result remains to be known.  Whether we get establishedand if so, how things will turn out?  I may not be there all the time even though I should be the back bone of The Rest by the sea.  Now my foreign relations dont feel too saucy about this sandy place.  I know it is not Mentone or the Bay of Naples.  But indeed I wish it had some rocks for the waves to dash over, and some greenness to add its beauty.
   
   St. Cloud Hotel Phila [---] I came direct to this place from the Water Gap and my own dear Lillie thy own nice letter to me came to my hand here.   I was glad I already commenced a letter to thee before thine arrived that I might be credited for my intention or wish to write whether there was any letter or not for me.  The Yearly Meeting opened yesterday, but I did not leave the Water Gap in time to attend the first sitting.  I arrived last evening & Madgiemet me here and stayed with me that night.  It is less exertion to remain in the city if you attend the meeting.
   
   19th The date of my letter will be rather old but perhaps it will make little difference to you.  Ellie came to stay with me tonight and George took tea with us, they have gone to call at George's uncle's.  Brother T. and sister E. Madgie and Clemmie dined with me to day also.  Mary expects to come tomorrow.  Poor Madgie is again troubled with her eye.  it looks very badly and it seems to be a serious affection which she is subject to.  Dr Norris allows her to go out though.  Anthony K. created an excitement in meeting to day, in persevering in reading a chapter in the Bible, suffering no indifference of friends to stop him said he had got the book 3 years ago with the intention of reading the chapter in meeting.  saying hethought he now had the strength to read it and expected to read it through, which I understood he did  I forget the chapter, but understood it was a prophecy against the unfaithful shepherds.  No one seconded him in this thing, at any rate not in meeting and I heard they afterwards had one of the best meetings they had had at all.  It is time for me to prepare for bed, I will bid you an affectionate farewell.  Give my love to Alfred.  And with love to you your affectionately interested

   From thy letter of yesterday I perceive that doubts still exist as to the apprehended piracy- & the papers which reach us are full of contradictions & vain conjectures- at one time we were assured that the informtation had reached Norfolk about the same time it reached N Castle- & after that statement had passed current for some days we find by a Balte. paper that the first knowledge they had of it in Norfolk was the 25th in the afternoon.  The pilots if I recollect first reported the capturing schooner to be full of men & black sided- it now seems they kept so far away that they could not see whether the ship was bright sided- still they alledge to have distinctly seen the cross in her foretop sail- This circumstance is the most striking, & yet it is possible that at their distance they might be mistaken even in that.  I observe a story has been circulate in NYork of an oyster boat having supplied the ship at Sea- & that is believed, contradicted & reiterated- If that were true it wd. indeed be some comfort, as it might accot. for the whole affair, making some allowances for discrepancies.  It is altogether a painful subject, & has caused me much perhaps useless anxiety.  but no benefit can arise from despondency.  & it is our duty to submit to the Divine Will- & our best interest too- Let us then hope while hope we may-29th
   
   The letter from Capn. Miller which I read in the papers that reached us last evening, stating that information had been recd. from the Break Water by a Schr. just arrived, that she has passed the Susqa. of Chincoteague, a shr. along side of her- if true, wd. seem to put an end to doubt- But why did not Miller mention the name of the Schr. at the Break Water.  & how did that Schr. know what he saw was the Susqa.  If the ship was in the situation mentioned, & at the time mentioned, it argues a most extraordinary degree of hardy hood in the Pirate.
   
   Yesterday commenced the battle on the Judiciary.  Judge Hopkinson opened the debate- in a masterly manner- he spoke for 3 hours, & then gave way to a motion for adjournment- of course he will proceed with his argument 2d. day morning.  I hear it will prove unavailing- so many of the Convention being resolved on a change.  The discussion will no doubt be protracted thoughout all this week, perhaps even another- so many will try to distinguish themselves on this fruitful subject.  Feeling so much disappointed by the issue of the militia question I can no longer hope for much good from this Convention.  Indeed I care very little now how bad they may make a constitution- the worse perhaps the better-as the people will be the more likely to, reject it.  Earl made his appearance yesterday and forthwith commenced taking notes of Hopkinsons speech- He will attempt a reply- so will I suspect Ingersoll- but the most powerful antagonist will be Woodward- from Luzerne.  He is plausible, argumentative & fluent, but with all a thorough radical & in my judgement a most mischevous politician.  Doran & others are still absent- When I shall be relieved from my unpleasant imprisonment I cannot say.

   Please say to Wm Evans that I have just recd. his Note with the Pamphlets, of wh. I shall endeavor to make a proper use- but as that subject has been dismissed for the present, & the mind of the members are filled with the Judiciary question I fear were I now to distribute them- they wd. just be glanced at- thrown aside & forgotten- The subject will come up again on 2d. reading & then may be a suitable time for their distribution.  My own fears are however that Friends have little more to hope for from this Convention.Thos. P. Cope

   Dear Alfred,
   
   It is growing towards being after sunset, but while Job is making arrangements for our departure tomorrow morning in the Massacheusetts Steamer for Providence, it falls to my lot to drop a line by Wm who is intended send with the Carriage & Horses next day, by return of the same Steamer to NYk thence to proceed on his way to Philada.-  You will all be gratified to hear of thy dear mothers improved health, & also of Eleanors- altho we have experienced hot weather for some days, & have qualms as to the propriety of throwing ourselves into a more heated atmosphere-  Stephen P. Morris arrived here yesterday from Providence, & reports the thermometer to have been up to 95 the day before.  The air since dinner to day has become cooler, & we may reasonably hope will improve a pace shortlty-  Other things change as well as the weather- & now after writing so far, a bell man announces that a Balloon Steamer is to be here tomorrow from P. & return again at 3 AM-  We wished originally to go by her- but she has undergone repairs, & there was this morning no certainty when she wd. be here-  We therefore had made up our minds to go by the Massachusetts between 6 & 7 AM-  We intend to visit N. Bedford, Boston, Wooster &c &c.  & stop at Hartford Ct where letters may meet us on our way home, not later than 10 days from today-
   
   We have visited most of the Lions- & among them the Library, where rest the remains of divers elderly volumes-  The discoveries of the Icelanders are there deposited-  We met in the St a certain antiquarian, named Bull, with whom we held learned converse on those discoveries-  On asking him if he had heard of the learned northener who had found a stone with Runic Characters- a temple, & an image representing the Scandanavian God Thor, in Brazil- He said he had not- & then added, "so long as they confined themselves to N. Am, I was willing to concede that point to them- but now that they are going to claim S. Am too, I wont believe any of it"-  The old man may have read our couplet- "They lose the whole who claim too much
    
   As Simon Snyder said in Dutch- And the Danes may now hang up their fiddle, & content themselves with their own Icy shores-The drives abt. Newport are fine- but we have too much dust- the grass is nevertheless very fresh- & the fields are beautiful- We visited a tract at Brenins Point, I side of the Island, & skirted by the Ocean- & a more fertile splendid farm, I do not remember ever to have seen-  They use the seaweed abundantly, as a manure- & also a fish called Manhayden- dragged from the Ocean by nets, & sold at 14 Cts a Bbl- They are very oily- but I do not admire the filthy practice of strewing them over the fields to contaminiate the air-  The bathing here is very good & Job & I use it freely- while mother & E continue their purifications in the warm salt bath-  Among our numerous lodgers we have had Abraham Knickerboker & wife- He the lineal descendant of the true Dietrich- & has his residence at the very spot described by Irving, whose description he says is very correct-  He is an intelligent and well informed man, speaking the English fluently- & his wife interested us very much, by her smiley face, he goodly appearance & good sense-  The good man himself is out of health, & his loving spouse seems very uneasy abt. him-  On leaving us they each gave us a cordial invitation to visit them at their home in the romantic poetical village of Schaghticoke-
     
   While writing Elenor bids me say- you have among you, used her [---] badly, in not even noticing a Letter- wh he took trouble- pains taking man- to endite to some of you- but as she has stepped out- I do not know when manufactured, nor to whom directed- Cara’s epistle of odds & ends- like this of mine- has been received, & was, for her comfort, very satisfactory-
   
   Having in council duly convened decided to go by the Baloon to morrow.  I have come to the conclusion to rest for the present from my labours- to resume if needs be, in the morning but not until I say that we this afternoon paid another visit to the afflicted family mentioned before- none of them are better- the mother indeed much worse- she seems destined we think to take her departure to a better world very soon-

He abounds in anecdote- mostly I suspect the product of his own fancy- His atheism offended Knickerbocker much- it shd. be Knickerbacker- marble baker-  I joked & talked politics with the Judge for a while- but finding when hard pressed he became rude, I quit it- yet shd. be amused with his profundity of discourse could I have faith in his word-  He stated for instance that he had furnished the Bk.

   Dear Clemmie,
   Grandfather desired me to acknowledge the receipt of thy acceptable letter of last seventh day. I am sorry for thy sake that it has not fallen into better hand, but if thee will believe that I have the will to send thee such a letter as would give thee a great deal of pleasure, I will rely upon the interest it will have for thee as coming from among and giving thee a great deal of pleasure. I will rely upon the interest it will have for thee as coming from among and giving thee perhaps, the latest news of some of those who think so much of thee. Anne and I entirely agree with thee in considering that the pleasantest part of the days journey was when we were all traveling together. We ran off the track about half an hour after we parted and were four hours in a pretty hot place before we were on our way again. If we had foreseen that we were to pass nearly the whole day on the road might have he fellow travelers a greater distance and lightened me and others burdens. Thee must have had a very tiresome journey all the way home Henry Drinker tells us thee had to ride from Wilkes-Barre in the hot sun in an open wagon: he thinks they did much better. When thee comes down next winder, take thou Scranton unto. We are glad to hear that thee friend Uncle William so much better and the rest all well. Grandfather seems stronger and generally better than when he fist came out in the country- He sends his love to thee and all the family. Aunt Caroline, Frank and Ellie are at Cape May. I forget whetherthey went before thee left: they wrote several days ago that Ellie’s general health was improved We have heard indirectly that Mary was unwell- Julia has gone to Reading for a few weeks. Aunt Mary returned to Jersey yesterday I believe- She was kept in turn an account of Elizabeth’s mother having an attack very much like if not really cholera. She was very ill one night: they have gone to Cape May since with Henry and Ellie. The three families that live in that unnamed corner of this country that is so hard to find am pretty much as the left them they all send their love. Elizabeth says she would be very glad if thee would write to her if thee fells so inclined. Please tell Uncle William that a package for Grandfather by Henry Drinker came safe to hand the morning- Uncle Alfred has taken the letter out to him. He comes in and spends every "third-day" in town.   
   I hope we shall hear from thee often; if thee should write to me it would give me much pleasure.
   
   Affectionately thy cousin,
   Thomas P Cope Jr.
    
   Germantown, 7mo 18, 1852
   
   Dear Clemmie,
   
   Not having a woman's privilege as to postscripts I begin afresh.  I have no objections however to having reason to call the by name again – it seems more natural and sociable and I see thee look up from thy work or from study or quiet wordto hear what I have to say- I finished in a hurry yesterday afternoon intending to mail this before leaving town, but time failing I have an opportunity to say that Anne secured a letter from Eddy last evening in which he says nothing about his bodily conditions, but that his discontent which she had inquired about are improving" Your visit no doubt did him good. Visits from home to a boy at school are a pleasant recollections for the rest of his life.
   
   Thee did not grieve much about they blanket shawl when thee was riding in the stage at night; it will be cooler when thee comes down next fall and we will take care to sent it up to thee in time. Grandfather will be glad to hear from thee and I hope if thee is not afraid of a repetition of what thy first letter has brought upon thee, that thee will write to [.]
   
   With many desire for thy happiness.
 Affectionately, thy Cousin,

   Dear Uncle,
   
   As I have but little to do to day why should I not be punctual in answering thy very interesting letter? Perhaps my desire to answer thy letter is not a little increased by what thee says in the latter past of it, that I am indebted to a white-wash woman for it. I have puzzled myself a great deal about how that could  be and at last have come to the conclusion that the said wash-woman is white-washing Grandfathers house, and thee had on that account been obliged to go down to the store, where having nothing to do in the business may, has very kindly taken it into they head to answer my last, especially as the seems to have anticipated a something from the letter that was lying on the desk. However I hope they next will solve the mystery.
    
   As to Monsieur, I told thee all that I knew about what had happened to give us a bad opinion of him, I merely heard that he had moved to be something of an imposter. If he is an Imposter for I can hardly believe that he is, he must be capable of acting the part of the hypocrite extremely well.Thee says that thee cannot accept my excuse for not writing a long letter and that I did not squeeze the right way; whether I squeezed the right way or not, I cannot tell, but when there is nothing to come, nothing will come. As thee had been please to liken the case to milking a cow, suppose I do the same. If the cow has had nothing to eat (in other words if nothing has happened for one to tell about) squeeze might [mong] or stand still as the woman Grandmother Drinker told about did nothing can come: such is my case. Perhaps thee will say "why did not tell thee about those things that thee mentioned last: With respect to the first I have already told thee all I knew about. Monsieur which to be sure is precious little, and with respect to Wm Dennis Address it cost but a trifle, not worth mentioning. Look there! Haven't I argufied  my case right well; at any rate, if I haven't made out any good reasons, I have made it help fill my sheet. Don't thee think that I have made out as good an excuse as thee did for not answering mine sooner.
   
   Thee will please excuse my using the offensive phrase "do not understand": I would not wish thee to understand by that, that they letters are unintelligible to me; they are not by any means. The personages I alluded to thee says are a distinguished inhabitant of the renowned city of Moodle doosie and his faithful and only friend Tom, who by the way thee says is apig. Quite a Compliment! The boys of the 3rd Class (of which there are about a dozen) have just returned from an excursion they have been making this afternoon to the Inclined Plane with Daniel B Smith to obtain minerals. According to their account of the matter they had a delightful time after having obtained the objects for which they went, they went in swimming in the Schuylkill , and found the water very warm, notwithstanding it has been such a cold morning. They were at one time within a mile of the city, and I think had I been with them, that the temptation to run in to the city and say "how-dye-do" to all the folks at home would have been almost sufficient to have induced me to do so, if I could have stayed but a half an hour. Now won't thee acknowledge that I have written a pretty long letter, considering what a poor hand I am? I shall expect a sheet well filled with interesting matter (a thine usually are) to arrive very shortly folded up and dissected to me. I hope top thee mill acknowledge that I have been very punctual in answering thy last. Time slips away very fast and very pleasantly with me. Why does thee not come out and pay us a visit some day.

   Dear Clemmy,
    
    Thy very welcome letter came safe in to enclosure. I should have been quite disappointed if thee had not written to me and would like to think that there was not much debate in thy mind about it or at least that inclination took some part in it. Thee would give me a great deal of pleasure if thee would write often good long letters and thee may be very sure that I shall be interested in every thing thee chooses to tell me of thy doings and thinkings. I looked often for a sign that thee had not forgotten us, to appear on opening the letters we received from home while we were at Cape May and when we returned and still received no such sign, nothing but the belief from day today that we should certainly hear from thee before the next, save this from a letter about  it in which I expect I should have let fall some little misgivings which I should have reported of as soon as I got thy note. We had a pleasant and restful visit to the seashore and would  have been very glad if thee could have had thee with us. I should be almost sorry however that thy first acquaintance with the sea should be made when there is such a throng of visitors, it take away very much from your real enjoyment. I am glad that my first recollections of thesea at Cape May of other places here no such associations so that it seems to me in looking back on if it was always First Day it was so quite and pleasant. There were a number of new friends with us this summer, part of the time, all of Elizabeth's family except the little boys and several of Uncle Nathaniel's Mother has quite benefited by his visit and the swelling of his feet has almost disappeared.
     
   If thee had told me that thee took a walk every morning before breakfast I should answer that I doubted whether it would be good for thee, but I do not suppose once in a month or two will hurt thee. But to be up and about before breakfast and before sunrise I think is very useful and very pleasant. I am excellent habit, not very easy to get into. I used often when I was at Haverford at school to get up some time before sunrise and watch the coming in of day and I have not forgotten the freshness of the morning and the pleasant sight, and sounds there are at that quiet time. I As people are said to require less sleep as they grow old I hope to enjoy it all again and if I lived now, in such a pleasant country as Susquehanna Co. I don’t know what it might do for me. And it is very good to have a little time to yourself before the day begins, not very hard to get into the practice, very easy to help in it and easy to fall out of it, as I know. Do not think I am making light of thy "improving." I used for a long timeNot very long ago to be up some time before breakfast and desire very much to get back into the habit and intend to when I begin to practice my preaching's to thee on this and other matters.
    
   I will not believe that thee is not fond of rambling about the woods until I have a chance of cross-questioning thee about it. I dare say it would turn out that it was being overtired that thee does not enjoy.
   
   I believe I have not much family or other news to send thee. Aunt Caroline has been kept to her bed for some time, but is getting better. Mary I suppose thee knows was at the sea shore with us. Aunt Rebecca and son James B. are pretty much well. Grandfather continues very well for him and seems contented and comfortable at Uncle Alfred's.  Our [] families both great and small members are almost as usual. Is Mary Anne Morris a sort of cousin to thine? If she is, thee will have to make a little room in the place when thee keeps thy cousins, for Sandy Martin.
    
   Now Clemmy thee will agree with me that this is not an interesting letter. That is what I never did and never expect to write and thee must not take it as any measure of my good will toward thee. If I had followed my inclination it would have been written very soon after I got thine, and I hope thee will find time amid thy household cares, if this finds thee still at the head of affairs to answer it very soon. I send Elizabeth love on my own responsibility and if I was at Germantown should have various such messages for thee. If I have not replied to every thing in thyletter it is not because I do not find a great deal of interest on whatever thee tells me about thyself. I am much obliged to thee for taking my lectures so kindly and remember them so well.
   
   Affectionately thy Cousin,

   I suppose Father has told you that I arrived here safe and therefore it is needless for me to say anything in that respect.  I found it was harder to part with Father than I expected:  I felt the difference between being with my connections and Master Lewis' family; however I have got pretty well used to their noise and have got once more settled down to my studies pretty much in the old way.  I am sorry to have it to tell you that the cloth I got while I was at home is damaged.  there is a very ugly place goes round the sleeve of the coat and there are a few spots in other parts of the cloth.  I dare say this will be very disagreeable news, and I am sorry for it but can not help it.
   
   I did not find Alice as I hoped to find her, down stairs, nor is she able to come down now.
    
   I would tell thee nothing to tell Grandmother but I shall give her the pleasure or I hope I shallof informing her myself.  perhaps thee may wonder what I mean by saying, I hope I shall; I dont mean that I hope I shall write to her but I hope it will give her pleasure if I do write.
   
   I have read Think-I-to-myself since I cam back and I think it is a very interesting tale; but I suppose thee would much rather hear that I had read the Bible and so I have read some of it.  perhaps thee will say to thyself, I wonder how much; why I can tell thee 3 verses at least.  perhaps thee may now say to thyself, very little indeed; but hower if used rightly it might be better than none.  I have not heard from Caroline since I left her at West-town but she seemed to leave us quite contentedly, an indication I think (though I dont pretend to know much about it) of a strong mind.  I can easily see a difference between me and her in that respect, (but it is best to be sensible of our faults Jacob Lindley tells us) for I am pretty sure that I felt more dejected when Father left me than Caroline did when Father left her.I would like to hear how Father & Alfred got home but I suppose if any of their legs or arms or any of their bones at all had been broken I should have heard of it.
   
   The preceeding lines have been written several days ago and I was waiting for a favorable opportunity to send them which I now have by Charles Allen.  one of my hands is again affected by poison.
   
   The spots on my coat have in a great measure disappeared.

   Dear Brother:
   
   I reached this place after a pleasant journey, which occupied, as usual, 2 days.  I had pleasant company, & never before endured so little fatigue in crossing the Pokono.  the road over it is considerably improved.  I had the company of Jos'h [S?]inton  from Nazareth to Wilkes-barre.  he was on his return from attending the Orthodox Yearly Meeting.-  I was much pleased with the verdant appearance of the fields in this part of ye country.  ye season is much less advanced than usual at this time of year, but the grass looks well.-  there has not been so much done at my buildings during my absense as I expected wd. have been done, but ye workmen are now busily employed.  my Scotch farmer, I think it likely, will maintain the character of his countrymen for industry & fidelity, but I have not hired him long enough, fairly to test his qualifications.  ye female part of his family, however, it too numerous to suit me, as I have but little employment for women.-  tho' I have but little to communicate, I tho't I wd. not let a private opp'y pass without informing you of my safe arrival here & present health.  I shall feel anxious to hear from the invalids of thy family, tho' I hope they are not now invalids.-  I hope also that our new Mother may, by this time have regained her usual health.-  please give my love to all my kind friends & relatives, with whom I have so recently passed so many pleasant hours, that ye chain of communication between us, though separated, seems unbroken & strong.-  if thee shd. see Uncle Jasper please tell him, that I delivered his letter to Henry Colt, but that John N Conyngham had left Montrose before I arrived.  I therefore immediately forwarded the letter for him, to Wilkesbarre, & have little doubt but that he received it before leaving there for Bradford County.   I remain thy affectionate brother,
   Wm D CopePlease say to Eleanor, that I hope she will not mention to Cousins Abby Ann & Emma, any remarks that I made with regard to the evening company invited by them a short time before I left the City & of which I was one.  such observations are sometimes repeated under circumstances that give them an air of more seriousness than was intended by the one who makes them.[Note in second hand: W.D.

   Dear Brother:
   
   I tho't it ye less necessary to take a formal leave of thee before my departure from ye City, as I had a prospect of revisiting you, before ye lapse of a very long period of time. I therefore was not satisfied with bidding thee farewell, thro’ ye medium of thy "better half". No material incident occurred during my journey hither. We were amused by ye remarks and minute observations of one of our fellow passengers, a young man of respectable appearance, probably 25 years of age, who, as I understood him to say, had never before been 14 miles from Philadelphia and had never seen a mountain. As we approached the Blue Ridge, his curiosity seemed on tip toe. The most novel circumstance that I have heard of having taken place during my absence from Woodbourne, in a hunt after wild boars. G. Walker shot one during ye day which was occupied in the chase. I will give thee an idea of other enjoyment that we may have in ye country, in Winter, by transcribing an extract of a letter from an accomplished young lady of the City of N. York to her friend at Woodbourne, who has permitted me to enter it, in my diary: "I have just returned from a visit to ye country, and have been indulging my taste for Winter scenery, checked vegetation and leafless tress to perfection. I had not indeed ye warmth of a good Schuylkill coal fire, to counterbalance ye want of which, I adopted ye beautiful sentiment of ye late Dr. Drake, "to make our climate in ye heart, & I feel 'tis Summer there."  what delightful privileges we have in ye country.  in ye gay Metropolis, we cannot as there, throw round our shoulders, ye old cloak, pitch on ye slouched hat, & slip on ye leather shoes-, then, race off, with ye freedom of untamed savages.  no, my dear, ye glass must be consulted with percision, ye dress arranged for observation,- ye hop, skip & jump, exchanged for ye measured step, or mincing gait, & a certain air of nonchalance, thrown over ye whole exterior."-  a few days after my return hither, E. Walker reached home.  ye joy of ye family was extreme, on again seeing him, after an absense of 7 mos.-  his seemed equally keen.  whatever may be his deficiencies, he is certainly a most affectionate father, & ye attachment between ye different members of his family, seems to be mutual.  this feeling extends even to the servants.-  a pleasing instance occurred on my arrival.  a nice little Germantown girl, was ye first to see me.  she ran eagerly to inform the family, but so excited were her feelings, that she cd. only say, Mr. Cope, Mrs. Cope, unaccompanied with any explanation of ye cause of her agitation.  they inform me that she shed tears on my leaving them for Philada.-  in my intercourse with ye head of the family, herementioned, as well as with others, I have been lead into this train of reflection: if we associate with those only that are perfect, who are to be our companions?  is it not wise to accept thankfully of kindness from ye hands of a fellow-being, whatever extended, to return like with like & good for evil, (a hard thing for poor human nature to do,) to condemn in a mild, frank & friendly manner, his faults, & try to show him by our own conduct, a good example for imitation.-  it is probably a fortunate circumstance, that, in a new country, we are almost obliged to hold more free inercourse with one another, than people in other situations.-  many prejudices are thus removed, & we are taught to know that tho' thro' selfishness of men, we may be injured, we can also be benefitted by them.  but I acknowledge it is a nice point, to avoid shipwreck, upon the rocks of misanthropy on the one hand, & the quicksands of good natured credulity, on the other.-  E.W’s mind seems much beclouded on ye subject of religious & society concerns, tho' he seems to harbour no asperity towards any party, but evinces kind & good natured feelings towards all.
   
   I found thy letter of 8 ult. safe in the P.Office here, & return thee thanks for ye names it furnishes, of the authors of communications for "the Friend".  several of them, I had not ascertained during my stay in the City.  "the Voyage to India," I was informed, is ye production of Dr. Reynell Coates.

   Dear Brother:
   
   Thine of 29th ult. has been rece'd. I was pleased to learn that our parents were well, and hope that Edward & Alfred may be benefited by their proposed excursion and that thou may’st also find time to enjoy ye benefits of ye same kind of recreation. Ye country is now enlivened by visitors from ye City and Susquehanna Co. is favoured with a share of them. James Holly Biddle bro't back with them from Phila. their sisters Sarah Biddle and Mary Drinker, and E. Walker's family have ye company of ye widow Morris, and her daughters, Susan & Elizabeth. We have lately been favoured also with a visit from Joel Woolman and Alvin Keyser, appointed by Abington Quarterly Meeting to visit Friendsville Preparative Meeting. they appeared to be man of plain, unassuming humble manners, and were well received by both Hicksites & Orthodox. Cha's Shoemaker accompanied them as far as a Stroudsburg, where he became so ill, as to present his proceeding further. We have subsequently had a visit from Ja's Bell, another orthodox friend and an elder, appointed by Stroudsburg Monthly Meeting.
    
    Dan'l Stroud has been indisposed, or he also wd. probably have visited this part of his flock.  he occasionally writes excellent letters of advice to afford thee an idea of his decisive and at the same time affectionate letters of language & manner, I will give thee an extract from one of them, recently addressed to E. Walker: "distressing as is ye fact, yet it certainly is the case, that the Hicksites are a distinct Society from Friends, and ye separation proceeded from ye leaders of that seccession having become corrupted with anti-christian doctrines, mostly Socinian, but compounded with some other speculative notions, made up into bills to suit ye subjects to whom they were to be administered, and gilt with specious professions of great spirituality, to captivate members and professors with Friends. this with various practices, such as are too commonly used in electioneering, have beguiled & seduced many, who have not or had not previously embraced those awfully dreadful notions, not fitting to be styled doctrines, when we are speaking of religion, and whether these will become leavened into the mass of infidelity with their leaders, or separate from them remains among the things which futurity must disclose. that thou & I, and ye dear children Providentially entrusted to our care, may be preserved from this direful contagion, I have earnestly craved, feeling some hope, that we may resist every temptation that may beset us, to unsettle us and loss about with every wind of doctrine.
    
   If we ever knew anything, "as we ought to know", le us "walk by ye same rule and mind the same thing." Let us be satisfied with and established in "the faith once delivered to ye saints",and say with ye apostle, "thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift", in uniting Deity & virility so as to provide salvation for our fallen race, consistently with divine justine & mercy, though the august plan & means were such as Angels desired to look into.  and tho' this wonderful union is beyond their conception & ours also, we shd. be grateful for it, for surely it is exactly adapted to the condition & need of us poor frail beings, inasmuch as it is complete, or affords complete salvation, both indemnity & cure. Redemption from the penalty & power of sin; remdemption from the penalty by the atonement made by Jesus Christ, our Lord, being God & man;- and redemption from ye power or government of sin by the Holy Spirit, so received into & operating upon our hearts, as to change them, producing a birth of ye spirit & furnishing divine ability in faithful humility & obedience, to resist temptation & be preserved in divine acceptance."++++- Present my very warm & cordial love to thy very dear children, who I feel expressibly near to me. I remember ye kindness of R. T. also; and entertain sentiments of regard for our dear yound friend W. D. Cope, your near neighbour. under sensations which I am thankful for, I bid you all affectionately fare well." (signed) Daniel Stroud.-
   
   Thy observations with regard to ye precarious tenure of our hold on life, are worthy of being often recalled, & deeply impressed upon ye memory & ye heart.- with thyself, I hope & trust that ye deep concern & unbounded affection of our dear deceased Mother for us, will not have been uttered & felt in vain;- that ye expression of her hopes & fears, her sighs & sorrows, have not been for naught.-  I sincerely desire that ye change in ye management of your business, may be advantageous in a pecuniary point of view to thyself & Alfred, but ye annunciation of it, caused a shade of sorrow to pass over my heart. ye expunging of a name, upon which we have been in ye habit of looking so long, that we look upon it with a degree of veneration, seems somewhat like ye disappearance of an old friend or favourite.
   
   I have had workmen pretty constantly employed at my building since my last return from ye City, sometimes to ye number of 6 or 8, sometimes more. ye attention which these, my farm & Father's estate, occupies my time, pretty fully. ye last mentioned concern requires in its present stage & condition much attention for but little profit. but it is absolutely necessary that something shd. be done to guard against ye effects to which it is liable from an accumulation of taxes & interest. I still look forward however, to a change, decidedly for ye better, but we are so apt to be too fast in our calculations, that it becomes us to be cautious.-  I think it likely from present appearances, that my investment in ye stock of ye Leigh Coal and Navigation Co, will be a good one. I am not displeased to find myself becoming more & more interested in my farm. I form an attachment for every tree & every field, which has called forth my care & attention,- for every hill and every valley, that have afforded me gratification by their smiles & beauties.  ye lover of ye country can often realize ye enthusiasm of [Hervey], & exclaim, "when the little hills rejoice & the vallies laugh & sing, who can forbear joining ye general joy". I have at all events reason for self gratulation, inasmuch as I am more pleased with my present mode of life, than I at one time ever expected to be.- I early perceived that with my limited means, I mustbe contented with advancing slowly, in any improvements that I might wish to make, but it has been very difficult to reconcile myself to making so little progress as yet been able to make, owing to ye circumstance last mentioned as well as others.-  I expect that ye capital & influence that Caleb Carmalt is employing in favour of this County, will be of advantage to it, though we we may not feel their effects immediately in this neighbourhood.  some of E. Walker's Family, who have recently been at Friendsville, mention, that he has 30 men & 9 yoke of oxen at work on his farm.  two of his brothers, & one of his sisters have also pitched their tents at Friendsville.-  his brother James, fm Philada., has purchased a farm of 1000 acres & is employed in improving it.-
   
   With particular love to all, I remain thy affectionate brother,
    Wm D Cope
   
   Since writing ye foregoing, I have received thine of 6 ins’t. I will attend to doing what is necessary, to further ye collection of ye divd on ye Canal loan. I hardly expect that there will be any divd. this year, on ye Lehigh Canal stock, but if there should be, I will be obliged by thy informing me of it.-  in addition to the drafts referred to by thee, I passed one to C. Avery & Co, on ye 10 ins't, numbd. 10, for $50.00.-  I regret that I can get no tidings of my missing papers.-  I am obliged by ye information communicated by thee respecting the C & D Canal.  that great work, seems still to baffle calculation.Woodbourne

   I have often thought of thee since leaving Bloomsdale, and feel quite desirous to have a little conversation with thee upon paper. there is something animating in placing ourselves in imagination by the side of a fair lady, and holding sweet converse with.
    
   "Woman, lovely woman, whom Heaven designed to temper man."
   "We had been brutes without thee."
   
    I hope I shall have the pleasure ere long of paying my respects to thee in person, but as I wish to do my best to please thee, I must not tire thee by too early repetition of my last visit. I hope also that I shall be less and less stiff and formal in my manners, as our acquaintance & friendship advances and increases it happily, such should be the tendency of things. A young lady possessing the recommendations of youth, beauty and accomplishments, told a mutual friend at Woodbourne, not a great while since, that the greatest objects on she had to make against me, was that of being to reserved. Alas! I could not say the same with regard to herself, much as I appreciated many traits of her character, she wished she said, that she could take the liberty of telling me what she thought of me. As amongst our best friends, are those who tell us of our faults, I could not but feel grateful for the reproof, though indirectly made, and hope to be improved by it. I shall also feel grateful to my dear friend Susan, if she will point out with frankness and freedom any faults that I may possess. But I pray thee not to do it, so as to give the appearance of its being done with the intention of wounding my feelings. I am keenly sensitive to a blow struck with such a view. It is a great mistake entertained by some ladies, thatmen have no feelings, because they restrain or suppress them. a sensitive mind, will I think readily perceive the difference between reproves made in a proper manner, and form a proper motive, and thos made with different intentions. I am credulous enough to believe, with confidence, that none wo be made by them of the improper kind.- besides many things that I think I shall have to say to thee when we meet again, I have some also to show thee. but I have been hoping that before the suitable time for visiting thee again, shall I arrive, I will feel something like being really well. This [---] air that we breathe here is so different from the elastic atmosphere that I have latterly been accustomed to, that I have not felt right well during any part of my last two visits to the City.-  nothing like a Susquehanna County glow! Thee don't know how much better I look when I acquire the ruddy hue that the mountain air inparts. thee knows however, that it will be good policy in me to try to persuade thee that my appearance in general, is somewhat more captivating than at present.- the idea has several times occured to me, that it would perhaps have been well for me to have offered my services as gallant on any excursion that thee & thy sisters might wish to make, either to the City, or elsewhere. if thee should not should not be procided with one more suitable than myself, will thee use the freedom to drop me a line informing whether it would be agreeable or desirable in such case to have my servie? The number of our house is 36. please excuse as well as thee canthe vanity that I have displayed in alluding to myself in the foregoing lines.  it is a vice that is very apt to show itself, however slight may be our reason or excuse, for displaying it. I wish, thee sees, to forestall thy condemnation of it, by condemning it myself. I bide thee adieu and wish thee health, happiness, prosperity and an increase of regard for thy affectionate friend.
    
   Will thee do me the favour to refer to & read the 24th chapter of Genesis. I am so great a lover of artlessness and patriachal simplicy of manners, that I should be glad if thee would agree with me in admiring the picture of them therein presented.
   
   P.S. Be sure to look very pleasant the next time we meet; thee knows for ladies smiles they say are sunbeams and have a bland & genial influence on thou upon whom they are cast.Philadelphia 11 mo. 7 1832
   
   I have to apologize for not paying thee a visit this week, in conformity to the intention made by me at the time of my taking leave on 7th day last, circumstance not then thought of having occurred to prevent. however, as there is no necessity that I am yet apprised of, for my immediate departure for Woodbourne,  I hope that another week will not elapse, with my having the opportunity and pleasure of taking thee by the hand. in the mean time, wishing thee a continuance of good health & spirits, I remain as ever thy affectionate friend.
   
   P.S. Be sure to look very pleasant the next time we meet; for thee knows ladies smiles they say. are sunbeams and have a bland and genial influence on those upon whom they are cast.    N.B. my last visit was rather too much prolonged; but allowance must be made in certain cases, for some slight indiscretions. I will try to have better for the future.

   Dear Susan:
   
   As I had hoped and expected I received the thrice welcome communication of which we had been speaking, the evening of the same day I left thee. it was handed to me by my Father, who said that he had taken charge of it in the morning, upon finding it at the Counting House. so thou had'st been thinking of me during the three weeks' interval of non-intercourse. thee is a a dear creature,  (pardon the familiarity of the expression) and I thank thee much, for it. how delightful to be though of and remembered, by those that we love! "Tho' my pen has been idle this long, my thoughts have not". I recalled these expressions of thy "talking letter", again and again, and tho' the construction admits of doubt with regard to its correctness, yet the influence that thee was thinking of me was so agreeable that I concluded to assume it as the right and proper interpretation. at all events thy thoughts must have been indirectly, if not directly turned towards me. I am unable to answer satisfactorily thy quiery with regard to the authorship of the poetical effusion that I sent thee from Woodbourne. I have frequently recurred to it during moments of calm and quiet meditation, and have derived soathing satisfaction from the consoling and pious spirit that it breathes. I suppose that I shall in due time be informed by thee who the "intruder" is, who has had the presumption to invade thy tranquil haunts, whilst occupied with thoughts of me. If he shall molest or disturb any more, he will incur my high displeasure. restingsatisfied for the present with the expectation or supposition just expressed, I bid thee affectionaly adieu. I wishing thee, "Health of body, peace of mind, quiet by day; sound sleep by night".

   I hope to have the pleasure of seeing thee in a few days.

   I reached the City, about dusk in the evening of the day that I left Bloomsdale, after a tolerably pleasant passage. the coach was not crowded, and I did not make any very interesting acquaintances, nor any with whom I felt much disposed to enter into conversation, or to enlarge upon the topics of the day. and if I had felt such disposition, it would have been an unpleasant exertion to have attempted to make my voice heard or to elevate it above the noise & rattling of the stage coach, owing to my cold, and the condition of my throat. But tho' my voice was "idle my thoughts were not". And I suspect that thou cannot give a pretty good guess as to who and what were the subjects of them. ipon glancing over the pages of Father's copy of the "Sentimental Journey", I espied the article recommended for my perusal by my friend Adeline. It is contained under the heading, "The Remise. Calais". Vol. 1 I am highly pleased with the delicate manner used by thee in adverting to the postage subject. It has reminded me of the following stanza by Pope:
   "Men should be taught as tho’ you taught them not;
     And things unknown rehearsed as thing forgot.Tis not enough your counsels still be true:   Blunt truth more mischief than nice falsehoods do.
   
   the sentiment is open to criticism, but think that there is sufficient truth in it to make it worth of a consideration. I am fearful that I may have been considered by thee remotely or in some measure, changeable with bluntness in my manner of suggesting to thee, that it would perhaps be best not to advert to any circumstances that might be of disagreeable or unpleasant nature. the suffered suitable time and opportunity to pass for alluding to the circumstance in the course of conversation with embracing it. As I am now "an engaged man", I shall be desirous of complying with all the duties and requisitions thereof, and shall therefore take care not to forget to profit by thy kind hint relative both aforesaid item of those duties. I want thee as to admired applied to another, the following line of the Poet Burns, whilst I will admire them as applied to thyself:
   
   "A gaudy dress and gentle air may slightly touch the heart,
   But its innocence and modesty that polishes the dart."
   'Tis this in Susan pleases me, 'tis this enchants my soul,
    For absolutely in my heart the reigns without control."
   
   if it were not however that the metre and force of the third line would be destroyed by so doing I am say, this is one thing in Susan, or this is part of what pleases me.

   I may say the worst that I have for years   I have had a dreadfully bad cold, and though I think it would have done me good to see thee, I must now bid all hail! to Susquehanna County, and did not feel much inclined to go into company nor was I in a very suitable condition for so doing.  I hasten to the country of cloud-capped eminences, invigorating breezes, placid lakes, ever-varying surface and romantic scenery.-  there to feel myself reinstated in the occupation which is the height of my ambition, that of an independent farmer.-  an occupation for which I do not think my partiality as yet has diminished.  "Ye generous yeomen, [---] the plough"!  before taking my flight, I wish to let thee know that I did not forget the subject of "Friendship’s Offering" relative to which we had some conversation during our last rural walk.  the reason for my not sending the said work, I will give when I again see thee.  this seems to be a small matter to [---] to, but I think it best thus to do it, as I have never yet forfeited my word or violated an engagement, and I do not wish to give any cause for so however slight for supposing that I wd. do so.  if thee gets married to any one, while I am gone, be sure that it is to a clever fellow.  I am still somewhat inclined I should like to have had one sweet kiss of thy pretty mouth, before, peradventure, I should forever be [---] the opportunity (5); however thee knows we ought to learn to submitto submit with fortitude to our fate.  I am still somewhat inclinded to the opinion, which I have before hinted to thee, that I am not well qualified to undergo the ordeal of a systematic courtship, such as is frequently, perhaps generally expected & practiced in this part of the world.  if I ever succeed in making a capture of that fair citadel, or seat of love,- a lady’s heart; it must, I apprehend be by storm, rather than by gradual approaches, long trains, dexterous manouvers, or a regular siege.
   
   I have now only to say,
   "Adieu! a heartfelt warm adieu"! from thy still affectionate friend,
   
   if thou wilt only be persuaded, dear Susan, a drab bonnet, I will on my part agree to shade my face with a broad-brim.  if we do not then attract universal admiration, who will be so bold as to say that we will not at least command general respect.
   
   I have received a notice requiring my immediate departure from the City, if possible, in order to attend the next Court to be held at Montrose.  excuse haste and all the nonsense contained in these lines.-I expect to have the agreeable company of my Cousin Rebecca Drinker as far as [Stoddartsville].  being of a cheerful disposition, I expect she will prevent my spirits from flagging.To S,

   I wished very much to have had some conversation with thee during my last visit to Bloomsdale, relative to the subject of our recent & former intercourse with each other, but I thought that an approach to it, seemed disagreeable to thee (2).  why did thee, my dear friend, deam it necessary, in several instances during my two last visits to you, to display cold and repulsive manners?  I do think that the might have spared my feelings, considering that I had assured thee that I would not obtrude, or press any claim to favour from thee, beyond what might be agreeable to thee.-  ladies are sometimes incomprehensible beings, but I understood thee, to say, or it might be implied from what thee said, that thee thought I was in fault in not having written to thee after my return to Woodbourne last Winter.  do, I beg of thee, consider the circumstances of the case.  I supposed that thy objections to continuing correspondence, arose from delicacy of feelings.  I therefore suggested two modes of maintaining an intercourse between us.  one through thy Father, and another through my Sister Elenor.  but thee seemed to think that it would be a severe trial & effort, to correspond with a gentleman even if engaged to him.  thee asked me if I could not conceive it to be so [---] could not make allowance for thee, or something I think to that effect.  the motive which I have mentioned was not that which induced thee to object to correspondence, I supposed that the objection arose from want of inclination.  if the letter were the fact, would it not have been disagreeable to thee if I had been strenuous in urging the thing?  thee asked me during the courseof conversation which we had in the garden last week, whether I thought if thee had formed any new attachment or engagement during my absense, that thee would not have informed me of it.  I did not understand how I was to be informed, if thee did not write to me.  thee knows, I might have made myself appear rather ridiculous, if I should have been writing letters couched in terms of affection & admiration etc., if the circumstance alluded to should have actually existed, which was quite within the verge of possibility.  thee said that thee would forgive me if thee believes that I have been in fault, it is praise worthy and admirable to do so, but where there has been no fault there is no need of forgiveness.  I would rather that thee would say that thee tho't I should be exempted from blame yet acknowledge that we are apt not see our faults as plainly as others see them.  the more I have reflected upon the subject, since our conversation, the more clearly it has appeared to me that I am not indictable for the commission of offence (3).  thou hast had thy own way, and I have been governed by thy wishes, so far as have been expressed, from the first.  I have slighted no pledge, I have violated no engagement, I have receded from no advance that I have made, and I have blamed thee for anything unless what I have mentioned in the forepart of this letter.  I believe almost all ladies practice more or less in love affairs, at flirtation & coquetry.  but it seems as if we could hardly blame the dear creatures for what appears to be so natural to them.  the desire of making conquests by displaying the power of their charms may perhaps be said to be inherent in their nature for practicing the art.  I do not mean to say, that the passion is not kept underunder restraint when virtuous & religious principles are allowed to have their due weight in the mind.
   
   I tender thee my thanks for the politeness with which I have been treated during the progress of our intercourse.  courtship is generally a stiff, awkward business on the part of the one who is expected to make the advances, & places a gentleman in an embarrassing situation, demanding the consideration & sympathy of the object of his addresses.-  I again beseech thee not to blame me for unintentional errors if such have been committed.  at all events, I am determined, sweet, amiable lassie, to continue to like & admire thee, whether thou art displeased with me or not.  I had wished to have shown thee a correspondence between myself and a fair lady of the great City of New York, which thee would have acknowledged partakes eminently of the romantic.  there was no suitable opportunity however, of doing it.  it would also have afforded thee an opportunity (4) of seeing, that all ladies to not object to corresponding with gentlemen.  I can assure thee, I was not in love with her!-  Wishing thee health , happiness & prosperity, I remain, truly & sincerely, thy friend,
   
   + thee will of course understand that I should have considered myself under a sacred obligation not to have disclosed names.  (4) amongst many others,
   
   T.O.I confidently trust and believe that I am not mistaken in the opinion that thy sense of honour & propriety will induce thee to withhold from others, what I once said to thee with regard to thy Cousin E.D. [?], what I did say, I said with reluctance, and only because I thought a full explanation due to thee.  I never spoke on the subject in the same way to any other person unless perhaps to my Father.(2) I think however, that I cannot do much amiss by writing thee a few lines.  I would not do it if I thought they would cause thee any unpleasant feelings.(3) I offered to try to make thee as comfortable & happy as circumstances would admit.

   I was much gratified, Dear Susan, by the rece't of thine of 17th inst tho' it did not reach me as soon at it ought to have, if it traveled hitherward by the usual course. perhaps owing to the circumstance of this state not having been mentioned upon the endorsement it may have strayed for a time into another. we usually receive letters in two days after date from New York and three from Philada.  it met with a welcome reception however at its journey's end and I was pleased to receive through it, a confirmation of my misgivings with regard to the authorship of the "witty letter". I am more than ever bewildered and puzzled. circumstance are alluded to in it, which I had supposed were known to mortal being besides ourselves. I therefore concluded before the rece't of thy letter, that it must have been written in some measure with thy privity, thro' an amanuensis, or else that it presented an instance & example of some very singular coincidences in answer to they queries, I may say, that th' document was dated Philada, Sep. 1., post marked at the same place on the 3d. of the same month, and was subscribed with the attractive name & surname of Dorothy Dolittle. yet notwithstanding the feminine & harmonious form and fashion and sound of said name, I think, judging from the stiff & set stile of the hand-writing to which it is signed, that the writer and signer one and the same person, is of the masculine gender. "An enemy hath done this." I said to myself as I perused thy remarks in relation to it. But we have the power and I trust the disposition to defeat his insidious attack. Let us be on our guard, & not be taken by surprise lest he succeed in his assault. In coming over the various errors and blundersthat I might have been guilty of, and which might have been the cause of the reprobatory authourings of this mysterious letter writer, the aforesaid Dorothy, the subject of the New York Letters, came up in course, and I did not know, but that my having read them to thee might have been construed into a breach of confidence. hence the reason for my having mentioned them in mine of 27th. how I wish that I could enjoy with thee some of the pleasant walks of which thee gives such an interesting idea. but do not I beseech thee magnify distances so much, or thee will alarm me. thee speaks of the "far off country", that is of this delightful region which I inhabit as if it were "the far West.", whereas it is so in no other respect, than as regards climate. to be sure, a spur of the Allegany intervenes between us and the Atlantic, and intercepts the damp & chilly winds from old Ocean, but as regards distance, faculties of communication, and geographical position, we are essentially Atlantic and indeed is almost the Easternmost County of the State. Even the obstruction to communication presented by the barrier to which I allude, has been greatly lessened, and almost overcome, by the perseverance, industry, and enterprise of the inhabitants; and railroad cars, now pass & repass over it, as it were on the wings of the wind, & with the rapidity of the eagle in its flight. I feel some attachment to the country, but after the affairs of may Father's estate here, shall have been adjusted and settled, I expect that I shall not be indissolubly bound to it, or to remain in it, if things do not suit "all round," to borrow an expression from the shrewd Yankee. Eliza G Drinker who thee was bro't up in your neighborhood, says that she should never have wished to have left it (this County) if she had not have been overtaken by misfortunes of a kind to which we are all liable in the course of our earthly pilgrimage. I think I must have seen the essay on lovers mentioned by thee. I was copied into a Philadelphia paper taken by Des. Walker, entitled "The Sun", and credited to the ColumbianColumbian (Ct.) Regn. I enjoyed a hearty laugh whilst reading it. Pray tell me who was that one of thy acquaintance whom thee recognized in the description, and in which part of the essay is he described? I should like to know whether I have applied the right part to the right person when I next enjoy the pleasure of seeing thee, I must beg thee to give me a lesson upon the best mode & manner & means of sealing letters. I admire thy productions in the act exceedingly. how have thy Father’s English potatoes succeeded? Tell him that the product of some of those that I planted, are I think, without exception, the best that I have ever tasted. We have had love, a very abundant first year, more apples and peaches & raspberries than we knew what to do with. I selected 120 bushels of sweet apples from my orchard, and made of them some of the most delicious cider that I ever drank. Part of it I made into wine. The process of making wine from cider, is the most simple and least laborious mode of making it that I have anywhere seen adopted. the red Antwerp  raspberries grow here spontaneously and were so abundant this year, that I used a considerable proportion of them in my mixture for currant wine.
   
   If I cannot pay thee a visit soon, I think I must certainly furnish thee with a copy of mother's letter. in the mean time accept of the kindly remembrances and best wish of thy friend.

    I presume you started as you expected at 7 o'clock this morning and if I may judge by the coolness of the atmosphere here at that hour,  I should think that you needed your blanket shawls on the river, and now perhaps you have them on again pacing the deck of the steamer on the Sound.
   
   But I write now more particularly at Father's request. He wished me to record the uncommon softness and mellow tints of the sky. For the Sun after a cloudy day is setting perfectly clear & the evening is certainly one of the pleasantest we have had this season. Though probably more so to him, having just returned from his business in the city. We miss your company very much, but I have no doubt but that you will enjoy yourselves exceedingly and return refreshed as you expect in body and mind.

   William & I concluded it would be a good place to set you all example by penning a few lines immediately; accordingly I have seated myself in our old apartment at 12 past 9 o'clock, whilst the rest of the family are quietly giving themselves up to repose, for since your departure we have retired ever earlier if possible than usual, in order to give you an idea how matters work on School house lane. We feel quite impatient to hear how Sue bore the journey. I hope you experienced no detention in consequence of the [---]; we saw by the paper this eve that the passenger cars from New York were notable to come on [---] day as so large an amount of rain had fallen as completely to deluge the road. Our meeting at Arch st was so as very large this morning as it was expected the English friends would be there but owing to the lat[---] storm they could not arrive till this evening I supposed they are now in the city. Francis B was at Uncle Moses' this afternoon perhaps if Anna had been at home he would have done her the favour to have called but as he has now received information that she is not at home he will take precious care that he does not show his face in these parts for several weeks; he had a letter a few days since from Cape May.  the family are all very well and intend coming home in a few days. Frank says if they do not return by second day, which is the last day the boat runs, they will have either to swim or return by land so that it is most probable they will arrive by the the end of this week. Wistar spent this evening with us very pleasantly he says every thing is going on in the city as usual very few persons have as yet returned. Mother wishes that you should buy her a [--] de [---] dress in Boston. If you see any thing that would be suitable; she wishes you to consult your own taste in the matter. If you see one with a small figure that you admire get it or if you see a handsome plain one, not too light a color, something that would be suitable for autumn.  A plain one she would rather prefer if youmet with what suited you. Give my love to Cousins R & Maria and tell the former I regretted exedingly not having an opportunity to bid adieu farewell Mother and I fully expected to have seen him in the city and were quite disappointed in not doing so. I hope you will write soon and let us know how you are coming on as it is the only thing you can do to cheer us during your absence as the evening draws to a close I believe I must now bid you an aff good night. excuse haste.  if you either of choose to favour me with an epistle I will promise to answer it immediately and to some length.  your aff sister Mary.I suppose the Cousins R. & Maria to whom Aunt Mary refers in this letter where Cousins Robert & Maria Earle.

   Esteemed Cousin, I am sorry I had to leave the City without biding thee fairwell, and yet I found the task verry difficult, in taking leave of the few Friends I did; I am at the time safely arrived in a fruitful Country, and have a prospect of continuing here. Business appears to me to be carryed on to a very good Amount.  Hats I find a very good article, if thee has a mind to send me the Children's Hats, thee got of me, I think I could find sail for them much sooner than thee will be likely to put them off in Philada. I would take them at the wholesail price, and if thee has a mind to send them: apply to my Father and he will pack them up in a suiteable Caske, I wish thee would put up three Quire of large Hat paper in the Caske, thee will get it of Joseph Shoemak[er]. I have taken a Small Store in King Street. I have not been long enough here to positively assert that I can do Business to advantage, but I have scarely a doubt of it in my mind; I wish thee to send me, 2 doz of Sellerses Wool and Cotton Cards, 1 doz of each, if thee has any steel [---] Chains I should wish to have one doz of them . I likewise wish to have 2 Cards of steel keyes if thee has them not thy self thee may get themof Benjam Horner. he has them of 2 qualities thee has already been verry kind to me. I hope my conduct shall be such as to justify the Confidence thee has put in me and that I may act so as to be though worthy of thy Esteem, if thee could lern the Cash price for hemp and send it me by Elwood I would thank thee, I am in good health and Spirits and remain
 Affectionalely thine.

   I did not get thy letter of the 10th Inst. until yesterday; we had not quite completed our collections of Money subscried for the Engene: on fourth day next we shall procure a Check at the City Bank fro $405 and forward it to thee by Post, if thee has not engaged a Vessel to bring it round: we would prefer Capt. Elwood or Hand who will be at your port in a short time: they are careful and will only charge half freight.
   I observed in thy last letter an appology for the publication of my letter to our friend Joseph Bringhurst: altho I feele no kind of Ambition to appear in print. nevertheless if the insirtion of that communication can answer any useful purpose. I shall rest satisfyed. I must have appeard obvious to the convention that it was intened only for the eye of a discriminating friend: I am glad you published it in the form you did. More especially in omiting the conluding observation respecting the Richmond society. Not withstanding, they are sound facts which can be subtantially attested; shuch opinions may have a tendancy to extinguish the little spark of life yet remaing among them: & that I would cautiously avoid, please to excuse my detaining thee, the addresses, with a number of Copyes of the minutes of the Convention, were recd by Cap Hand. I have taken care to put them in the hands of a number of friends, & have distributed the addresses to the free blacks among the thoughtful & sober part of them they appear thankful for the attention, Indeed I consdier your labour towards these people, often profitably bestowed we have some among them who are sober orderly good member of society.-  last week I had the pleasure of spending a day at thy Brother Jasper, in Baltimore. am sorry to infrom thee I left him indisposed, tho I believe not seriously ill.  please remember me to thy family & friends. respectfully,

   Dear Uncle,
   
   You will be surprised to receive a letter from me, particularly dated as it is. I have not time to relate to you all the accidents, & delays which have occasioned our remmaing yet in the river, Wm Adams no doubt can inform you, I have scarsely time to write to you at all.- -
    To day Captian Banks asked me what clothes I had. I answered that I had but one round about, one thick waiscot, & one pair of trousers.  Upon which he ordered the boat ready, & took me ashore to Taylor's, & got me one round about, one waiscoat, one pair of pantaloons & one red flannel shirt with sleeves. The whole ammounted to $17.25 cts. which he said Mr Adams would pay, & I must write a letter to my father to inform him of it, & tell him to refund Mr. Adams.Now you Know my Dear Uncle that it was out of the question to tell the captian of the terms on which my father & me were. What could I do? I could think of no other expedient but to write to you & request you to refund Mr Adams. The Keg of tobacco which you was so kind as to give me, after it is turned into money, will enable me to pay you the $ 17.25 when I come back, & by trading, I hope to be able to pay you all the money that I owe you. As for the kindness which you have shown me, I feel all the gratitude & affection of a son towards you, & never while I breath will I forget your fatherly goodness to me. Please to tell Grandmother Drinker that I would be glad if she would let my father know that I entreat his forgiveness for what I was wrong in, & that I hopeTo be reconviled to him when I come back, & that I repent very much of all my bad conduct to him & am becoming quite changed in consequence of the hardships I endured & from reflection. I have no time to write anything more, please to give my love ot all your family & accept the same from you Affect [---]

   Dear Boys
   
   This morning's mail brings to me a sad  letter from your cousin Elizabeth Goodhue. It is my last wish to intrude upon your sorrow but I must make just a few words for my sake if not for yours.
   
   The greatesttrial of my life & even yet in retrospect it seems very great, your father was the very embodiment of kindness to me, the sort of kindness that allows your weakness to grow a little stronger from his strength & this and more than thisif possible he was to me. I remember, it was many years ago, the summer before Algernon went to College, your dear father said to me in the school house office "I did not sleep last night, for the thought of the responsibility of the rear-ing of these children of mine got so on my nerve that it banished sleep." I could ask for no better legacy for you dear fellows than that a father would wrestle in prayer the night through that God's blessing might rest on you & on his effort. He answered that prayer & long ago gave your father the assurance that he sought. I could write on and on for Icannot help mingling my tears with yours. With a messageof love to you mother & to Anna.

   Dear Lily,
   
   There has been a lack of vocal or written sympathy with thee this winter, and this brief message is only to assure thee of my love and frequent thought being freshly flowing.That mere words would only weary thee I know and I only sent messages to thee by notes to Rachel. It was my hope that long before this my own strength would have retuned and enabled me to go to thee. But that is not the case as only a very little exertion ispossible yet - writing, almost is a lost art. Excuse this detail, because I could not otherwise explain my absence. Now we have heard of Edward's illness, and I wish to send by thee my love to Jonathan and Rachel, when it is convient to thee.
   
   We Also understand Edward is much beter, I hope convalescent.Dear, believe me, thy loss is shared in some degree by me, for thy lovely Agnes was especially near to me, her gentle pure spirit now a lasting place in my heart.
   
    She always seemed as one apart from our every-day routine, and now she is in full & glourious development of all her Savoir has prepared her to be for Him. Always lovingly thy
    Hannah R. Garrett.

   My very dear Lilly,
   
   How many times lately has thee been in my thoughts and very pleasantly too. But owing to my peregrinations with the children, I have been unable to send thee a single greeting of love and good wishes. When John came out to Marple, and told me that one of my friends was announced as inelligible, I turned to thee at once, and said not to, with immense disapprobation and disbelief, and then revived mydrooping spirits with Oh! Alexis Cope! No, my dear, though I gave thee a sight of good advice in good faith, on Chellie's wedding day, about the opportune moment when house and grounds were in perfection, I was too modest to suppose it would sink so deep into thy heart, and show such good fruit so soon. Many thanks my dear, for they acceptance of my wishes as well as those of some one's else; and hope indeed thee will continue to follow my wishes when they again happen to coincide with thy own. This is destined to be a memorable year among my nearest friends, andone full of happines in its future consequences to Harry, Johnny, Chellie and thyself. How I wish to have a look at thee, and see with my eyes the happiness I feel sure must be thine. Am I to have no single friends left, my mind turns to H.B.E. and S.E. Marshall. I hope they will do nothing rash, and bring home some German counts or English baronets  with them. How much better we think it is not to risk our future to a stranger, but with those whom we can trust, & know all about their home life.
   
   As I look at Mary and Francis I begin to feel asympathy for thy mother, thus "bereaved of her children", as "I look in the future far as human eye can see" and think of the possibility that some pair of boys now fond of candy and fire-crackers may one summer turn their attention to destorying my house-hold harmony and peace-alas!
    
   Now I've written a deal of nonsense and a fear of Alexis comes before me, lest he has already imbued thee with dignifed scorn for such silliness. Do not betray me then, or I will whisper some of thy lightmindness in times past when I've a chance not that he would believe if I did I do long for some news from the European party,are they having a prosperous summer? With love to thy mother and thy self I am as ever thy warmly attached.

Germantown, 9.30.83.
   
   My Dear Carrie-
   I hope the expression of sympathy & affection may be acceptable, even though there may be no new thoughts of comfort to suggest.
   
   I was so sorry to hear from Sister Lillie today that Edgar's health had been poor. I though of him as a strong man. It will be a pleasure, no doubt, though mingled with sadness, to Nettie & thee, to minister to the comfort of your remaining brother.
   
   The memory of Alexis is one of calmness & sweetness. I did not know him well, yet recall with pleasure the queit cordiality of his greeting. Samuel Morris, who rode in the same carriagewith me at the funeral, said he had learned to love him much. I think it is grateful to look back on his life here as a happy one, & his life there as is fit & glorious consummation. And he left a dear legacy in his children. I am glad you have them. I count myself so rich in my dear nephews & nieces, my young brothers & sisters, as I sometimes call them. Does thee know I am a great-aunt? My oldest nephew, Joseph Rhoads, has a wee Edgar, away out in Plainfield Indiana, where he has gone to teach. Hetty  is out there, helping. Has been away nearly 7 weeks & we don't know when we shall get her back. She went to help furnish & arrange the new little home.
   
   Fanny & Alfred Garret were here last evening a while. We do think Fannya very lively have character, & Alfred seems to be coming out a fine manly boy, & doing well at college. 
    
   How the time does fleet away! Think of it being 50 years since we were at West-town together! And what can those fleeting years show? For me, a life made up of many little things, & with too many idle hours. I enjoy my work of various kinds though; simple household cares, an extensive correspondence, partly for pleasant sympathies, partly for teaching, & on the rest days, a restful work in the care of my first-day class. Dr. Rhoads holds a school at our house and I have as my class nearly 20 boys & girls from 9 to 14 years old who troop up to my room with me. I will not claim to do them much good. I don't believe in direct religious teaching exceptwhere there is an opening for it, but I think the hour passes not unprofitably, & they learn to find the study of the Bible pleasant.    
   I hope Ellie Alderson may continue to improve. I should be glad to hear from thee if thee can feel like writing, & to be told what your prospects are.
   With Love to Nettie & Thyself,
   ever thy affectionate friend

   My dear Annette,
   
   When I reached Holmhurst last week Nanna immediately presented me with thy package, and I opened and found the irresistable little gentleman from Dai Nippon. Where did thee pick him up, I wonder! He will be a most pleasant memento of thee, though I shall hesitate to insult his diginity by inkinghis fine skirts! I have thought of thee, and of you all so much this summer, and greatly wished I could have seen thee and Carrie before we leave. I hoped Mrs. Cope would return while I was at Holmhurst, but she is I supppose still with you. If so please give her my dear love. Thee will forgive me I know for this tardy work, I spent a whole week nominally at Holmhurst, actually between the city, Germantown, and all the [---]. Thee knows onlytoo well what such packing is. Now I am enjoying a few day's rest at Woodbourne before going back to Awbury for a square start westward. Virginia here and sends her love, also says to tell thee that I will meet thee in Italy winter after next. I tell her I give the message as hers, not mine! Much as I should like such a prospect; she is much more liekly to turn up there in the next year or two, than I! Lillie and the girls & Thos. & Elizabeth Cope are entertaining Dr. Norris and a Germandoctor friend in the parlor, else they would doubtless send messages. Please give my love to Carrie and Clementine, I understand you are all together, and are glad to know you have that comfort. With dear love for thy own self, and thanks for thinking of me amid so much sorrow, I am as always,
   
   Affectionally thine

   Dearest Aunt Anna,
   
    There is nothing to say to thee but that I think of thee all the time, and long to be near thee instead of on the other side of the earth. The letters with any definite news will be very slow in coming, as these of mine must seem late and longin reaching you. But thee knows, and you all know, how my heart is with you. I have been thinking of Father’s last message to his "more than brother", and of what both he and thee have been to me all my life. From my babyhood thee has made me feel almost as much thy child as mother’s and to me it seems those tiesare not broken but made strong for eternity, where our beloved cross to the Beyond. My desire is to be worthy of such an inheritance of affliction as mine. My love can never repay it, but that thee has always.
   
   Ask some to write me a line when they can. My Love to them all.
   
   Thy always loving niece,
   Anna C. Hartshorne

   My dear Son, I thought I could no longer forbear expressing in this way my feeble acknowledgements for thy many tokens of unparalleled kindness and generosity towards me and mine, the number and magnitude of which have frequently overwhelmed me with feelings that I cannot ever attempt to express, and that simple gratitude is but a feeble term to represent. For since the departure of my beloved and sainted consort, whose loss I more and more deplore and which seems more and more irreparable, and almost constantly weighs upon my feelings, there seems but few ties remaining to attach me to this world, except my children, who seem to me (pardon a fathers weakness), so worthily to rifle at their mother’s virtues and graces, that I hold myself excusable for wearing them in my hearts care, as constituting the principal charm of my declining years. So that amid all my trials, and I have had my share, I feel thankful that I am blessed with such a family, and have been so favored in sundry ways, not the least of which is that of having in incorporated with us, one, who seems to have been as a guardian angel to us all. And I am humbly sensible that I cannot be too thankful to a kind providence for such a blessing, and regard it as a special dispensation of divine mercy and goodness towards us, that thee has beenso cordially united to my family, and that so much affectionate unity and sympathy should prevail amongst us, binding us together in bonds, which I trust nothing will ever be able to weaken or to sever. My dear departed consort and myself did frequently dwell upon these considerations, and united in the belief that a blessing would attend thy influence and example on our children, particularly our sons; and I think this has indeed been already realized in good measure; and my sincere desire and prayer for them is, that they may continue to walk circumspectly and depend themselves wisely and consistently in all things, so as to render themselves in a degree worthy of thy almost paternal concern and kindness: which none of us can ever hope to compensate in any other way than by the most respectful deference, and affectionate regard; under a warm sense of which, I conclude, and subscribe myself thy deeply obliged and grateful father in law.

   First of all thank thee ever so much, dear Father, for the lovely flowers which came last evening.  They are beautiful and the vase of carnations and asparagus fern, which Miss Richardson put on my center table this morning, was truly good to look at!

Only once however, as the next time we tried it we found it was no good.  We had a good ride, however, down to the hill hitched on behind the sleigh.  I stay down in the evenings now till halfpast eight, and last night I laughed till my sides ached to see Dr. Shine and Mr Wells drilling Miss Barnard (one of the patients)- teaching her to salute etc.  They were killing!  They play a game here called Louisa, which is something like Parcheesee, and we have fun on that too.  I have progressedquite a little with the Autoharp, and find it quite absorbing-

   Almost a week you see since this letter was started, and I have a lot more things to acknowledge now.  Two letters from Mother, I think (one of which I have just read.  I don’t mean I haven't read both) besides one from Esther, and Frannie Strawbridge's weddinginvitation.  The latter was indeed a surprise.  I hope the man is nice.  The silk dress also arrived safely & in good condition I think.  Please give Esther my love and thank her for her letter which I was very glad to get.  I dont think I thanked Alg or Ted for their last letters either, though they camea good while ago-  Ted's especially.  I certainly do get nice letters.  I have been skating a good deal since I started this letter and having great fun playing hockey with Mr. Wells and Mr. Chipman and once with Miss Chapman (one of the nurses) & once with Miss Richardson.

   Dearest Family, 
   
   Well!  I have had two visits since I last wrote, & mighty nice ones they were.  Aunt L & Ellie came the first time (I told you I wondered  which 2 it would be, didnt I?) & after theyhad been here about an hour & we had a good talk Dr. Stedman came up and said they would have time for a cup of tea at the [---] House (his house you know) & that Miss Stedman was there-  Mrs. Stedman was away unfortunately.  He asked me to come down, too, so we all went& I enjoyed it ever so much, as it was the first time I had been inside their house.  I was sorry Aunt Lilly didn't see Mrs. Stedman, but I believe they have asked her & Miss Stedman to lunch with them at Brunswick so they will meet after all.  I was in hopes the Doctor would let me go into lunch with them some day this week but he thinks I am not quite ready for that, so they are coming out again.  Mary & Frank came on Monday & we had a jolly time, & Polly is coming out with Aunt Lilly & Ellie when they come, I think.  Frank will come again, toosometime, I guess & I have found out that I can call him up on the telephone if I want to.  I had a nice little talk with Polly last evening on that instrument, & a few words with Aunt Lilly.  The latter is not very fond of talking on it& they have had some rather funny times I guess, as they have telephones in their rooms to the office instead of bells.  To-day they are Cambridge.  I believe, lunching with Mr. Foote at the Colonial Club, & are at present looking at the glass flowers, I expect.  Of course youknow [---] or "tea" for them, & they met lots of people there.  I told Dr. Stedman I was crazy to go to it, & he said he would love to let me, but he didnt think I was up to it.  Perhaps I shall get to Class Day, however. 
   
   To change the subject, I dont think I ever acknowledged the little bookthee mailed me, Mother dear, from Aunt Lizzie Cope.  I [---] it all night, & sometime will you give her my love & thank her very much for me?  Then the photos & the card-case Aunt L brought.  The card case is all right & so are the photos, but I'm going to bother you to send mesome more things.  Thanks very much for these first, however.  The other things are- 1. the little lace tie to go around your neck, which Cousin Hannah sent me last summer- 2. my two lace collars- one of [---] edged with lace, & one of illusion with wide lace onthe edge- 3 my little gold pin (not a strap pin but a clasp) one of a pair I used to have, & my little white wreath pin (that is if it is all right to send them by mail), 4 & some more photos.  It is so nice to have those you sent, & I want more.  I'd like my group of the GoldenWedding for one thing, & if there is a copy of that picture of Mother & me I want that & there is a picture of Esther in a little frame & one of Mary Emlen- & any others you can find.  I cant have too many-  If the frames are bulky dont send them, though I'd like to have the ones Esther & Mary are in,if you can manage it.  If there are any old kodak pictures of Awbury or Conanicut send them, too, but dont bother too much.

   With lots of love I am in great haste. 
   Your very loving

   Dearest Family, 
   
   Well!  I have had two visits since I last wrote, & mighty nice ones they were.  Aunt L & Ellie came the first time (I told you I wondered  which 2 it would be, didnt I?) & after theyhad been here about an hour & we had a good talk Dr. Stedman came up and said they would have time for a cup of tea at the [---] House (his house you know) & that Miss Stedman was there-  Mrs. Stedman was away unfortunately.  He asked me to come down, too, so we all went& I enjoyed it ever so much, as it was the first time I had been inside their house.  I was sorry Aunt Lilly didn't see Mrs. Stedman, but I believe they have asked her & Miss Stedman to lunch with them at Brunswick so they will meet after all.  I was in hopes the Doctor would let me go into lunch with them some day this week but he thinks I am not quite ready for that, so they are coming out again.  Mary & Frank came on Monday & we had a jolly time, & Polly is coming out with Aunt Lilly & Ellie when they come, I think.  Frank will come again, toosometime, I guess & I have found out that I can call him up on the telephone if I want to.  I had a nice little talk with Polly last evening on that instrument, & a few words with Aunt Lilly.  The latter is not very fond of talking on it& they have had some rather funny times I guess, as they have telephones in their rooms to the office instead of bells.  To-day they are Cambridge.  I believe, lunching with Mr. Foote at the Colonial Club, & are at present looking at the glass flowers, I expect.  Of course youknow [---] or "tea" for them, & they met lots of people there.  I told Dr. Stedman I was crazy to go to it, & he said he would love to let me, but he didnt think I was up to it.  Perhaps I shall get to Class Day, however. 
   
   To change the subject, I dont think I ever acknowledged the little bookthee mailed me, Mother dear, from Aunt Lizzie Cope.  I [---] it all night, & sometime will you give her my love & thank her very much for me?  Then the photos & the card-case Aunt L brought.  The card case is all right & so are the photos, but I'm going to bother you to send mesome more things.  Thanks very much for these first, however.  The other things are- 1. the little lace tie to go around your neck, which Cousin Hannah sent me last summer- 2. my two lace collars- one of [---] edged with lace, & one of illusion with wide lace onthe edge- 3 my little gold pin (not a strap pin but a clasp) one of a pair I used to have, & my little white wreath pin (that is if it is all right to send them by mail), 4 & some more photos.  It is so nice to have those you sent, & I want more.  I'd like my group of the GoldenWedding for one thing, & if there is a copy of that picture of Mother & me I want that & there is a picture of Esther in a little frame & one of Mary Emlen- & any others you can find.  I cant have too many-  If the frames are bulky dont send them, though I'd like to have the ones Esther & Mary are in,if you can manage it.  If there are any old kodak pictures of Awbury or Conanicut send them, too, but dont bother too much.  You see it is so nice to have them to show to Miss Webb & other people to whom I talk about things, besides the phasum of having them to look at myself.

Awbury 7/8/01
   
   Dearest Mother
   It seems rather absurd to start to write to you so soon after you started but by my calculations it will have to be written tonight in order to catch you on your arrival as I will not be able to [---] tomorrow night and this must go by 4th days boat.  I suppose that as you will have fully recovered from any bad effects of the voyage when this reaches you it will be ok for my to express my present wonderings about your present condition.  I hope that you are not wishing like Ellie Garrett did that you were like a woman in Boston who hadnt any stomach.  I dont believe you are tho it is not so very long since you started and I am afraid that there is a chance that in spite of all opinion plaster;s etc the sea may still have its effects on certain ones, I wont mention names!  Well we are having not delightfully cool weather now.  It is simply great here at home but I can just hear those at Woodbourne and at Jamestown comment on their blessings in having it so cool and sigh for those of us who have to stay ay [---] in "that awful heat."  Well poor things it makes them feel a sight happier and it dont hurt us.  We have just had a circus of a time with a couple of fox terrier pups wich uncle Hazen invited in.  He has been keeping them down at the stable during his absense and Uncle Thomas' household have had a perfectly charming time with their midnight serenades.  Tonight he came home & brought them down here and they didnt do a thing but get themselves and every body else tied up and during supper time they raised perfect cane barking.  UncleHazen had to rush out a couple times to see the cause of the rumpus and now he has put them down in the cellar and because they are quiet now thinks he has solved the problem of keeping them quiet!  I have my doubts but am not saying anything just yet a while.  Grandpa and Uncle T. did not come down today after all.  Uncle Hazen received a telegram today saying that they would be down on 4th day.  I rather expect that Uncle Hazens stage party which comes off tomorrow night has rather discouraged them tho I dont know anything about it.  I did nothing during thr 4th except go over to Ros[---] in the evening and see them send off a lot of fireworks which were very good considering they were private.  The Goodhue kids were great sports.  Little [---] nearly turned inside out when a rocket or bomb went off.  On 7th day I took a Sabbath day journey out to Moorestown and played cricket which turned out desasterously to us as we were beaten 162 to 50 of which I made 10.  I stayed out at Moorestown with Stodgell Stokes to supper and had a very pleasant visit with them.  I had never been there before and enjoyed seeing them much.  Dr & Mrs Stokes inquired after you all.  I had intended to get out to Joes Morris' to stay over 1st day but I could not get in town in time to get out to Villa Nova before very late so I came home.  On 1st day I went to Frank Goodhues to dinner and in the evening went to Emlens to supper.  On 6th day Evening I went down to Shoemakers to see Anna & Frank Fortunately they were at home and I had a very nice visit.  Tomorrow Anna Hacker, Mary Jones, Annie Williams, Frank Stokes, Frank Strawbridge & myself are going up to Willow Grove.  I guess we will have pretty good time.  Tell Ed that I tried to getsomething for ASM but all the stores were closed before I got there at the Girard namely [---].  I will try & do it tomorrow.  I have not heard anything definite about my vacation yet but I guess I can have it sometime in Aug.  I am fine & well so dont be [---] of those who bother about the heat.  Give my love to Anna Ed Es. and with a great deal for thyself I am as ever thy loving son Alg.

   Dear Mother, 
   I believe that to-morrow is thy birthday, and having no more useful or ornamental token to offer I will dedicate this epistle to the celebration of the happy occasion. Think of that! Well, dear, please take much love from thy son, at  any rate, and thanks for thy letter. 
    
   We are having some most welcome rain here this evening which I hope will continue for sometime but am a little afraid is only the edge of a gust. We had a little rain last night too so I hope that the dry spell is broken. Things are pretty well dried up, and Milton has had to start feeding the cows.  Ralph is still staying with us which I certainly find very satisfactory, though I am afraid that his being here prevents the boys from having some of their friends, as four is about our number, for comfort. 
   
    Tom Evans came over and played some tennis this afternoon and Alg has been taking supper with him this evening. He is certainly an amusing person. 
   
    Last evening Ed and Alg went over to Stokes' for supper. 
    
    Next seventh day we will probably be away as Ed and Alg are invited to the Wright's at [Bayhrad] and Alg and I are bidden to Suis. I don't know how Alg will fix it up. Please give Father, Anna and Harold & Miss R. my love and Esther too if she is with you. 
    
   Maggie seems to bear up nobly, though Jennie has not been able to start to work yet. With much love from thy son.

   My beloved sister
   I feel as tho' I wanted to send thee another greeting before you leave Newport, thy last letter was very welcome with its good report of your welfare, I trust you have all continued in good case & will return home strengthened for the cares & duties of the winter.  As to dear little Edward, I do not suppose we shall know him, nor doubt he has changed much, I hope he will make up his mind to take food when he really needs it, perhaps he may take to a cup & spurn if a bottle is too insulting to his dignity.  Rebekah Smith's little boy is growing nicely & is a cute baby with the large dark eyes, your children ought to our ideas, & tho' his fractures are rather too large now for baby beauty he promises to develope that trait after awhile; at present his great charm is his good behavior, which is a real comfort to his mamma as her nurse left her sooner than she wished & she has only a young girl to assist her in taking care of him.  I suppose it will not be very long now before you are turning your faces homeward & it will be pleasant to think of your bring near us.  tho' we shall not see one another for awhile.  I am glad to hear from a letter to Katharine from Jthat you will not move into your own house until the 11th month, as I would like to be on hand at that season, having a fancy for such dissipations.  I have seen allusions in the papers to the burning of The Cliff House, but have not seen any account of the event, what a favor you were not there! & how about the boarders, did they lose their things was anyone hurt, poor Mrs Emmons I hope she was not there, (or thy Aunt Lizzie).  By the way what do you hear of the latter.  I trust her trip to England has been of use to her, when do you expect her back.  I am sorry to hear that Hazen is not very strong, perhaps he did too much, it seemed a very short time to be absent.  Since our last letter to thee we have had a visit from Susan Kito & Amy Roberts, they are bothundemonstrative people, especially Susan, but they enjoyed being here I think, SK was not well & did not like to ride so we had a quiet time, reading, talking, examining flowers & looking at objects in the compound microscope, one of Frank's late investments; they took tea at sister Eleanor's & also at Joshua's.  Sister Eleanor's summer home was vacated on 3rd day, she, Tom, Ellie, & Walter drove home with the two horses & carriage she spent one night at Arondale & one at HM Stokes at Chester & reached Germantown on 5th day evening.  Hetty & Wistar have gone to "Uncle Gideon's" & Betty is staying with us; the stay down here has been a real succes, the children have been very well & happy, have found much to interest & occupy them.Wistar & Franky have spent many hours in "bug hunts" & do manifest much zeal in the collection of beetles, butterflys & moths, & really have quite a large number; we labor under great difficulty as far as the study of the subject is concerned, as we have no books on Entomology except one by [Wood?] which treats of British insects, I quite want to get some good work & be able to learn the names of some of the creatures the boys have.  I have wandered away from my starting point, sister Eleanorfound the quiet of the country life & the absense of the many demands on her time & thoughts that she has to meet in Germantown a great rest, & altho' the house has not much to attract as regards situation it did not make the same difference to her it would to us, as she is so fond of riding she was out almost daily & enjoyed taking others drives.  Thee may remember Katharine & I find great comfort in sitting under the trees or lying in the hammocks when not busy sewing.  I suppose Hetty will stay down some weeks yet, her trip to Mt [Desert?] brokeinto her summer & I think she dont feel at all ready to leave Maryland.  John & Walter came down yesterday with Frank but dont expect to make much of a visit as they talk of going back tomorrow.  We heard a report that Sophy Kimber was to be married at Newport this summer, does thee know if it is so, her certificate has been sent on from 12th st, we shall miss her from Germantown she is so efficient & willing.  Now my dear sister when thee writes, which I hope may be [---] long, please tell us how thee is, Katharine wishes to know if thee has picked up any fat in the cool air, how does thy nurse geton, I hope she has proved an efficient help.  It is raining quite heavily now, which is not as acceptable as at some seasons, but when I think how we have longed for it in former days I dont like complaining.  The season of canning has arrived & folks in this part of the country are busy enough putting up corn, tomatoes & peaches &c, I should feel dubious about eating the products of some of the factories, as they employ Bohemians whose cleanliness is more than doubtful.  We were quite startled to see the death of Mary Morton yesterday, she spent a few days with Rebekah some 2 weeks ago, but was not well then & wished to get to Phila, it is such a favor she went up when she did or she might have died here.  Please give my love to thy mother & Lilly, kiss the dear children for me & accept for thyself a message of warmaffection from thy attached sister K sends love Hannah B. Evanscan thee tell us anything of the Newhalls.  Ive not heard from A for some time & fear her mother is more poorly.

   My dear little Anna
    
   I have thought of thee very often since thee left us on 4th day morning and shall be glad to hear how thee and Ethel made out on your journey, did she behave well? and was thee very tired when thee got to Montrose? I expect you have had a great many nice plays together, I mean thee, Agnes, Franky and Ellie, not Ethel and thee! I left Germantown the day after thee did and came down  to Maryland with cousins George Emlen and Katy Stokes, Edith came over to Conowingo to meet us, with Robert, and they put the trunk in the front of the carriage and sat on it instead of a seat, cousin George rode up with Horace Stokes, so we all got home nicely, only the roads are very rough and we were well shaken up. Just after dinner today we had a very hard rain and Wistar, Edith and Franky put on thin bathing clothes and ran about out doors until it was nearly over and then they went down to the streamthat crosses our lane and here they found the water so deep they took another bath in that, which they thought was great fun. They have a kitten a little larger than yours but she is nearly all white except her tail which is grey with a white tip; aunt Kate says her name is Pennyroyal but Edith don't like that at all, and Wistar says she ought to be called Tip. We expect Henry home tomorrow and shall be very glad to see him. Cousin George, Ellie and the children are not staying with us now, theyare at Gideon Smiths but the children, all except Sam, are to go home tomorrow. I hope Franky's trumpet did not get bent going up, and that he liked it and the game. I am afraid Aunt Lilly won't care to have him blow the trumpet very near the house, perhaps you take it when you go out rowing on the lake or walking in the woods. I hope thee will get quite strong and fat and have a very good time. Give my love to aunt Lilly and Anna and a great deal to thy self with a kiss from thy aunt Hannah.The Children have all gone to bed or they would send love to thee.Anna Cope Evans

   My beloved brother
    
   Thy letter of love and sympathy was very acceptable for tho' our friends cannot do much for us just now we do appreciate their sympathy. I am sorry I cannot tell thee that dear Katy is better, her fever still continues tho her temperature is one degree down this morning. I believe I told thee the typhoid symptoms had disappeared, which conclusion I jumped at from hearing the Dr. say the trouble about the abdomen was gone, and tongue clearing off, but on saying something like it to the Dr., he replied he thought they seemed to be developing much more then in the first weeks of the sickness.  Dr. Newlin Stokes came down to G. Smith's funeral yesterday, saw Katy and had a consultation with Dr. Sapington. Yesterday for the 1st time a few spots appeared in the abdomen and the Dr.s both said that was the 9th day of the typhoid fever, so dear child she has a long siege before her yet. It was a great satisfaction that Dr. Stokes said the case had been treated just as he should have done and he had no change to suggest except giving valerian instead of bromide to quiet her at night. They both unite in giving little medicine, only quinen to keep up her strength and all the nourishment she can take. Dr. [Lapingson?] thought perhaps Valentines extract did not suit her so we now squeeze the bloodOut of raw beef and give her that every four hours. Sam will send us down a druggists press, which will be a help in getting the juice out. Both Dr.'s said we ought to have a nurse, Dr. Stokes said he know of one he thought we could get, Frank telegraphed for her and I think Thomas Cope will probably see her for us tomorrow and if suitable send her down. It will be a comfort to have some one who is skilful and can move and change Katy with less fatigue than we do. Frank stays with Katy part of every night and helps much with the nursing, but Katherine is so anxious and nervous I fear she will be quite laid up unless we have some help. Katy's fever is not high, 102 2/10 the highest her temperature has reached and todayit is a degree less. She has little disturbance of the bowels and no head ache, her mouth and throat are very uncomfortable, feel gummy and sore and she feels very weak and weary. Slept but little last night and the hours were long and tedious for her, she is very patient but at times is nervous. Edith seems to be gaining, is taken down stairs everyday and takes tea with us, Dr. took her temperature today and found it a little below normal, says she must have a little brandy. It is rather depressing for her and [Esther?] and frankly, we are so taken up with Katy and the house has to be kept so quiet, so it is proposed for them to go to Uncle's for a few days and when Edith is stronger they may go to Awbury. If sister Eleanor takes Ellie away perhaps the girls could accompany her. I am glad to know you are better for Newport air, we had a very nice letter from dear Rachel please thank her for it and let her see this as I shall not have time to write to her now. I rejoice to think thee spent some days at Batemans and do hope thee feels stronger for it, thee will be lonely at Awbury with so many of both families away. With much love from usAll I am thy attached sister Hannah. I remember this is thy birthday.

   My dear sister
   
   I am once more at home and quite miss hearing of thy welfare and dear Anna's from Jonathan's letters.  I hope you still continue to gain and enjoy the mountain air.  When I got home last 2nd day, I felt very much used up with the heat & the change in air, but now have become accustomed to it and feel quite well, tho' the amount of moisture in the air makes things damp & sticky.  No doubt thee has heard particulars of E.W. Copes last hours, the close must have been very peaceful, both Ellie & Madgie express their feelings of thankfulness that their mother did not have to endure long confinement and great suffering.  The funeral was small, so many are away, S. Morris and E Allen bore testimony to her character, there was nothing said at the grave but there was such a sweet, quiet feeling as we stood silently there in the evening lights, everything looking so beautiful & peaceful, words did not seem to be needed.  E. Allen said after meeting today to Eleanor & me, that after sheheard of E.W. Copes death she went into her room and such a sweet feeling came over her, she felt it was a forecast of the rest & peace into which Elizabeth Cope had entered.  I rode to the ground with cousin Rebecca Evans, she spoke of cousin Elizabeth, said the letter thee wrote her had been such a particular comfort and help to her, that Rebecca had felt she must write & tell thee but has been rather burdened with calls, so I said I would let thee know about it, I think R sent her love to thee.  Will & Grace have both had mumps, and little Mary, (Alice'sdaughter) has been very sick, she is now gaining down at the Dennis and Grace has been there with them.  Cousin Wm & John Rhoads have gone to T. Brown's camp for their vacation.  I send thee one of Esthers letters as thee may be interested to hear something of the Conference.  It seems to have been a time of spiritual refreshment & uplifting & I hope may prove of use to the building up of the Church.  Eleanor says the spirit of love & unity was very marked, Alfred urged that all [---] and feelings of antagonism between old & young, conservative & progressive should be laidaside, which seemed to be the case.  Alfred seems to feel his mind relieved of the concern, he went back to Bupshire yesterday & is going on to Northfield.  Frank Goodhue also went to Bupshire will spend today there & go on to Brattleboro taking little Mary with him.  Edith Silver came up on 5th day eve, it was very pleasant to see her, she went home yesterday, Betty & little Elizabeth & Sam Mason all went with her.  Betty intends spending a couple of weeks at Swallowfield where she hopes to have a good rest.  Francis Jr is at Bupshire so all the children are cared for.  Sister Eleanor & Tom I believe are going to Bupshire soon & Wistar to the South on business so the house will be deserted  for awhile.  Katy & the childrenpropose coming home on 3rd day.  Frank came on to the funeral but went back last night, I am glad for him to have a visit there.  Emma Edwards fell in her house and broke her hip, she is now very ill not expected to live & her life is not to be [---] under the circumstances.  I had an active time last week attending meetings but got on better than I expected to, tomorrow is Phila Quarterly Mg & 5th day ours, after that I shall take a rest and do a little here at home, as I see many things that need looking after.  I dont know when Esther will come home probably in about a week.  A great deal of love to dear Anna & also for thyself from thy attached sister

   It certainly does not seem over two weeks ago that I saw you at Aldine, and I can scarcely tell what I have been doing with myself.  The Sophomore-Freshman debate caame off the Third-day of the week after I saw you, and so I was pretty busy preparing for that.  Unfortunately we lost.  It was the first thing the Freshmen had beaten us in, so we were rather sour.  Then the next night came the Entertainment for the Preston Boys' Club.  I had no idea of staying till the dance but go to talking and didn't get back till after twelve!  It was very good fun and I enjoyed it very much.  It is rather good fun to watch other people dance even though you don't dance yourself.  It was a success financially too, and we cleared $156.25 all of which, I am glad to say was given to the Boys' Club through Dr. Babbitt.  For a wonder the newspaper report about Emily Fox and the Biddles was true except that I think it was greatly exaggerated.  Detectives have been put on the case, I believe and they hope to recover at least some of the things.  I don't know whether they think they lost it or that it was stolen.  It certainly was mighty hard luck as I believe some of Emily's things were valuable on account of being heir looms. 
   
   Ernest's knee, I think is just about all right.  He can walk around on it all right but I imagine it is still weak. 
   
   The weather here has been quite warm and the snow has been melting pretty fast, but there is a good deal of ice over things and it takes a good while to melt that off.  To-day however is quite cool again, though I imagine it will warm up toward the middle of the day as the sun has so much power.  It sounds fine to hear of May days and violets and daffodils but it will not be so very long before we too shall be getting spring, for here it is about a third of  the way through March.  It certainly seems funny to think that there are only three more weeks of the third quarter left; for the fourth quarter goes by like grease-lightening.  I am glad I am not in Ernest's shoes. 
   
   To-night the gymnasium competition with Lehigh University comes off and I certainly hope we win.  Last week our team went up to Rutgers, and when the last event began we were several points behind, but we won the event and the meet by one point!  I hope it will be as exciting to-night. 
   
   It is fine to hear of all that Anna can do.  Please give her a great deal of love from me and tell her that this letter is for her too.  I suppose thee has heard of President Sharpless' illness.  He has not been at college for nearly three weeks, I think.  They took him into the Pennsylvania Hospital where Fred Sharpless  is one of the physicians, but he is better now. 
   
   Last Fourth day afternoon we had another festivity in the way of a Faculty tea for the Sophomores.  It was rather good fun, though I don't think much of teas.  They are too stiff and formal. 
   
   I think I shall have to cry a halt as my slender stock of news is about exhausted.  With lots of love for you both and thanking thee very much for thy letter, 
   
   Thy very affectionate son   Harold.

Title: 1905 September 5, Jamestown R.I., to Mother

Jamestown R.I.
   Sept 5th 1905
   
   Dear Mother
   
   I was just about to write to thee, in fact I started a letter last night, getting as far as the date,- when I received thine this morning.  I wrote to Mr. Wood on Sixth day and I suppose he has received it by this time.  It is rather a new experience writing to elderly gentlemen, so I hope I didn't say anything queer. 
   
   Art Brown arrived a week ago last First-day and he and Paul and I had a very good time.  Art is very different from the rest of mankind- he is so very anxious to please and writes letters at such an awful rate.  In one mail he sent eight or nine letters including postals.  Isn't that awful? We jollied him a great deal, Paul and I, too much I am afraid, but he was so good-natured about it that it was hard to know when to stop.  On Third-day, after we had been to tennis, Margaret Mellor asked us all to go out sailing.  I could not go as I had to play in the tennis tournament, but Paul and Art went and had a rather amusing time.  Then she asked us down to a marshmallow roast on Fifth-day night.  We were not very keen about going but nevertheless went and had a very crazy time.  In the first place the crowd did not know each other at all,- some of them were very gay and sporty while others were sedate and sober like myself.  Paul and Art spent most of the time having a marshmallow fight.  Eleanor Haydock was there (this was the one saving feature of the evening) and so I managed to survive.  The consequence of these two invitations wasthat we decided we ought to try to do some thing in return.  Sixth-day was Arts last day so we tried to find out what he wanted to do and finally decided to take a sail in the morning and the Ocean Drive in the afternoon.  Paul decided he would rather play tennis so Art and I went down to the Bay Voyage and asked Margaret Mellor and Eleanor Haydock to go.  I am not especially keen about Margaret Mellorm so she, of course, went, while Eleanor, who was staying at [---] Wharton's, decided she had better return and see whether they had anything for her to do.  We took three large fat magazines and managed to have a pretty good time.  In the afternoon we took the Ocean Drive and nearly died laughing.  The swells were out in force with their footmen and coachmen, and, as
Paul and Art were not much used to them, some of their remarks were very amusing.  They kept speaking to the different ones they passed and then went off in fits of laughter.  We drove back over the hills back of the golf-course, and it certainly was mighty pretty.  Art left that night and went down to Elsie Smith's house-party the next day.  Paul left on Seventh day morning on the nine o'clock train for Boston and went up to the White Mts (as far as Plymouth by the same train as we took).  He is at present at the Flume House, and I should not be so very much surprised if he came over your way some of these days.  His father and mother, Ellis and he are going to stay there for a couple of weeks and Paul told me that his father had been going up there for the last fifty years and had only missed about
ten.  I don't know whether this is true or not but Paul said so!  Alg and the rest of the crowd arrived about an hour after Paul departed this island (You say "departed this life" so I don't see why you should not say "departed this island").  Things began to move [instanter?] and the first thing done was a game of roof-ball in which Art and I defeated Joe and Alg most ignominiously after which we inquired if they could play marbles or any such game!  A little baby-in-the-hat was the result but unfortunately was interrupted by swimming.  On Seventh-day afternoon Jim asked me to race with him in his new half-rater (15 footer).  I accepted with great pleasure and went down to Whitall's to lunch.  Six of the little boats, all exactly alike, started.  There were two of E.D. Morgan's (one sailed by his daughter and the other byhis son) one of the Lippitt's, on of the Wetherill's and one sailed by Miss Grosvenor.  Miss Morgan did not understand the course and started off wrong, but instead of giving up the race she kept her nerve and came chasing after us.  When we rounded the last buoy we were third but were soon passed by another boat.  From that time on Miss Morgan and we did not follow the rest but showed our independence, and we won while she came in second.  I was pretty nearly as glad to see her beat the rest of them as I was that we won.  It was Jim's first victory so I think I must have been his mascot!  When we awoke on First-day morning a good old southeaster was snoring outside but we braved the elements and went to meeting.  Comong home it rained so hard that it went right through my rain coat,and rendered thy little Willie boy quite damp.  Second-day was still fine and wet so we fooled round the house most of the day.  In the morning we read a couple of Kenneth Grahame's "Dream Days" stories, and they certainly are pretty good.  We also read a crazy story by Paul [---] entitled "Love Will Find a Way" and "The Maltese Cat" by Rudyard Kipling.  In the afternoon we tried to take a sail but failed as Father had told the captain he could have a holiday.  However we went up to Whitall's and Greta and Alg and I went out  in a row-boat with a sail in it.  The little craft went sideways pretty nearly as fast as it did forwards so we did not get very far.  The rest of them went out in the rowboat and took a row.  This morning was cloudywhen we got up, but we had decided to go on a picnic over to Gilbert Stuart's so we did and before we had fairly started the sun shone forth in all his grandeur and we had a fine day.  I took Colin along and he behaved very well and seemed to enjoy it though he was pretty tired before we got home.  Altogether we walked about thirteen miles so thee sees we had plenty of exercise.  After lunch we walked back toward Kingston and got a good view of the country.  We had to hustle back to catch the five-thirty boat, but when we got to Saunders town we found we had time enough to eat some ice cream at a fair that was going on behind the hotel.  We walked over from the West Ferry and then Joe, Art, Alg and I took a short swim at Whitall's.  It is getting pretty late, the news and this sheet are rapidly coming to a close and I am tired so good night.With lots of love for both thee and Anna
   I am as ever
   Harold
   
   Please give my love to Miss Richardson.  Katherine and Jacquee say to thank thee very much for thy letter.  If any of you think of it you can remember me to the Leeds and the Hodges.  Tell me about the tournament and give my congratulations to the young Miss Hodge if she won.

Title: 1907 July 11, Chester, to Grandparents

Chester
   July 11th, 1907
   
   My Dearest Grandparents, 
   
     I have been meaning to write to you for some time, but somehow have not got it done so far, with the exception of one poor postal. 
    
   Well, we have been having the best kind of a time. The voyage was most enjoyable for there were some very jolly people on board and there was lots of deck-room for games. 
   
    Since landing we have had a good deal of rainy weather but we don't seem to mind rain at all, and it has not interfered with our plans except once or twice when we have taken the coach instead of walking in the rain. The cold too, for it has been pretty chilly at times, has been rather a blessing than otherwise for it has made our walks and sightseeing tours all the more enjoyable, and the soft coal fires have been very nice and cheerful. 
    
   Our trip through Devonshire was a great success, though we can scarcely call it a walking trip as we walked only two days instead of four. From London we went straight to Tintagel, arriving there Seventh day evening. The cliffs are perfectly magnificent and we spent most of First day morning admiring them from King Arthur's Castle which is on a beautiful promontory. Finding it was impossible to get our bags to Bude on the Sabbath we took the only course open and drove there,  taking them with us. It was disappointing to miss the walk, but we had the more time at Tintagel of which we were very glad. Bude was rather uninteresting, but the walk from there to Clovelly is certainly charmingly quaint, though the tourists have, I suppose, come in such swarms that it seems as though the place were artificially natural (if you can guess what I mean by that). From Clovelly we went to Ilfracombe by boat and thence we coached to Lynton. Here again we had expected to walk but were again prevented, this time by rain. Lynton and Lynmouth took my fancy very much, and Paul Brown and I had a delightful walk up the Valley of the Lyn to Watermeet (where the East and West Lyn come together)The next day we walked to Porlock in spite of the rain.  We were very fortunate, however, and each time a shower overtook us we were able to reach shelter.  The dark, low-flying clouds with here and there a burst of sunshine rather added to the wildness of Exmoor and it was not hard to imagine that the Doones might almost still be living in some of the wild valleys.  We saw a herd of the wild Exmoor ponies but were not fortunate enough to see any of the red-deer which we were told at Porlock are not at all uncommon.  From Porlock we went to Tintern by train.  It was a rather tedious journey with a good deal of waiting.  The two place are only about thirty miles apart in a straight line, but it took us six hours toreach our destination.
   
   Tintern Abbey is a fine old ruin and takes you back to the Middle Ages, giving the whole town an air of antiquity.  The little chapel on the hill, which they say is older than the abbey was also very interesting and we spent last Seventh-day morning (till train time) wandering around them and taking pictures of them.
   
   We came straight to Chester from Tintern, and I must say I was rather disappointed in it.  The Cathedral is fine but the Walls do not amount to very much it seems to one.  We left here First-day evening and went to Carnarvon where we were very much interested in the Castle which dates I believe from 1256.  At Carnarvon the rain again interfered with our walking, and this time it rained so hard that the coach did not run and we were obliged to go to Bedd-gelert by train.  In some ways Bedd-gelert appeals to me more than most of the places we have seen.  It is such a quiet little town, "far from the madd'ning crowd's ignoble strife," nestled in the heart of the Welsh Mts, that I felt I should like to have more time there.  In the afternoon it stopped raining and we walked down the Pass of Aberglaslyn where they say the cliffs rise eight hundred feet from the road.  It is especially fine now as the recent rains have filled the streams very full and the little brooks tumbling over themselves down the mountainsides are very beautiful.
   
   When we awoke the next morning we were again greeted by the pleasant patter of rain, but we decided to walk to Beltus-y-coed at any rate.  I am very glad we did as it soon stopped raining and it was a very pretty walk.  At Capel-Curig we again saw the king (we had seen him twice in London) this time in plain every-day clothes in an automobile, on his way to Carnarvon.  The people had gathered from far and near and greeted him enthusiastically.  I was interested to her them sing the Welsh national anthem in their native language, which is certainly most unintelligible.  This morning we returned here and this afternoon visited the Cathedral after which Arthur and I went to see Eaton Hall, the Duke of Westminster's place.  As he is now in London we were allowed to go over his house, of course for a shilling, (everything is for a shilling) and were very much interestedto see how he lives.  It is a most magnificent place, "rich but not gaudy" and somehow seems much more "fit" than some of the summer cottages at Newport, though I imagine, as far as money goes that Newport's "cozy little cottages" are quite as grand.  Eaton Park is a beautiful stretch of land about three miles (or more) long and the deer grazing in the open fields were very pretty.
   
   I have now come to the end of my letter, and as it is growing late I must close.  Please give a great deal of love to Uncle Tom and to Aunt C. and Uncle W and their family and keep a great great deal for yourselves
   from your loving grandson
   Harold.

   Dearest Family, 
    
   I have just been reading a very nice letter from Polly, which I was rightly glad to get. If you think of it tell her so with a great deal of love and many thanks from me. Then I have some more beautiful flowers to thank thee for,  Father dear. They were truly beautiful, and are still lovely though some of them, the roses especially, show their age! Miss Richardson thought they were packed better and seemed fresher if anything than the ones from [Waltemates?]. I suppose my attack of Grippe was the excuse for my having these, but I am afraid it sounded more than it was.  I dont think the doctor was atallsure it was Grippe, & if it was I dont think Ive heard of such a light case!  Thank thee [---] so much , dearie, for the lovely flowers and the letter that came with them.  I'd like some more of the last mentioned article whenever thee has time & feels like it but thee really mustnt send me any more of the former.  While we are on the flower subject, just pay thyself $5.00 from me, will thee?  I have moneyin bank I think, & my flower bill this month or lately will about amount to that I think.  I have been indulging myself by sending some to different people.  Some violets to Miss Stedman (who has had a cold) etc.  People have been so kind to me here.
   
   I havent got to the boys photo. yet, there are so many things to say.  I think it is mighty nice, & I am so glad to have it.  It is a little like seeing them.  It stands on my bureau & this morning I burst out laughing just looking at it.  I could just imagine from seeing their expressions the kind of time they had getting it taken.  Edwards expression especially makes me laugh.  Thank you all for it ever so much.  You must feel somewhat repaid for all your trouble, for it is so nice to have it.  If AuntLilly or Ellie have room I think I'd like some of my other photos.  Any that you can find.  Also my other belt buckle, if you can find it easily.  I think I had it at Conanicut.  It is a clasp & looks something like silver.  It isnt important at all.  If you have a copy of "She Stoops to Conquer" that isnt too nice perhaps you would send that too by them, ormail it to me later if you havent finished reading it by the time they come.  I just thought maybe I'd like to read it as you all are.  Oh & if you know where my visiting cards are I think it would just as well for me to have some & a card case if you can find one.  I dont suppose I need them, but I might want one for something later on.  I'd rather also like to have my black bloomers (sort ofsilk they are made of) sometime, but there is no hurry.
   
   I am sending thee, dearest Mother, something I started for thee last Fall, but have only finished lately.  I thought thy old one was pretty well worn.  I dont think I showed thee when thee was here the hound glass I got Miss Webb to get me as a birthday present from thee.  Does thee remember thee told me to get one & never did? It is a very nice one I think.  The usual shape & white celluloid I think.  Now I am talking to thee.  I'll just say one or two things I want to.  First Miss Richardson asked me to thank thee for thy message & to remember her to thee.  She is so nice.  Sweet & jolly- I think I am very fortunate.  Thee ought to hear us laughing over things sometimes.  Sheis young & ready for fun.  Then if thee thinks of it when thee writes to Cousin Hannah wont thee give her my dear love and thanks for the little book & the letter she sent me at Christmas.  And please give my love to Cousin Sallie too and thank them both for the very nice message they sent me when I was first taken sick.  I have on the table in front of me a nice fat looking letter from thee, Mother dear, but I'm afraidI wont have time to read it before I finish this, as I am going sleighing in a few minutes & the postman may come before I get back.  Thank thee for it though ever so much.  And thank thee, dear Ern, for thy nice one which came the early part  of the week.  It was nice to hear from thee once again.  If there are any loose pictures ofour house & Awbury floatinh around send those with the other photos.
   
   Now good-by.  With a great deal of love for each one of you, dear ones, I am
   Your loving
   Anna
   
   PS.  Please give my love to the girls & remember me to Simon if he is still with us.

   Darling little Mother, 
   
   I am going to begin my letter to thee to-day, though I dont think I will send it at once, as I sent one home yesterday, which I imagine thee will receive the end of this week, that is if they send it on at once.  But as  I am expecting to be taken sick to-morrow or next day & may not feel like writing.  I dont think I will do any [---] to begin my letter now.  I think I have told most of the news in my letter home.  Wasn’t it fine about my going in to see the pictures?  I think I will mail thee the catalogueas thee might be interested, & it is very prettily gotten up.  I am sorry that the pictures in the catalogue are not the ones I especially enjoyed, for I should like to have had copies of some of them, & the pictures in the catalogue are pretty enough to frame-  I mean the finish & all.  The coloring of the Blue Boy & his pose Iliked, also the coloring of the “Little Girl with Doll” was lovely, but I didn’t care much for them.  The Blue Boys [---] was an unusual shade of blue, bordering on green but soft & not starey & there were lovely shades of old rose in the Little Girl etc.  The ones I marked were the ones I liked, especially “The Elder Sister,” & the Romney ones,a dear little head by Bougereau & perhaps some others I dont just think of.  The little childs head by Gilbert Stuart I was interested in & rather liked.  I hardly saw the modern ones at all, as we had only about 20 minutes there. 
   
   Wednesday morn. 
   I am almost sorry I didnt finish this letter up some days ago & send it  even if I could say all I wanted to- for I shant be able to do that now, as I want it to go by this morning’s mail-  I have been unwell since I started this- taken just on the day, isnt it fine?- I’ve been as regular as can be lately- in fact ever since last Fall sometime.  But I must hurry up &say some at least of the things I want to.  I sent the catalogue of the pictures to thee last Monday, but dont know whether thee will ever receive it, as I directed it to Berkley- Thee put Berkley, Md, at the head of thy letter so I thought I’d try it & I put my address on it, so it will come back to me, I guess,if it never reaches thee.  I also sent thee the little [sagne?] & hoods & socks I have been making, thinking thee might like to see them.  I hope thy trunk isnt very crowded or they may not be as welcome as I should like.  I directed them to Darlington, I dont believe the little sagne would bebig enough for Edith’s baby, so dont bother about it.  Thee will probably be a baby some of these days I shall want it for, & the little hoods may be useful, too.  I’m glad to have learned how to make them at any rate. 
   
   It is nearly time for  the post man, so I’m going to say good-by & write the rest again.  If any one of the boys should want to know something to give me on my birthday, I’m very fond of Burne-Jones “Hope” & should like a photo of it, but remember only if they want to knowsomething.  I must finish in a rush & with a great great deal of love, darling from
   
   Thy little Daughter.

   Dearest Daddy, 
   
   I amgoing to write a little note just to thee, thyself, to thank thee again for some more lovely flowers and for such a beautiful pair of scissors which came directed in thy handwriting.  I dont know whether they are a birthday present or not, but they are a mighty nice one, if they are, and I am ever so much obliged for them.  They are perfect daisies & I have cut out a shirt with them already, for, my dear, I am making a dress!  A little [---] & I say, "making it," but Miss Richardson sews most of it on the machine for me.  It is great fun & I hope it is going to be a great success!  I shall have to show it to you when you come.Now about the flowers.  They havent carried as well the last two times, especially the last, & Miss Richardson and I both think it is quite likely because the weather is warmer.  So, dearest, please dont send any more, for I really think it is a waste to send them so far, especially when I am so well now.
   
   Daddy dear, I wonder if thee would order me a  picture at Staton's for a wedding present for Margaret Kim.  I should like to send her a photo of Burne-Jones' [---] of "Hope" in about the $2.00 size framed in a wide dark frame without a mat, like the one Staton framed for me to give Edith & Ben when they were married.  Very likely he wont remember, but it is not very important that just havent is done.  I'm going to enclose a card & if thee can conveniently will thee order one for me?  Her address is
   Miss Margaret Kim
   1735 Chestnut St
   At least I think that's the no. at any rate I think it is near enough-  Please give my dear love to Alg & Ted & thankthem both for their last letters.  I am finishing this in rather a hurry so please excuse everything and take a good hug & kiss from
   Thy little Daughter

   Dearest Family, 
   
    This is a poor way to thank you for all the lovely things I have had from you since I last wrote, but I can't possibly get 5 letters written at once! So I am going to take this way for the present and maybe later I shall get round to you each separately, I wonder if you have been wondering why my thanks have been so long in coming, but dearies, I have been doing so many nice things that letter writing got left. Please don't think I am unappreciative, but I know you would be glad for me to do these other things,for they seem sort of steps toward getting well. But I must tell you about my birthday first of all. It was such a nice one. I started it by reading thy letter, deares mother, which came the night before. I suspected what it was and [---] it and think was the first birthday greeting I got.Then in the morning's mail came thy lovely nightgown case thee made me and dearest. I am so much obliged for it. I have begun to use it at once and think it a much nicer place for my nighty than the closet where used to hang. It came in perfect condition in spite of thy fears! A book from Frank also came in the mail and I had a letter from him, too, later. People have been lovely to me and all the people have been so kind.Miss Richardson gave me a dear little stamp box, Miss Barnard (one of the patients) sent me a lovely bunch of violets and another beautiful bunch came for me in the afternoon from Miss Stedman . When I came up from dinner I found a beautiful Easter Lily with Dr. Stedman's card!, & the afternoon mail brought me a book, a lovely letter and Easter card from Aunt Anna in the shape of a little book of pressedCalifornia wild flowers. Then just before supper a hugh package was carried up by one of the men and caused a great excitement. It was from Boston and that made it all the more mysterious! On openning it we found a beautiful engraving of Faith Hope & Charity & a letter & an accrostic from Grandpa discolosed the giver- Then in the evening Dr. Stedmancame into the parlor lugging what he pretended was a very heavy box & I recognized Father's handwriting.  He & Dr. Shine opened it for me right there regardless of the dirt the [---] made which was pretty nice of them I thought, & didn't I enjoy getting all your dear things!  The picture is a beauty, Father dear, & I am so much obliged for it.  Then the books.  First of all "The Rivals"- it is such a jolly little edition& I am so glad to have it, with the list of the parts you each took.  Thanks dear Alg ever so much. Then The Cardinals Snuff Box- you've heard of it but havent read it & I'm ever so much obliged to thee dear Ern for it- the Boston Experiences- Miss Webb & I looked at the pictures at once & I think we may read it out loud.  The pictures are awfully cute &I imagine it's amusing.  Thank thee, dear old Squid, a great many times.
   
   But even this was not the end, for Dr. Shine informed me that two boxes had gone up to my room & when I went up to bed I found some beautiful flowers from Father & a box of violets from Aunt Carrie-  I dont hardly know how to thank Father for besides the lovely flowers on my birthday, when I came home from church on Easter I found a lovely lily waiting for me in my room from him, so that my fireplace now has an Easter lily on each side of it.  Thank thee, dear Daddy, so much.  Thee gives thy little daughter much too much.  The rosesthis time carried better for a wonder- Now before I leave the subject of my birthday- please if you see Grandpa will you thank him so very much from me for the beautiful picture & the lovely acrostic.  I hope to write to him myself, but dont know just how soon I shall accomplish it & I'd likehim to know at once how much I appreciated both the picture & the poem.  Then dear Grandma too.  I had a letter from her & I think maybe a book I received without any card is from her.  It is a daisy & is called the Oxford Book of English Verse- If you can find out whether she send it please thank her ever so much & tell her I am delightedwith it.  Please give them both my love.  And will you give Aunt Carrie my love & thank her so much for the lovely violets.  I think it was so dear of her to send them.  I may get a letter written to her myself some of these days.  I'd like to send my love to Aunt Anna too & thank her for her dear letter &lovely Easter card & oh will you thank Aunt Lizzie Brown for the dear little book she sent me as an Easter card & please give her a great deal of love.
   
   I'm afraid this letter may be too full of messages to be very satisfactory, & I cant go on & tell you about anything else-  about my going to church or Anne & Evelyn's visit or anything, for it is nearly mail time & I want you to get this before Sunday.  I am finishing it on Friday afternoon you see.  Give my love to them at Church Lane if you think of it & thank dear Aunt H for her birthday letter.Thank thee, dearest Mother for thine, which came this morning, also Ern for a very nice one written on Sunday& Alg for one written the Sunday before.  With much much love to you all, dear ones, I am
   Your very loving
   Anna.
   
   P.S. I'm so excited over something.  You may  be able to guess in a few days what!!!

Cottage Hotel
May the eighth

Dearest Grandma,
I thought thee might like to see these little pictures, although this place is too beautiful for pictures to do it justice.  You lose the height, & also the color, which is very lovely- partly because of the red soil & partly, I expect, on account of the wonderful lights & shadows.  Yesterday afternoon a shower swept across the water toward us with a rainbow in its midst & theeffect against a dark background of clouds was beautiful.  I know how thee would love & enjoy it all, & I long to send it across to thee.  The streams are very rocky & swift & the fresh delicate [---] of the [---] along their banks makes a beautiful picture.  The primroses are exquisite- so delicate, but I have not seen any violets like ours at Awbury!

Miss R. wants me to give thee her love.  She has thy little pincushion hanging by our mirror & we feel quite decorated!  Please give my dear love to Grandpa & to Uncle Tom & Uncle Hazen & Aunt Margaret.  Also to Aunt Anna & Aunt Carrie if thee should think of it.  With a great deal for thyself, I am thy very loving Anna.Lynton Cottage Hotel,A Devonshire Lane, Nr Lynton.Allerford bridge.Salisbury, The Close, Pretty Corner.

   Dearest Grandma, 
   
   It was dear of thee to write to me & I certainly appreciate thy doing so & thank thee very much.  Mother, Aunt Lilly Alg & I have already enjoyed thy letter & I will give it to Harold when I get a chance.  He is over near the polls this afternoon trying to get people to register, as this is the last day.  This evening he is going3
   down to Mrs. [Brabury's].  Thee knows he is to be an usher for Paul Brown next fourth day. 
   
   I am sorry not to have written before this to thank thee for the lovely visit I had at4
   Northeast.  I did so enjoy it, & you have done so much for us all,- this summer.  Thank thee very much, dear Grandma, & I want to thank Uncle Tom, too.  I am so sorry to have given so5
   much trouble with my ticket & hot-water bag! 
   
   Well!  the wedding came off yesterday, & in spite of the rain it was lovely.  Jac made such a lovely little bride, & Edward was beaming.6
   They had the ceremony in the large parlor right in front of the Mantel-piece this way-
   [illustration] 
   The mantel piece was decorated with maiden-hair & white7
   [---] & there were jars of white daisy-like flowers on each side.  Little Theodore & Brewster in white sailor suits & with little baskets of tiny white chrysanthemums stood on one side.  They did not8
   walk in.  Joe & Alg walked in just as we started the first hymn-  Dick is bringing thee a leaflet with the hymns on it-  Then Theodora & Eleanor came walking in with little Mary be-9
   tween them- all with baskets like the little boys- then came Jac & her father.  They all stood in front of the fire place.  The ceremony was lovely- Joe was fine & Ed & Jac were "dear"10
   & it was all so solemn & full of feeling.  After the benediction they all sat down-  I tried to mark where on the plan- & there was a few minutes of silent worship.  Then the last hymn & they11
   walked out.  They came back soon, however, & stood in front of the mantel to speak to people.  We all sat down to the breakfast.  There were 24 at the brides table- I will put in a plan to show12
   how we sat.  There was an enormous bride's cake in the center & this with white [---] & white china [---] as decoration made the table pretty.  The cake had a ring, thimble & piece of money in it & Jac cut13
   it.  They had no wedding cake.  They got off very nicely in Henry Scattergoods auto, after running down stairs & through the crowd & getting sprinkled with rice! 14
   I expect Dick will be with thee by the time this arrives & will tell thee about the wedding.  Please give her my best love & tell her I will write to her soon.  Please give my love to Aunt Anna & Uncle Theo. & Uncle Tom & keep much, dear Grandma, for thyself,
   from
   Thy loving
   Anna

London 7 mo 26th 73
   
   Dear brother
   
   I have been intending for some time to write thee a letter but since our arrival in London there has been so much to do and so little time for writing that I have dont next to nothing in that line-  And now what shall I tell thee about for between Chellie and Tom both of whom have written I feel as if there was nothing left for me to say-  On fifth day last we went to the Zoological Garden and I do wish thee could have been along, we were very much amused as well as interested-
   
   The first thing that struck us in particular was the storks.  With their long legs (only one of which they stand upon at a time) their necks which they draw well down between their hunched up shoulders, their grave or rather I may say melancholy expression gives them a ridiculous appearance and when they gyrate or give a great jump as they sometimes do with no apparent object it was perfectly [inesistable]-  The monkey house also proved a place of no small amusement-  as we visited it about 11 o'clock I suppose it was the hour for the old monkies to be taking their morning naps however that may be a number of them were asleep-  One old ape amused us very much he was taking a nap upon one of the bars and apparently the last idea that had entered his head beforefalling asleep was that it would be desirable to scratch his head so he would raise his arm until his hand nearly reached his head and then down it would drop, this he repeated over and over again-  In another cage there were three asleep upon one of the roosts with their arms around each other0  In other cages there were the usual pranks and absurdities going on which monkies indulge in. 
   
   The keeper of the laughing hyenas was very obliging and gave us the opportunity of hearing "the very remarkable noise" which the song informs us the animal makes every fifteen minutes"- 
   
   In the snake house every thing seemed to be in a very quiet state most of the snakes being coiled up  under their blankets-  One or two of the Boa Constrictors were tied up in sundry knots and laid out on the tree to sun-  We saw quite as much of them as we care to snakes not being our favorites-  We next visited the Hippopotomi and Rhinoceros.  The former are the most ungainly looking animals I ever saw.  There is a little one only eight months old and altho' so young its body so much longer than an ox.  The keeper brought some grass to feed them and made them open their mouths-  But I will stop for I am afraid I have said too much already about animals-  I think thee would be very amused at some of the servants we see here the absurd way they are dressed-  Not unfrequently5
   we see footmen with drab coats with brass buttons, crimson breeches, white stockings, low shoes and with either white wigs or powdered hair-
     
   The other day I saw an old fashioned coach by an old fashioned coach I mean one driven in the style of olden time four horses with a guard who had a long horn which he was blowing as they drove through the streets.  I believe it is owned and driven by a young lord who having plenty of money and a fancy for that sort of thing amuses himself in this way-  He has men to attend to all the money matters and to the passengers while he just drives-  Yesterdat we went out to the Crystal Palace and spent most of the day there-  It is a wonderful place so much to see-  It is something like our Sanitary Fair was, if thee remembers that, only on a larger scale.  We went around until we were very tired and then we dined.  After dinner we continued out investigations visiting amongst other things the "[---] animals"- These are large creatures made to represent what they suppose some of the extinct species were like-  They are placed about among the trees and on the edge of one of the lakes in natural positions but it struck us there was a good deal of humbling about it-  One sixth day evening last Tom, Rueben, & I went to Parliament-  We couldnot get seats for Chellie and H as they told us they were often engaged a week ahead in the ladies gallery-  We had rather an amusing experience-  We reached the hall about five minutes of nine and were told we would have to wait for a few minutes as the  House was just being made up.  We were seated with a number of others upon benches in the Hall and after waiting for sometime the first was told it might go in and then the second-  We passed up a long flight of stairs and went into a little toom where our tickets (which Tom had purchased from a man in the afternoon) were examined we were in a bitter trepidation while this was going on as we did not know whether they were good for anything or not, however they passed us- As soon as weentered the gallery the janitor came to us and pointed us to seats into which we sank he then told us we must park our hats under the seats, then he turned to another man and told him he must not raise up to see, then he made another man put his umbrella upon the seat behind him not allowing him to hold it in his hand so if he had ordered us to pull off our shoes I should not have been surprised- We heard three or four speeches upon the Army bill and were very much amused-  Every once in a while the speakers would get rather muddled and there would come a succession of aws and grunts and hesitations which was absurd-  And then there were occasional mysterious sounds which at9
   last we discovered was applause in the shape of hear! hear!-  How they made such sounds I dont know it was a kind of mingled mumble and rattle it put me in mind of the child that swallowed the bead necklace-  We stayed until nearly half past eleven and then concluded we had got nearly two shillings worth and would go. 
   
   This morning we went to Westminster meeting and were not a little surprised upon going into see Chas & Anna Sharples and their daughter-  After meeting we had quite a talk with them and learn that they are going to sail on the second of next mo:-  They have visited Vienna Switzerland France &c [---] trip ideed-  We also met Wm Bradford (the Artist) who is spending the summer in London) he was very kind and invited us to come to his studio-  Bevan Braithwaite was at meeting and pressed us to come and see him when we return a very warm hearted Friend.  We expect to leave tomorrow for the north-  Tell mother we are all pretty well-  Please give a great deal of love to father and mother and each one of brothers & sisters.  Tell them none must feel slighted when letters are not addressed to them individually for all our letters are intended for all.  Please give love to them at Uncle Johns & Toms also at School Lane.  Chellie joins me in message of love.  Please excuse this writing as I am using a quill pen which writes better on this paper than a steel one-  With much love I am thy affectionate brother

   My dear Mother
   
   Altho I have written to father and Tom has also written a long letter so that I am afraid they will be as uninteresting as "twice-told tales" yet I am going to send thee a few lines in a scrappy way for they own edification. We do so enjoy having Tom with us and he seems to be not only enjoying himself but improving--when he first joined us at London he looked very badly not having recovered from the sea voyage I suppose he was very pale and thin, but has been gaining pretty steadily so that now his cheeks have quite a color and he looks fuller in the face than I ever remember to have see him--I do not think his leg troubles him much, as he says it does not hurt him, and he walks about a good deal--we shall try to keep him from doing too much--
   
   I think Chellie seems stronger than when we left home, as she is certainly able to walk more and does not get as fatigued as she would at home--
   
   She has gained some flesh but is not what you would call stout yet. For a day or two her throat has been a little swelled, but I shall get her some [tannin?] or a gargle and I think that will relieve her. I have written [---] particularly in regard to health as I know thee would like to know. The weather except a few days in London has been cool so that we have generally not been able to wear our [thin?] clothes. Chellie has not found her waterproof dress to wear for traveling and now that we are going north shawls are called into acquisition. Evening 9.05. I wish thee could look in upon us this evening and see how snugly we are fixed, seated around a centre table in our cosey little parlor with four candles burning upon on the table and at this point Tom came in and proposed we should take a row upon the lake in the moonlight and as it was a lovely evening we went and now have just returned--I did wish for some of the girls form Awbury for it was so perfectly beautiful that even the [staid manied?] people almost grew sentimental--The lake was just rippled by the gentle wind and the moon was hanging over the western mountains throwing a silvered path across the water, and on the shores we could dimly see the outlines of Wray Castle and the pretty residences with which the shores are studded, and in which the lights were brightly shining. The rain which continued most of the day stopped toward evening and although the roads were rather muddy we started out for exercise and had a pleasant walk of three miles toward Bowness. [---] tt has cleared we expect to start early tomorrowmorning for Keswick. As this letter is for thy information on little points in travels I will tell thee of our general hours. We find it suits us best not to dine later than three or half past and so whether we take our dinner at the hold or elsewhere try to have it at that hour. We breakfast generally at half past eight and then take tea at half past seven or eight and spend our evening in our sitting room either writing home or in journals or in talking over the scenes of the day and planning for the morrow. In traveling we generally manage to have a car to ourselves and Reuben looks after the baggage and Tom eitherkeeps him or assists Chellie and H, while I am buying our tickets-  We get along very nicely indeed-  In the last letters thee said that some of them at home thought "thee was writing too much", I hope thee will not stay thy hand on that account, but only as thy strength will warrant, for I can assure thee every detail of home news is very interesting-  We think of you very very often and I hope the time may come when thee will enjoy the beauties which we are visiting, but altho the present is so full of enjoyment the future (when we shall return to your midst) looks very pleasant.
   
   The little books dear mother, which thee gave us just before leaving are our constant compantions in our travels and it is pleasant to think as we read them morning and evening that thee too has them and altho the time may be different yet we read them the same day-  I enclose a little bunch of wild flowers which I picked while visiting Swarthmore part of them I gathered at the meeting house and part from the Hall, I wish they were better preserved but they were pressed under difficulties in my pocketbook and I had to arrange them for pressing as we walked.  I send them thinking thee might like a little memento of Swarthmore-  I am afraid this will prove a scrappy letter and rather uninteresting for it is madeup of little nothings-  Hannah desires her love to thee and the rest of the Awbury family-  When thee sees them at School Lane please give them my love also a great deal to all at home and at Uncle Toms and Uncle John's, Chellie has retired or would join me in these messages-  With much love I am thy loving son
   J.Evans.
   P.S.  I dont know if any mention has been made of how Reuben is and as his father and mother were rather anxious about him when we left, will thee tell them that I think he is much better, but would improve faster if he took more rest especially in writing his letters and journal as he often sets up late and is up early-

   My dear Mother
   
   I hope this evening that no one has written home for a day or two and know thee will like to hear often so I will send a few lines this evening before the mail closes.  We have had a very warm day the thermometer standing at 83 [degrees] a good deal of the time and there has been very little air stirring-  This morning Mary, Alexis Alf, John Hazen and Henry made an excursion to the top of Kate's Mountain.  They had an early breakfast and got off about 8 oclock and did not get back until nearly one.  They had a pretty rough scramble and some how did not get to the right place and so missed the view-  I was glad they went as they thought it paid and I am afraid they find it rather monotonous-  The life is a very lazy one and while it is so warm in the middle of the day there is very little to be done in the way of excercize, with any comfort-  I think Alf seems better and the water suits him but Hazen is not able to drink the sulphur water and does not seemed to have impreoved as much as I hoped he would-  I do not mean that he is sick but he still looks pale.  He seems bright and much less nervous than when he left home and I hope he will improve more after his return-  Lily has bathed twice (yesterday and today) having her bath at about 100 [degrees] and says she thinks it suited her for after lying down she felt refreshed and better-  but of course it is too soon for there to be much change-  She stayed in the first day only about 2 minutes and today 5 so thee sees she is feeling her way.
   
   This afternoon Lily and Alexis took a drive-  I have been disappointed 3
   in the air here it is not bracing at all-  and as the mountains are all around us often we get but little breeze-
   
   The daily routine of our life here is not thrilling-  We rise about half past seven and it is often half past eight before we get assembled at the breakfast table-  After breakfast (which we rarely get through until quarter past nine) we walk around the grounds for a little while visiting the spring, Japanese Store, Post Office &c and then spend the time until 11 o'ck (when we bathe) either in reading, writing or talking-.  After the bath we put in the time as best we may until dinner time 2 O'clk.  After dinner we set out under the trees upon the lawn or upon our piazza and read aloud or talk until tea time and after tea we generally take a walk and then sit in the parlor until bedtime "and thus our days go on, go on"  The boys vary it occasionally by a little walk upon their own account or by going swimming or sometimes we roll a game of ten pins-  I have gone very much into details and I have no doubt father and Tom will laugh at the letter and groan over such a life (so do I) but I thought these little nothings would interest thee and moreover there is very little else to tell-  Our movements in the future are very uncertain and as yet we cannot say when we shall home or whether some will remain- as soon as some conclusion is arrived at we will let you know.  Please give a great deal of love to father Tom Anna & Carrie in which Chellie would join me if she knew I was writing but I am in the gentlemans writing room and she does not know of it-  With much love for thyself I am thy loving son J.

Title: 1875 November 28, Church Lane, to brother

Church Lane 11 mo 28. 75
   
   My dear brother
   
   Having received a message from thee through a letter to Tom, and not being able to plead sickness as a reason for not writing, I am going to send thee a greeting-  Well we are not going to see thee until next spring, it seems a long time, and we were all of us not a little disappointed when the news came.  We were counting the days until the time when thee was to sail and beginning to speculate upon the probable length of the passage, when suddenly all our hopes were dashed-  I was going to say I would not flatter thee by telling thee what lamentations there were on the part of some of us, but I think it does no one harm to know how much they are loved and missed at home, on the contrary I think  to a young man it does good, tending perhaps to keep him out of some things by which he might otherwise be tempted-  Now for the scrape of news I can glean up-  Last fourth day Tom and I drove over to Haverford to bring away thy [chattels?]-  We arranged to go on third day, but on that day we had a regular old fashioned Nor'easter and it poured most of the day-  The next morning about nine oclock Tommy appeared at our house in the [---] with Lady and Eric (Harry having been laid up some time with sore feet) after getting some more warm wraps for it had cleared off quite cold when we started-  The roads were in a pretty miserable state of muddiness and as we undertook to go by the Lancaster road we almost stuck so to speak-  However we reached the College about half past eleven, and finding the students in recitation we went up stairs and explored-  We found all thy things had been moved out of thy room and were locked up in another closet of which the matron hadkey so she had to be hunted up-  We packed most of the books and some other things in a drawer which Tommy and I carried down to the front door Tommy saying it was "like carrying down a little coffin"-  We donated to Frank Haines a bottle of eye wash, a little bottle of carbolic acid and a few other valuables?-  Thus were the last rites performed-  We packed the books in the bottom of the wagon, and put the precious articles, around with we supposed tender associations ( clung , (a broken fan with names thereon &c) between folds of the down cover-  We drove home to dinner reaching Awbury about quarter of four-  We had a good laugh at Tom - one of the objects over was to bring home the hanging book shelf and we forgot all about it, and came home without it - which rankled in Tommy's breast-  By the way talking of Haverford does thee know they have raised a sufficient amount of money to enable them to build, and Samuel Alsop Jr told me it was decided to go ahead-  The day we werethere was the day before Thanksgiving day, and as I waited upstairs in the entry while Tom was hunting up the Matron I was amused at two of the students, one was in the hall down stairs and as the other came out I suppose from recitation - he announced the fact that they were going to have Turkey for dinner, whereupon there went up such a howl of rejoicing as almost upset me-  We hoped while at Haverford to have had time to have called upon Margaret Yarnall, but we spent to much time at Any Marys that we had not time.  I suppose you have heard that Ellis and M Yarnall are boarding at [---] during the Winter.  I am glad to hear they are vert comfortably fixed-  It seems an out of the way kind of place for them, a good deal away from most of the latter's friends, I should think she would long to have her daughter with her.  I do feel for them very much-  First day 12/5.  A week, my dear Afred, has passed since I commenced this letter yet it is not finished.5
   During the week we have been pained from day to day to hear of Uncle Alfred's increasing illness.  As early as the beginning of the week Dr Wister said he seemed to be failing, and on second day they telegraphed for James, they received an answer the next morning only saying "will come" and that is all they have heard.  Up to second day Uncle Alfred has been able to get over into the library, this he has accomplished with the aid of a man who has been staying with him at night for a number of weeks- assisting him to dress and undress.  One second day he was so much weaker that he had to remain in bed- and since then he has been gradually growing weaker and weaker, until yesterday afternoon about three o'clock he quietly passed away-  He does not seem to have had any acute disease-  His appetite almost entirely gave out, and he gradually weakened - with the exception of a pain in one of his lungs I do not think he has suffered any-  Since last first day Uncle Tom and John E Carter have been sitting up with him half of alternate nights, the nurse sitting up the other half.  Lilly and Edward have been staying over at Fairfield for the last day or two-  Yesterday morning having heard how he was the evening before Father, Uncle Tom and Aunt Lizzie went over there, the Doctor came soon after they arrived and said he did not think he could live but a few minutes.  They went up into his room (except Father who had gone on to town) and sat there for two hours awaiting the close- he seemed entirely conscious but lay perfectly still excepting once when he passed his hand through his hair as his custom was and once he put his hand under his head-  They went to dinner and a few minutes after dinner was over he passed away, no one but Aunt Rebecca, Lily and Edward being present.  Just at the close, there was a short spasm and then to him all was joy and peace and rest-  What a wonderful and glorious change it must be for him after a long life of ill health and suffering during which I suppose he could never have said he really felt well, to awake inthat Holy City none of whose inhabitants can say I sick and where "there shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, neither shall there be ay more pain: for the former things are passed away"-  Aunt Caroline seems to feel it very much, not having seen for some time except a few days ago, when hearing how sick he was she went out to see him, but ut was thought best for her not to go in the room or let him see her so she looked at him through the door-  The only remarks I have heard that Uncle Alfred made (though he probably said more which I have not heard) were that some days ago he told J.E.C. "that it made very little difference which way it ended" meaning his sickness-  To E. Allen who visited home within a few days, and as she was leaving said she supposed she should never see him on earth again and that she did not doubt but that the change would be a glorious one to him he replied "I have been forced to feel very quiet and peaceful"  I think those were the words he used-  The funeral is to be next third day at two oclock.  It will be a great trial I doubt not to James to find all over when hearrives - 
   
   Last sixth day Uncle Tom commenced his winter readings and it was said to have been a very interesting occasion-  Neither Chellie nor I was able to get there-  There is a good deal of stir in our City now over the meetings of Moody & Sankey-  They have fitted up the old freight depot of the Pennsylvania RR so that it will seat about eleven thousand and meetings are being held I think twice on week days and three times on first days - they are largely attended and from accounts some of them must be impressive.  I hope they may do good-
   
   I suppose Mother in her weekly letter told you that Hazen had sprained his ancle, turned it under him as he was rushing out of the side door to catch the train-  Tommy seems to think it was a mercy he sprained it as it will probably save him from something worse if he will only take warning.  He had to hold it up for nearly a week.  However he is about again now tho he says it feels weak.  Aunt Lizzie Brown is still down at Atlantic City where she has been for some 9
   weeks and from accounts does not seem much better.  Aunt Fanny went down last third day taking with her a maid to stay with aunt Lizzie-  I am afraid her sickness is a pretty serious one and not to be gotten over in a hurry.  The rest of them at Grandfathers are pretty well now-  Grandfather has had a cold but is better-  Aunt Martha Leeds I suppose you have heard is at the Frankford Asylum, and from last accounts was not much better in her mind and was also very sick with [---] in her head-  I dont know whether thee has heard or not that the new building at Haverford is to go up next year they having got enough subscribed to warrant them in commencing so Samuel Alsop Jr told me.
   
   Lillies letter from [---] arrived on sixth day last and we were very glad to hear of your being so comfortably and pleasantly fixed-  Please give a great deal of love to both Lilly and Alexis and tell them I often think of them both with much affection and truly it does seem a long long time since we parted with them.  I do hope the stay will do you all a great deal of good-  I am afraid you have missed some of our letters Chell and I both misunderstood and have been directing our letters to Brown-Shipley & Co Liverpool - and I am afraid they have not forwarded them-  I wrote not long ago a letter to thee and one to Lilly and Alexis enclosing a photograph of the baby to each-  If they have never come to hand I will send you another-  Harry has at last made up his mind to return to Minneapolis - he expects to start next fourth day.  I hope he will have a more prosperous time the coming year than he has had the last-  Upon looking over the forepart of this letter which I wrote a week ago I find I have mentioned about the building at Haverford in that so thee will please excuse my telling it again-  I dont feel like rewriting the letter-  Chell sends her love to you all in which I join and wish you "a merry Christmas" and "a happy New Year"-  I remain thy
   loving brother

   My dear little daughter -
   
   Papa thinks very often of thee and would like to see thee very much - Mama told me in a letter she wrote that thee foes in bathing every day-  Isnt it fun?  When I was a little boy I used to go in bathing with my papa and thought it was great fun -  I used to climb up on his shoulder and hold on to his head and then the waves would not wash over me much-  I wish I was at Newport and then thee could go in with me and climb up on my shoulder-  I send thee some flowers that I picked out of thy garden this morning - I am afraid they will not look very nice when they get to thee, but maybe the sea air will freshen them up.  Give my love to Aunt Anna and Aunt Carrie and tell them I would like to see them very much.  Give my love to Aunt Mary and Cousin Anna.  It has been very hot here and I am very glad thee and brother Algie have not been here but have been where it is cooler.
   
   Grandpa has been sick - he has had a stiff back and when he sat down in a chair it Uncle Alfred and papa to help him up.  He is better now and can get up himself.  Will thee give little brother a kiss for me.  I hope thee is a very good little girl and does what Mama and Annie wants thee to.  I am going to send thee with this a picture of a little bunch of flowers and thee can see which thee thinks is the prettiest the real flowers or the picture.
   And now farewell my dear little daughter
   from thy loving father

   My Darling wife. Altho I sent thee a postal from NY this AM for I am going to post a few lines the afternoon. I reached Philada about half past one and found the weather very different from Newport. The thermo. hanging by my side as I write standing at between 85° and 86° and the air somehow feels lifeless. I came away in such a hurry at the last that I forgot several things. Tell Hazen we need not have hurried if we had know for I waited nearly an hour before the boat arrived. I carried of the Post office key which I enclose herewith. I think sister Ann has my pocket knife which I lent her yesterday morning and either Algie or Edward has my [rule?]. These last I do not need and you can keep them until I come on or until some one is coming this way. I forgot to tell thee that I wish that bucket of solution of [copperas?] poured down the kitchen sink and then lit John put about two double handfuls more of it into a bucket of water and let it stand for about a week and then pour that down and put about a pailful down any week. I wish thee would call and see Truman Pickham some evening as you come home from a ride and ask him about the well and the drains I went to see him but he was not at home and he is at work except after six in the evening or between 12 and 1 at noon. I had not time to call again. If the cow you have does not prove satisfactory get Hazen to see what Ward will rent his cow for he did not tell me definitely and if he would take 4.00 per week I would take her if this one does not prove satisfactory.I do hope my dearest thee will take things easy. I am afraid the care will be so much that thee will not gain much and please do remember that it is my special wish that thee shall either have extra help or have the washing done out or anything that will [unnerve?] thee. I wish I could be on hand to help and relieve this. I do hope you are all well and are getting on comfortably. If I was only sure that the well and the drains were all right, I should feel much more happy. I hope they are and have done all I know how. I fully intended to have brought on two of those [Appolinans?] bottles full of the well water for Reuben Haines to have examined. I wish theewould send them on by the first opportunity. Please give my love to the two Annas and Hazen and with lots for the dear children and thy own dear self. I shall try not to worry about you but leave you in the care of our loving Heavenly Father who I feel has been and is very good to us and to whom we should give our love and thanks. Here are kisses for the [---]. 
   Kiss Anna
   Kiss Algie
   Kiss Edward
   
   Farwell dearest from thy loving husband,

   My very dear wife, 
   
   I am writing at home before meeting so as to take the letter with us to meeting and mail it. This is a very cool morning the thermo at 6.40 standing at 56° and although it has grown considerably warmer since yet it is still quite cool. Oh! my dear how I wish I could see you I do love you so. I feel quite anxious to hear how you are but suppose I shall hear nothing now until I see Tom--I had indulged a vain hope that somehow I might spend the fourth with you but there is so much to do at the office that I could not leave just at that time but I am hoping I can get off so as to come on the latter part of the week, but don't count on it too certainly but I will if I anyhow can. They want me to spend the fourth down in Maryland and I think I shall although it will hardly pay as I shall not be able to go down until the 5 o'clock train third day evening or early fifth day morning. I enclose a letter I received from Kate this morning it came enclosed in one to Madgie. I do hope you are getting along comfortably and are all well--give my love to the family. I paid John's wife the $25 yesterday. Thee can tell him that they were all well.Mother had a postal yesterday from aunt E. Brown she is still at the [Rigi?] something and expects to stay there all summer she seemed in good spirits. I am ashamed to say that I have not been over to call upon the Newhalls yet but from reports they are very much pleased with the place. There mother seems stronger and sleeps better. I am afraid dearest my letters are very stupid- writing every day there is not much chance for a collection of news but then thee knows each one contains any quantity of love and sympathy and dearestI feel that we are growing nearer and dearer to each other all the time and it is such a comfort. Margaret is still at Awbury but expects to go home tomorrow-morning. The carriage has just come up so I must bring this to a sudden pull up.
   
   With dear love to the children and lots for thyself I am dearest they loving husband

   Anna and Hazen arrived home yesterday in good condition and as Anna wrote to mother yesterday I will not go into details of the journey or arrival.  They were however the [---] of various testimonials of love to me so that I feel quite rich.  Dear little children how sweet it was of them, however I am going to write each of them a letter either today or tomorrow.  I am ever so much obliged dearest for thy letter-  I am so glad to hear that Algie seems so much better and hope he will continue to improve-  I am glad thee is not pressing the Cod Liver oil as I am afraid it will upset his stomach and thus do more harm than good.  When thee writes tell me what the Dr thinks of his condition.  I am more and more inclined to think he caught the disease from Edward.
   
   We have been to meeting this morning and had sermons from E. Allen and W Kite and a prayer from Sarah Johnson.  The meeting was small.  We brought Cousin Anna Rhoads home with us as she was all alone-  Cousin James having gone to New Hope to spend First day.  Hazen and Anna expect to go over to Cousin C Hartshorne to tea this evening.  We are getting along very nicely dearest and thee need not feel the least concerned about.  I am really very comfortable and as to health am much better I have a good appetite in fact I expect I eat too much for my dyspepsia - which however is better - And now dearest I want to tell thee that I am sorry I said what I did at Newport-  I know my natural tendency is when everything goes along smoothly to settle down build castles in thr air and enjoy this world and I have no doubt that I need to be [---] more and more from this world and that our loving and merciful Heavenly Father breaks up my rest and [---] this world's pleasures that I may look beyond and have my heart fixed on Heaven and Heavenly things -  Our Heavenly Father does not willingly affect and if it only has the effect intended it will be but one of the light affliction which last but for a moment-  Therefore my dearest pray that I may grow better and better - I reallylong that such may be the case but the flesh is very weak.  I feel as our dear children are growing up I should be a better example to them -  So dearest do not worry about me but try and get well and strong-  I think of thee very very often with the tenderest love and pray that we may grow together in best things which I know will make us happen and happen in each other and in out Children.  Farewell dearest.  Give my love to Mother and Aunt Mary and the [---] abd with lots for thy own dear self 
      I am thy loving husband

   My very dear wife-
   There of 22nd felling of your accident at hand. How thankful I am that it turned out no worse. I have often feel anxious about your driving about but never thought of such an accident. Hope thee will have the [] fixed as the braces cannot slip off again and do be careful. I sent this yesterday by mail dearest a book which I thought would interest thee. It may be too large to go in the box at the Post office so thee had better inquire for it. I inclose herewith a letter from Sallie Simpson which I took the liberty of opening althought  I feel rather mean for so doing his thought thee would not mind much. I am very sorry to hear such sad news from Smith Hamson. As to Gip I think thee has done quite right. I think he is a "bad egg" and will never amount to much. And is not worth bothering with although if he turns up I think I shall bring him home and sell him. I am glad you seem to be having a good time and hope you are all well although thee fails to report in that particular. Is thee going to take Algie again to see Dr. Cleveland? I hope thee will be careful in regard to the children's bathing in the sea for I do not think it suits either of them very well. I enclose a little slip on bathing. Please give my love to Uncle H and Aunt M and tell them I hope they will pay a longer visit and stay over into next week. Tom Stokes had a telegram from Ellen at Catskills saying Lowler was sick and this morning Tom had a letter and Ellen seemed so nervous that Tom is going on. Frank however does not seem to think there is much the matter. Thy proposed to read quite meets my view but the propses it for 2 mo day night and as thy letter did not come until this morning we will have to make it 4th day.So let us commence the 6th chap on the new version on that night. Give my love to mother. I suppose Kate and party will be gone in this reaches thee. I have written to father enclosing thy letter. Wish dear love and a thankful heart for thy presevation my darling wife I remain thy
   loving husband.

   My dear wife
   As I wish to write the children tomorrow I am going to commence a letter to thee this morning finishing it tomorrow morning and mailing it on my way to meeting. I sent thee a hasty note by George and also sent a basket of peaches which I thought it a shame to trouble him with but after all the promises of sending one to thee somehow. And now dear I wish to thank thee for the sleeve button studs and Collar button they very pretty and thee knows from the way I size upon thy buttons I need some of my own. I believe or rather know that I have on at this minute a pair I gave thee. It is quite warm this evening a real August night warm-sticky  And sultry. Reuben brought me this afternoon the analysis of the water and I am very much at a loss what to say. Thee had better show it Dr Cleveland and see what he says it seems to me that if the water was boiled and filtered for drinking and cooking there could be no possible danger, but ask him. Dear me I am very sorry there has been so much bother about the water. I do hope you keep will and that you may be found to do so until your return which does not seem say far distant now. Alf and Maggie I believe send on word by George about their prospects. I hope Anna will be able to go on with them for she does not seem very well and Newport seems to suit her. Now dearest I want to say a word or two to thee about thyselfPlease do take can of thyself and take all the rest thee can. I wish thee had less to do or that I could give thee more help.
   First day morning. Well dear we are promised another warm August day. Fog early this morning and the thermometer now stands at near 80. I am glad you are out of it. We are all pretty well this morning I have nearly regarded my usual standard and with a little further can in my diet think I shall be all right. I am very sorry dear but I never remember the money thee asked for to be sent on by George. I will try and remember to send it on by Alf. I hope thee can borrow of mother or George so as not to Be entirely poverty stricken. My dear wife I feel drawn very near and close to thee in love and most ardently do I desire for myself that I may grow in grace and that we may be more and more united as a family and grow together in good things. I feel for myself that I am not near as good as I should be and I often feel quite discouraged. There are so many enormous within oneself to be drawn out. Wish love to the children and thy own dear self.
   I am thy loving husband

   My very dear wife.
   Thine written on first day and finished on 2nd day morning at hand thanks therefor.  I am quite well again only a little cold hanging around manifesting itself by a little huskiness in my voice nothing to speak of and I should not do so now only I promised to write fully.  I will forward thy letter to Mary F Brown as soon as I learn the address.  Yesterday I attended the funeral.  I went out home at 1:15 and we had dinner at 2 oclock and I drove father over.  he went to Cousin F Yarnalls to tea and I drove home-  Hazen drove over to Cousin F's and brought father home-  They funeral was very large- but I did not see one of Susie's relatives there but myself-  The services were conducted by Reverend Watson assisted by Dr Coil and F Yarnall and one or two other ministers were in attendance-  There was no sermon-  The hymn sung was "Asleep in Jesus"-  After the funeral I spoke to Cousin Elizabeth and Wistar and sent a message of love and sympathy to Susie-  As you may not have heard the details of the death I will tell you as we have learned them.  The cause of death was a blood clot upon the brain.  the Dr also found one on the lungs-  They (Chas [Wheeler?] and Charlie) were rather late for the train and were running to catch it just as they got to the Washington Markets Charlie who was a little ahead of his father looked back to see where he was and saw him stagger and then fall he was unconscious and was carried into the Market house-  A doctor was immediately sent for but Chas Wheeler died just as the Dr arrived.  he lived about 15 minutes after he fell.  The body was then carried to the Station House little Charlie going with it.  He had to remain with it until 7 oclock in the evening and attend the inquest and undergo an examination answering many what would seem to us knowing the circumstances [---]questions such as whether his father was drunk and whether he was a drinking man &c &c-  What a terrible ordeal for a boy 14 years old.  At the funeral yesterday he looked very badly like an old man.  Susie arrived about 7 oclock in New York and Charlie then joined her and they came on- when they arrived at Bryn Mawr through some mistake they were not met and Susie and the four Children had to walk home about a mile and a half at between 11 and 12 oclock at night.
   
   I believe Susie expects to return today to Newport.
   
   I am rejoiced dear to hear of your welfare.  The weather yesterday was very oppressive-  It was the most trying day we have had this summer.  Today is warm the thermometer standing at about 85 at a little after 10 ock yet the air is not so steamy- and by the paper I see there is a prospect of cooler weather-
   
   Please give my love to mother and I am sorry to hear she is not well hope nothing much amiss.  Give my love to the children and with a heartful for thy own dear self I am thy loving
   husband

   My dear daughter,
   
   I have a dear little girl here now to keep me company and whom I wake up in the morning one of the first thing I see is her bright little face. She never cries and altho she "puts other things out" she never get "put out" herself and where does thee think she came from. Why she came from Newport and the best of all is that anytime I see her she puts me in mind of another dear  little girl at Newport who sent her here to keep me company until she can come to me. It was so kind of her and I am so much obliged and when my own dear little girl comes to me I shall still have use for this one, but in another way. I was very much obliged too dear for thy nice letter. I hope thee has got quite well again and has a good appetite. I expect thee will miss Cousin Mary Emlen very much but then before long thee will have Edith and Esther and that will be nice. This afternoon we took a little walk around the place. It was too hot to go far for it has been a very sultry day. We have such quantities of blackbirds in the trees on the Avenue that thy make such a noise and disb that this week they are going to shoot them and see if they can't drive them away. Does thee know that Aunt Ellies's dog "Muffie" died the other night don't thee remember him a little black dog thee knows he used to belong to me and I gave him to sister Ellie. Write me another letter soon and give my love to Mama and Grandma. Try and be a good little girl and don't whine but be cheerful. With much love I am thy affectionate father.

  Aunt Mary received thy letter this morning or rather we did as we all read it first & then gave it to aunt Mary.  Cousin Charles & Carry & cousin Ellie Yarnall arrived last night or rather this morning, as the boat didnt get in till after 5 o'clock, consequently they were so tired that they are not going to get up till dinner time.  they could not get any state rooms & had to take berths so were very sick.  We took cousin Becky Howell & Annie out riding yesterday afternoon over to the three beaches & had a splendid time & got a good many shells, then in the evening we went out rowing on the bay with Eddie Howell & uncle H (the former makes a pretty good [bean?]) in the moonlight & sought the waves of the steam boats coming in, it was splendid, Lilly tried to row a little, but did not succeed very well.  Tell Aunt Annie I am going to get the story of the Haunted House fresh from Hannah Williams & Lilly or I will write it to her if she wants to know it very badly.  We were very glad to hear that you have cooler weather at home it must have been very hot - (pardonme, mamma) but it is only a slip of the tongue, I have in vain looked for hot in thy letters it's only "excessively warm."  Tell Hazen, Anna says she is going to bring home some shells to him & she wants him to answer her letter to him as soon as possible.  Aunt Mary sends her love & says she thinks she feels a little stronger though she don't attempt to walk far.  Anna wants me to tell Franky that some of the shells she is going to bring him are called boats & if he will put them in water they will float.

  Chellie received thy letter at the dinner table to day, but feels rather disinclined to write in the few minutes we have to spare before going to ride.  We had a fine South West wind yesterday and again to day so that the surf at the bathing beach was first rate this morning.  Charles and Carry, Elly and our party with two ladies from this house made a [load?] for the omnibus and we all enjoyed the sight and sound of the beaches very much, but Henry, Jimmie, Elly, and Lilly, were the only ones to go in.  they had a splendid bath they said.  H. unfortunately is deaf in one ear since and does not feel quite well so I doubt their going in tomorrow unless C. escorts them - and he has the rheumatism - Charly thinks Newport air is all sufficient without bathing.-  H. says I have no time to write as the carriage will be here.  Chelly is quite well, and all the rest.  aff thy sister Mary

Aunt Mary sends her love & says she thinks she feels a little stronger though she don't attempt to walk far.  Anna wants me to tell Franky that some of the shells she is going to bring him are called boats & if he will put them in water they will float.  Love to papa, Alfred, Nannie & all at home & believe me thy loving daughter
  Chellie 2nd day
  
  Dear Sister-
  Chellie received thy letter at the dinner table to day, but feels rather disinclined to write in the few minutes we have to spare before going to ride.  We had a fine South West wind yesterday and again to day so that the surf at the bathing beach was first rate this morning.  Charles and Carry, Elly and our party with two ladies from this house made a [load?] for the omnibus and we all enjoyed the sight and sound of the beaches very much, but Henry, Jimmie, Elly, and Lilly, were the only ones to go in.  they had a splendid bath they said.  H. unfortunately is deaf in one ear since and does not feel quite well so I doubt their going in tomorrow unless C. escorts them - and he has the rheumatism - Charly thinks Newport air is all sufficient without bathing.-  H. says I have no time to write as the carriage will be here.  Chelly is quite well, and all the rest.  aff thy sister Mary
  Love to Frank and the children. P.S. Dear Frank - In writing my review which is on hand, I want to make sure of a word I think wrongly used in the book review, and have no dictionary here.  Will thee please look in your Imperial Dictionary, - or the Text of the Iconographic (Anatomical part) & send me word, if found, in your next letter, whether there are not two words, ilium and ileum,
  and the definition of the latter, if,
  as I am almost certain, there are the two,

  1st day
  
  Dear Mother
  
  Aunt Mary received thy letter this morning or rather we did as we all read it first & then gave it to aunt Mary.  Cousin Charles & Carry & cousin Ellie Yarnall arrived last night or rather this morning, as the boat didnt get in till after 5 o'clock, consequently they were so tired that they are not going to get up till dinner time.  they could not get any state rooms & had to take berths so were very sick.  We took cousin Becky Howell & Annie out riding yesterday afternoon over to the three beaches & had a splendid time & got a good many shells, then in the evening we went out rowing on the bay with Eddie Howell & uncle H (the former makes a pretty good [bean?]) in the moonlight & sought the waves of the steam boats coming in, it was splendid, Lilly tried to row a little, but did not succeed very well.  Tell Aunt Annie I am going to get the story of the Haunted House fresh from Hannah Williams & Lilly or I will write it to her if she wants to know it very badly.
