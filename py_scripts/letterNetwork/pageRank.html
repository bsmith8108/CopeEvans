<h1>PageRank</h1>
<h2>About PageRank</h2>
<p>PageRank is a way of determining the importance of different nodes within a network. It
is currently used by Google to determine what are the most important websites on the internet
and give you the most relevant search results (Google uses other techniques as well, but those
are trade secrets). The way PageRank works is it takes all of the nodes (for us people, for
Google webpages) within the graph and finds who they link to and who links to them. Then, to
calculate the actual PageRank value of a site, the formula takes into not only how many people link
to you, but also the importance of the people that link to you. By iterating over the graph a couple
times, the importances of each of the pages becomes relatively constant and those are your final values.

Wikipedia article</a> on the subject.</p>
<h2>How it Applys to our Collection</h2>
<p>The Cope Evans family papers is a collection of letters that link different people throughout time
and space, to create a complex network of almost 400 people. Therefore, at a glance, it is difficult
to determine how significant any one of those members are within the overall network. By applying the
PageRank formula to this network, we are able to see who the most connected members of the community are
and their relative importance to every other member of the community. For this particular network, their
exists a distinct group of people that are significantly more significant than any other group in the
network. Because of this, the size of each of the nodes (representing their PageRank) had to be square-rooted
so that they would not completely dominate the network. So this means that if a particular node appears twice
as large as another node, it is actually 4 times more significant. Through this representation, researchers can
choose to focus on the important members of the family more easily, without guessing about whether or not they
are correct. Unfortunately the dataset is not complete, so all connections are not represented by this network, and
will be added on as more data becomes available.</p>
<h2>How to use the Network</h2>
<p> To select different members within the network, you can simply click on the node and the person's name will
appear at the bottom of the screen. You can select multiple people by either clicking on multiple nodes, or by
doing an area select, by holding down your mouse and then dragging it over an area of people you want to look at.
When you have the group of people you would like to select, simply click "Select People" at the top of the screen.
This will take you back to the main map, where you will see all of their letters.</p>
