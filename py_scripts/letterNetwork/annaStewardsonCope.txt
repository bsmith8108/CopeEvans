   To E.S. [Elizabeth Stewardson]
    
   At break of day the lark ascends on light,
    To carol his harmounious anthems there;
    And as he wings along the azure sky,
    drinks the refreshment of the dewy air.
    
   But weary soon with wanderings thus alone,
    He stays his flight and longs his wing to rest.
    And swooping from the hieght where he had flown,
    he seeks his tender mate and peaceful rest.
    
   So, stretching forward on his errant way,
    Man gives his wishes & his thoughts to roam,
    But finds at last his warmest brightest ray
    Beams from the smile of love that lights his home.
   
   E'en like the mated lark, may'st thou he bless
    To find thy dearest  joys where love shall lead,
    And in the quiet of the social nest,
    Enjoy the boon to kindred hearts decreed.The voice of Friendship hurls thy nuptial hour,
    and asks one [benisow] to crown the day-
    Even that sweet peace, which Earth the power has not
    Either to give- or yet to take away.-
   
   May sorrow never dim thy smiling Sun
    Nor sadness blight the garlands time shall weave.
    But may thy day in one smooth current run,
    Ambrosial morn bright noon and tranquil eve.
   
   Blessing on thee, and him whom thou hast choosen-
    May yours be here a love most truly blest,
    And when at last the stream of life is frozen,
    A love unbroken, in the realms of rest.-

I hope you are      all well, My cold is quite well.  Freind Mary Davis sends      her love to Mother.  I am glad to hear that Aunt Ann is so      much better and, I hope that she will continue so, and I am      glad also that thee is getting well enough to walk out  How      is Aunt Hannah and uncle Thos, and Harry  Where is Williams      slipers  I think ought to be done.  It snowed last night      there a little.  The green house is nearly finished but the      plants are not yet aranged. we have had some pretty good      sleding.  It is tirsome work to write a letter, Dan B Smith      give our class a lecture evry 5th day on chemestry and they      are [very] interesting and quite as much so I expect as      thoes that thee expects to attend  he showes us so many      pretty experements with all sorts of gases I would like to      have a kiss from Fanny  I will send her one down below  I      expect she had a lot of presents and pretty ones to  I      [like] Rollo very well and I have read it all through and      part of it to E Davis I send My love to all ofyou  I remain thy aff brother

I      promised thy little brother to add a postscript to his      letter, inasmuch as he thought he should be unable to fill      the sheet – but he has left me so much room that I believe I      shall have to call in William’s aid to clothe the preceding      page –  Thos. has been in the parlor for a day or two, in      consequence of a bruise he has received on his eye –  It was      occasioned entirely by an accidental blow from a stick in      the hand of one of his companions, & seem’d at first rather      disposed to be troublesome – but by a faithful application      of lead-water yesterday it is nearly recovered – so nearly      that it occasions no inconvenience, & is but slightly      discoloured –  He seems to think that eye is particularly      unfortunate, as it is the same one which was hurt some time      ago –  I do not think thy mother need feel uneasy about it,      as we shall try to take all necessary care of him, if any      more is needed –  In regard to being careful himself, he      needs some few cautions, tis true – but I will tell it to      his credit, that for an active, adventurous little boy he is      very well disposed to take advice – & when he makes promises      to adopt it, is, I believe, very scrupulous in fulfilling      them.  He has beguiled some of the hours of his confinement      in doors, by reading “Rollo’s vacation” to me – & we have      found it quite entertaining –  I think it arrived just at      the right moment –  So much for Thomas –.  now for Willie –      with whom I am becoming better acquaintedas the ice is now broken – & he frequently pays us a visit      in our parlor –  He tells me – he is more comfortable than      formerly – & that the cause of his unhappiness is re-moved –      what this cause was, I do not know – but he looks so      pleasant & happy that I am inclined to believe he is not      depressed by any great weight of troubles –  They are very      different boys but both have found means to interest me      warmly for them – & I think I shall not soon cease to love      them – Tom is sitting by me begging me to proceed – but the      end of my paper warns me that I may already have tired thee      – therefore will take the hint after desiring my love to thy      mother – and assuring thee of
the friendship of thy      affectionate

I      promised thy little brother to add a postscript to his      letter, inasmuch as he thought he should be unable to fill      the sheet – but he has left me so much room that I believe I      shall have to call in William’s aid to clothe the preceding      page –  Thos. has been in the parlor for a day or two, in      consequence of a bruise he has received on his eye –  It was      occasioned entirely by an accidental blow from a stick in      the hand of one of his companions, & seem’d at first rather      disposed to be troublesome – but by a faithful application      of lead-water yesterday it is nearly recovered – so nearly      that it occasions no inconvenience, & is but slightly      discoloured –  He seems to think that eye is particularly      unfortunate, as it is the same one which was hurt some time      ago –  I do not think thy mother need feel uneasy about it,      as we shall try to take all necessary care of him, if any      more is needed –  In regard to being careful himself, he      needs some few cautions, tis true – but I will tell it to      his credit, that for an active, adventurous little boy he is      very well disposed to take advice – & when he makes promises      to adopt it, is, I believe, very scrupulous in fulfilling      them.  He has beguiled some of the hours of his confinement      in doors, by reading “Rollo’s vacation” to me – & we have      found it quite entertaining –  I think it arrived just at      the right moment –  So much for Thomas –.  now for Willie –      with whom I am becoming better acquaintedas the ice is now broken – & he frequently pays us a visit      in our parlor –  He tells me – he is more comfortable than      formerly – & that the cause of his unhappiness is re-moved –      what this cause was, I do not know – but he looks so      pleasant & happy that I am inclined to believe he is not      depressed by any great weight of troubles –  They are very      different boys but both have found means to interest me      warmly for them – & I think I shall not soon cease to love      them – Tom is sitting by me begging me to proceed – but the      end of my paper warns me that I may already have tired thee      – therefore will take the hint after desiring my love to thy      mother – and assuring thee of

Haverford–
My dear Anna
I      promised thy little brother to add a postscript to his      letter, inasmuch as he thought he should be unable to fill      the sheet – but he has left me so much room that I believe I      shall have to call in William’s aid to clothe the preceding      page –  Thos. has been in the parlor for a day or two, in      consequence of a bruise he has received on his eye –  It was      occasioned entirely by an accidental blow from a stick in      the hand of one of his companions, & seem’d at first rather      disposed to be troublesome – but by a faithful application      of lead-water yesterday it is nearly recovered – so nearly      that it occasions no inconvenience, & is but slightly      discoloured –  He seems to think that eye is particularly      unfortunate, as it is the same one which was hurt some time      ago –  I do not think thy mother need feel uneasy about it,      as we shall try to take all necessary care of him, if any      more is needed –  In regard to being careful himself, he      needs some few cautions, tis true – but I will tell it to      his credit, that for an active, adventurous little boy he is      very well disposed to take advice – & when he makes promises      to adopt it, is, I believe, very scrupulous in fulfilling      them.  He has beguiled some of the hours of his confinement      in doors, by reading “Rollo’s vacation” to me – & we have      found it quite entertaining –  I think it arrived just at      the right moment –  So much for Thomas –.  now for Willie –      with whom I am becoming better acquaintedas the ice is now broken – & he frequently pays us a visit      in our parlor –  He tells me – he is more comfortable than      formerly – & that the cause of his unhappiness is re-moved –      what this cause was, I do not know – but he looks so      pleasant & happy that I am inclined to believe he is not      depressed by any great weight of troubles –  They are very      different boys but both have found means to interest me      warmly for them – & I think I shall not soon cease to love      them – Tom is sitting by me begging me to proceed – but the      end of my paper warns me that I may already have tired thee      – therefore will take the hint after desiring my love to thy      mother – and assuring thee of
the friendship of thy      affectionate
E.H. Davis.

I will now haft to end in good      earnest

Philadelphia 7th mo 31st 1840.
   
   My dearest Anna,
    
   When we last parted I had intended to fulfill my promise of writing to thee at a much earlier period than I have done, but my time has been so much occupied that I have found it impossible to do so, and trust thee will not attribute it to forgetfulness, as I can assure thee that although absent, thee is not forgotten. Several of the family have been very much indisposed, grandfather has indeed had quite a severe attack, we scarcely thought he would recover for a day or two, but he is now very much improved and able to be about his room. The weather has been so very warm, I expect you enjoy the country exceedingly there  are but a few persons now remaining in the city, the streets are quite deserted, great numbers have gone to Cape May and other watering places. I understood from a gentleman who had just returned from Saratoga Springs, that the Hotels there were very much crowded, about four hundred visitors at one house.
    
   I regretted exceedingly you were unable to hear Friend Gurney once more before his departure, I can scarcely realise that he has indeed left our native land forever, as he now supposes; there was a little girl inquired of him if he would never return here, and was almost broken hearted, when he placed his hand upon his head and replied, that "his docks were too grey ever to expect to revisit this country". I had several op-portunities of being in company with him and they were much more delightful on account of being unexpected.
   
   The First day morning before he left he attended the North Meeting, and gave us a very interesting and beautiful sermon, taking his text from the sixty third chapter of Isaiah, ninth Verse. After meeting Sister Mary and myself were returning home, when Friend Paul joined us and said, that she had fully expected we would have called to see Friend Gurney the evening before, that there was a number of friends and young people assembled at their house, between sixty and seventy she thought, to bid him Farewell, and insisted upon our going home with her; as she said that it would be our last oppurtunity, we accordingly accepted her invitation, highly grateful as thee may suppose. Our particular facourite E. P. Kirkbride was there when we arrived, and seveal other friends. Friend Gurney was very much pleased to see us, he said that he had been expecting us, and was very glad we had come, he seated himself close by us and conversed awhile very sweetly, after which we bade him adieu, wishing him a prosperous voyage and safe return, he sent his Love to all the family a kiss to the younger ones. He had an appointed meeting at the Arch Street house in the evening. (I was very much surprised a few days after to hear that you had not attended it). It was very large, he addressed us in a very interesting manner and furnished with a most touching prayer, in which he commended all his Endeared Friends, to the protection of that Saviour, who had so long sheltered him under his parent wing, and had been with him, in joy and in sorrow in this land."
   
   When the meeting had concluded, every one rushed to shake hands with him, I think he must have stood twenty minutesbidding all farewell, until I thought his hand really must ache however all were finally satisfied, and we had just returned home, when to our utter amazement who should arrive directly after, but Joseph John he said he must see us all once more, he sat a short time with us, and we then bade him adieu, although I trust it will not be forever. He sailed in "The Roseius" on the 25th, I shall be truly glad when I hear of his safe arrival at home, for surely his children and relations must ardently desire to behold him again, if he makes such an impression upon strangers what must their feelings be? I shall leave the remainder to thy imagination; I have written a long narrative about him my Dear Anna, supposing it would interest thee, if it does not thee must excuse the length of it, and not waste thy time in perusing it. I suppose thee has most probably heard of the death of Harry Collins, and Maria’s loss of her dear little babe, his namesake, so near the same time, poor girl she must feel it very deeply. Sister Susan and family have gone into the country expecting to remain three weeks. Cousin S. Cresson is no anxiously awaiting the arrival of her son Charles &c they intended sailing on the 25th in the "Great Western" for New York, I suppose they will arrive here in a week or ten days.
   
   Brother Wm is very anxious that some of us should take a trip through Pennslyvania, we had thought of going to Cape May for the benefit of the bathing the Dr. having recommended it for George, but Mama was so unwilling that he should be near the sea, we have concluded that a mountain ride, will perhaps be equally beneficial, I do not think it likely we shall be absent longer than a week. My letter has become so very lengthy, that I have only room to add do write me a very long letter and very soon, give my love to all inquiring friends of course reserving a lrage portion for thyself and hoping this will find you all in a perfect state of salubrity believe mestill thy sincerely attached friend and cousin
   
   Hannah S Vaux
   
   P.S. Please excuse all blunders and do not allow any one to read this but thyself. (A speedy answer Dear Anna).

   4th day eve
   
   Dear Sisters,
   
    I presume you started as you expected at 7 o'clock this morning and if I may judge by the coolness of the atmosphere here at that hour,  I should think that you needed your blanket shawls on the river, and now perhaps you have them on again pacing the deck of the steamer on the Sound.
   
   But I write now more particularly at Father's request. He wished me to record the uncommon softness and mellow tints of the sky. For the Sun after a cloudy day is setting perfectly clear & the evening is certainly one of the pleasantest we have had this season. Though probably more so to him, having just returned from his business in the city. We miss your company very much, but I have no doubt but that you will enjoy yourselves exceedingly and return refreshed as you expect in body and mind.
    
   I wil now close for this evening and making a short addition tomorrow I will leave the remainder of the sheet to Mary.5th day 24st
   
   Wistar informed Mother last evening that Mamaduke Cope went to New York yesterday in the early line. You must have seen him. He goes to see the English Minister Pease previous to his tour to Canada.
   
   I expect that you have by this time nearly or quite recovered from the fatigue attending your journey. Sue would perhaps feel it the most as she is so unaccustomed to travelling. We intend to send Harry to the city tomorrow and our family will then be very small.
    
   You must write soon as father and all of us would wish to hear. Perhaps you will trouble yourselves to note down some of the most interesting things you see and then you will retain them more fresh in you memory for our benefit, as will as your own. Please remember me to Cousin William. We are all quite well & hoping that you are the same & wishing you every enjoyment
    I bid you adieu-
   
   Your aff Bro William.Dear Sisters,
   
   William & I concluded it would be a good place to set you all example by penning a few lines immediately; accordingly I have seated myself in our old apartment at 12 past 9 o'clock, whilst the rest of the family are quietly giving themselves up to repose, for since your departure we have retired ever earlier if possible than usual, in order to give you an idea how matters work on School house lane. We feel quite impatient to hear how Sue bore the journey. I hope you experienced no detention in consequence of the [---]; we saw by the paper this eve that the passenger cars from New York were notable to come on [---] day as so large an amount of rain had fallen as completely to deluge the road. Our meeting at Arch st was so as very large this morning as it was expected the English friends would be there but owing to the lat[---] storm they could not arrive till this evening I supposed they are now in the city. Francis B was at Uncle Moses' this afternoon perhaps if Anna had been at home he would have done her the favour to have called but as he has now received information that she is not at home he will take precious care that he does not show his face in these parts for several weeks; he had a letter a few days since from Cape May.  the family are all very well and intend coming home in a few days. Frank says if they do not return by second day, which is the last day the boat runs, they will have either to swim or return by land so that it is most probable they will arrive by the the end of this week. Wistar spent this evening with us very pleasantly he says every thing is going on in the city as usual very few persons have as yet returned. Mother wishes that you should buy her a [--] de [---] dress in Boston. If you see any thing that would be suitable; she wishes you to consult your own taste in the matter. If you see one with a small figure that you admire get it or if you see a handsome plain one, not too light a color, something that would be suitable for autumn.  A plain one she would rather prefer if youmet with what suited you. Give my love to Cousins R & Maria and tell the former I regretted exedingly not having an opportunity to bid adieu farewell Mother and I fully expected to have seen him in the city and were quite disappointed in not doing so. I hope you will write soon and let us know how you are coming on as it is the only thing you can do to cheer us during your absence as the evening draws to a close I believe I must now bid you an aff good night. excuse haste.  if you either of choose to favour me with an epistle I will promise to answer it immediately and to some length.  your aff sister Mary.I suppose the Cousins R. & Maria to whom Aunt Mary refers in this letter where Cousins Robert & Maria Earle.  The former was very fond of kissing & Aunt Mary ysed to say that she always kept a pin ready to stick him if he came too near!  Mother must have been 21 at this time, Aunt Mary & Aunt Sue younger- Uncle Will came between Aunt Mary & Aunt Sue.  They were visiting Cousins in New England, where all Grandpa's relations lived.  At the time everybody travelled from New York to Boston by boat.

Newport 8 mo 10th / 47
      
      My dear Mary
      
      Frank has been writing to William this morning, and has most likely advised you on all points of interest.- you probably know by this time, that we are all in a good state of health, and we hope that our sister Susan is improving, tho' she still has some head-ache.  Frank & cousin Wistar are very kind and devote themselves almost exclusively to contributing to her comfort & pleasure in every way.  F is devoted to Susan and does evey thing in his power to promote the improvement of her health, his kindness is unparalleled: everything is done for us, and we have nothing to do, but join in the pleasant plans laid out for us.- Elizy H & Susan were concluding before dinner, that they accomplished very little of any thing on account of the time occupied in changing their dresses for the different labors of the day.- About ten in the morning they prepare for bathing or rather we do when Susan does not go-
      /
      not arrive on 7th day tho' we intend to do so if possible.  the Boat did not leave until 5 o'clock this morning.  I expect the irregular lately.- with much love
      aff thy sister Anne
      Susan will accompany us to Hazard's this afternoon
      she is resting since her bath.then return about 12 o'clock.  rest, until time to away for dinner, then about 5 o'clock, a different costume must necessarily be adapted for Sailing especially when the boats, are slightly fishy & a little dirty.- then we come home about ten-time or little past, and another change must be made to appear at [---] which [---] will suffice for the evening.- but all this is done in a good hurry and I cannot say it consumes much time.- I believe I have nothing new to tell thee, and indeed, I expect it would be very puzzling to think of any such thing when Cousin Wistar is of the party, for he writes home to frequently, and describes every thing that seems with so much minuteness, that if you are favored with the perusal of his epistles, ours must seem quite commonplace; this is my conjecture, as we joke Wistar & Sue both, about writing so often.- Only to think- Sixth day evening we leave, if a storm or fog does not prevent us, and Tom has concluded to remain, and return with us last evening tho' fog was so dense that the Bay-State" did not go out, and now we have every prospect, of the same thick state of the atmosphere for this evening consequently.  it seemed hardly worth while for Tom to leave before we did.- The Massachusetts arrived here with Mr. Williams on board, about 11 o'clock thismorning having been lying off Point Judith, even since four o'clock.  Susan & Lizzie went to bathe this morning with F & Wistar leaving me at home to pass the time as I could.  Tom & Moses had gone fishing, and I was quiet enough.  Susan though it best notwithstanding your message, to try the [---] three times faithfully as the Dr directed, and I hope she will not be any worse for it, and perhaps it may strengthen her afterwards.  She says she likes it very much while in the water, but she feels pretty weak for sometime afterwards.  we think she is the best judge for what is best for her, and she does exactly what she wished in the Bathing line; Frank takes her in, giving her three waves as directed, he said the water was very warm & pleasant this morning.  I quite long to go in again but fear I shall not have an opportunity of going more than once or twice more before I leave.- It suits Elizy Hacker exactly, she feels a little tired after coming out, but it seems to brance & strenghthen her, and shee looks better I think in this little time of our [---] here.  I do hope her father will telegraph her to remain with Sue, if the letter does not arrive in time to answer it before our leave.- yester afternoon we were out Sailing in the bay, landed on one of the [dumpling?] rocks gathered some sprigs of green to press, and enjoyedthe novelty of it highly, it was really very pleasant, altho' by the time we returned, our blanket shawls were almost white with the fog.  Sailing seems to suit Susan, very well, but I think clear weather as a general thing is preferable to her.- This afternoon we think of calling at fr'd Hazard’s, we spent a pleasant evening there last Sixth day.  they are certainly a delightful family. Ann[a/e?] Hazard called here this morning with S & A Jenkins who are still staying with them – we intend riding out to see fr'd Jenkins before we go.- 4th day morn.  I was obliged to leave this shut hastily yesterday afternoon, as Thomas Hazard & his wife called upon us inviting us to spend this afternoon with them which we intend doing.  Elizy & Frank are much disappointed I believe in Fanny H’s beauty, but they must see her at [---] before they fully decide.  She is perfect at home.- my love to all- Susan and Lizzie are taking a nap before dinner, and I cannot disturb them now.- there is a thick fog over they bay now 12 at noon, and it will [---] increase- Tom could not have gone last night in consequence of the bay as the boat did not leave, and perhaps it is as well for him to wait for us.  Frank & myself do not think it proper to leave here in a fog or storm and Tom must not think it strange if we do

[Letter from Anna S. Cope to her sister in law R.Anna Cope]
   
   Awbury 7 mo. 9th / 58
   
   Dear sister Anna
   
   Thee will think I am very remiss in performing my promises but it is useless for me to make excuses, as thee knows how time goes with me, generally, amongst the childrenm during the day, and by evening thee may imagine how it is that I feel too indolent to write a letter.  We are much obliged to father for his kind & sympathetic letter at this time and I hope we may be enabled to take the right view of our troubles, in this matter.  Much love to father and mother, and tell them that Francis keeps up his spirits very well, considering all things, he has received a letter from bro' Thomas to day, with Geo. M. Dallas reply to his (Tho's) epistle, which he hasprobably sent to Atlantic City for father's perusal.- it is short, very politely worded, and caps the climax for coolness, on the subject, as he had evidently not troubled himself about the affair in the slightest degree.- I must confess, I was completely taken aback at such cool indifference on the subject, especially as Thomas had consulted him before, when in England.  But I suppose there is nothing more to be done about it, and we must try to hear it with a Christian spirit as father does.-
   Elizy sends her love to you all & is in better spirits, than lately, as she has received several letters from Thomas, he is still in Brussels, and appears to have no very definite idea when he may return home.-
   We are glad father has sent for Julia to join you, as she needs a change, I fear she confines too lately to the attic, and a little of your refreshing sea-breezes will revive her.  I think she has been concerned about George, as he hasbeen quite indisposed.  He is now much better and spent this afternoon here for the first time, as the Dr. thought the ride might do him good, but unfortunately he did not see much of Julia, she having been in town, and did not reach home until near seven o'clock when he was obliged to go home to tea.  He says the Dr. pronounced his lungs quite clear now, and I hope he will be able to accompany Julia to the shore.- Hannah Stokes has been here to day, and intends staying over-night, it is quite cheering to have a little company as we miss you all so much.  Thy letter this afternoon was very acceptable, and tell Clemmy I thought perhaps she would have favored us again.  I am glad to hear of the Doctor having slept better and hope he may be benefitted, my love to sister Mary, and mention to her if thee pleases, that I have not received any reply to my letter to her, but suppose I am to get a bonnet for her at Jones' according to my best judgment.  but they think it is very doubtful if they can procure any other quality of [---].  it is not as fine as thatof which our sun-bonnets are made.  Elizy Hacker expected to have gone down to Atlantic City this week, but was not well enough.-
   Brother John has been here a few minutes this evening, Rueben is not entirely well of the poison yet, and they think he has the whooping-cough.  Our Willy has it now, also little Johnny & little Mary has it quite badly.-
   Our Tom is getting better of it, and Alfred does not cough now at all; Henry still coughs a good deal at night, as well as little Johnny.-
   Mary Mayer has arrived in the city of P- and will come down here tomorrow afternoon.  How does sister Mary enjoy herself, and has she returned to bathe?  Tell Clemmy I was not surprised to hear her opinion that it is not equal to Newport.  Sarah Biddle mentioned to us on first day last, of their having received letters from uncle Alfred and aunt Rebecca- and uncle Alfred is much better, thinks the hydropathic system suits him.  Bishop Potter’s family are still with them.  Thee does not know, how much I wished she had offered to show usthe letters, as she said they were long, and very interesting.
   It is past ten o'clock, and F- is shutting up the house affectionately thy sister
   Anna

   My dear sister
   
   When I last wrote, it seemed so doubtful whether thee would be at uncle William's or on the way home with Edward Biddle, that I concluded to direct the letter to Clemmy in case thee had left there.- Brother Thomas returned home very unexpectedly on second day evening, the very time we were looking for thee, he was much overcome by the voyage, and the anxiety of getting off in a steamer, but I hope is better now,and likely to improve; his strength has been much prostrated, and he has had some fever but the Doctor considers him better this evening, and he does really seem better, tho’ he is still quite weak.  They had a very cold voyage, and he could not keep warm enough & consequently took a severe cold, but thee must not be anxious or uneasy about him, as Dr Rhoads thinks him much better; &he is entirely free of fever this evening.  Alfred is also much better to day for the first time, but he has changed so frequently from better to worse in the course of twenty four hours, that we hardly know how to calculate about him.  But I think the Doctor is more encouraged about him this evening, and I have great hopes that he will soon be on the well list, as he has one tooth through, and he has not coughed quite so hard to day; the rest of the family are all pretty well, father, and mother desire their love to thee, and say thee had better take the first good opportunity to return home, and not to think of coming home alone, without hearing further from us; and Francis also adds that in case Alfred continues better, perhaps he can come up for the next week.-
   With regard to thy medicine, and salve, we will endeavor to send it to thee in some way, as well as the material for aunt Susan’s duster.- Bro' Thomas has bough various little articles for the children, with which they are much pleased; he bought Lilly & Chelly eacha suit of doll’s clothes made in Paris, according to the present style, hats shoes, and even night-gown and cap.  velvet [---] watch & chain, little [---] all furnished in the most minute style, [---], &c little beauties,- the children are so overjoyed, that they show them to everyone that comes, and do not get tired of examining them, at all times in the day, and I do not wonder for they are so elegantly made that you cannot help admiring them.  Sister Elizy and Julia sed their love to Clemmy and thyself, in which I wish to join, also love to Aunt Susan, Annette & Carry- I am sorry I have no news to tell thee, such as thee would like to hear, but as I have not been any where for the last three or four weeks thee must not wonder at it.-
   with much love affectionately
   sister Anna S. Cope
   PS.
   I am obliged to close this in haste, as it is late, and the family have mostly retired
   mother is about as well as usual now.-Tom continues to get better- whether I get up for thee or not will depend on how Alfred is.  He is a good deal better this morning.  I have Aunt Susans cloth which if I do not bring up I will send by envelope.  There seems to be no use of sending thy medicine as thee will hardly have a chance to use it, but I will bring it with me if I come. Dr Evans is not in town now

   Dear mother
   
   I wrote a few hasty lines to Frank this afternoon which brother Thomas did not succeed in sending to you, as the Germantown post-office he found was not open on First-day, giving you the good news that sister E. has another boy, a very fine-looking child, and the tenth grandson, but as yet without a name, which is not decided upon, indeed, I have not heard one suggestion, only it is to be a fancy name, and Lizzie leaves it to bro' Thomas select.  Sister E. desires her love, and wishes me to say to thee, that she is very comfortable, this evening; and the Doctor says she is doing as well as is possible.  The child was born at 1/2 past 7 o'clock this morning, and the nurse came about 9.  Thomas sent to town for her early, and she came as soon as shecould, but it did not make any difference as the Doctor thought Mary Sixsmith was entirely competent to attent to all that was needed, and she proved so.
   Bro’ Thomas took Harry, Tom & Willy to meeting, and afternoon left our two boys at father’s to dine, and went for them to return home towards evening.  The house seems quite lonely and deserted now, and company at the tea-table was very slim this evening, only three, Thomas, Harry & myself.
   Ellie Stokes with little Ellie left for Riverton yesterday afternoon.  Ellie ad been staying with us since 6th day morning.
   Sister Susan and Virginia also went home yesterday afternoon, they enjoyed their visit with us very much, and it was very pleasant to us to have them, as we miss you all so much.   The children have kept pretty well, tho' yesterday was an oppressively warm day here, so damp & close, but to day it is lovely, tho' quite warm.-
   I hope you are all enjoying the sea-breezes notwithstanding the hard beds, which must be quite a draw-back to thecomfort of some of you.  How is Anne?  Sister Lizzie wished me to mention, that she hopes Anne will drink plenty of [---] wine as it was particularly recommended to Clemmie by Dr. [Meigs?], at one time as being very beneficial, as it has the peculiar quality of enriching the blood, and he ordered her to take a tumbler full a day.  Lizzie thinks Frank had better take some more of it to Atlantic City for her on 4th day, when he comes up.  Please give my love to her, also to father, Emma, and sister Lizzie Brown.  Dr Rhoads mentioned this morning that Margaret Eliz expected to go to the sea-shore tomorrow in company with Augustus Wilson, and some one else whose name I did not quite understand.  I hope you may meet with her.-   
   affectionately thy daughter

My dear Chellie

As Dr Rhoads very kindly offered to take this note to thee, I thought perhaps thee would like to hear how thy little brothers are getting along at home and therefore take the opportunity to send a few hasty lines.  Alfred was very happy in a few minutes after papa and Willy & Tom left us; I went to ride with uncle Thomas the latter part of the afternoon, and took him along, we had a few errands to do in Germantown.-
Uncle Alfred & Aunt Rebecca Cope with Annie, called to see us yesterday afternoon and we had a very pleasant visit from them.  Uncle Alfred's knee is still rather troublesome, but his foot is better.  Cousin Edward is going to the WhiteMountains with uncle Edward Yarnall & Aunt Caroline, very soon.  Tell Aunt Lizzie that I saw grandma Brown at meeting this morning, she told me they were all pretty well except Ridgely and he was threatened with [cramp?] last night, but was much better to day, indeed quite relieved; they sent for Dr Rhoads who saw him again this morning before grandma came to meeting.  Tell papa that wonders will never cease, Aunt Mary Haines & mamma are going to spend this evening with Ann Haines to meet B Yarnall's family.-

in great haste
affly thy mother

Six years ago, when ever joyous Spring 
   scattered rich gifts upon this earth of our's 
   Far sweeter than the sweetest of her flowers, 
   One flower did God to our own garden bring. 
   
   He planted it a noble plant, and gave 
   The charge of it into our loving care, 
   To train it tenderly, so it might bear 
   Fruit to His praise who for such fruit I did crave. 
   
   Ah! how kept we our trust? Was ours the love, 
   Which while it prized the gift loved more the given, 
    And sought with tears, how is might best deliver 
   The entrusted talent back to him above? 
   
   Oh! earthly love, oh! selfish human heart, 
   Weak and mistrustful of God's providence 
   Troubled for many things of time and sense, 
   Yet careless of the one thing needful, the good path! 
   
   Therefore when God our ill kept graden saw, 
   And marked how weeds were climbing o’er the flowers
    So that the refreshing Heavenly showers 
   Might hardly reach them; gently did he draw 
   
   One flower from our keeping, it may be
    Not only to preserve that one from harm, 
But that our careless souls be might alarm, 
   And waken from their false security. 
   Ah me! How little had we dreamed of this
!    Listless, beside our cherished flowers we lay. 
   And as we breathed their fragrance day by day. 
   Looked for no pride awakening from own bliss. 
   
   In distant meadows could we often hear
    The stern old mower what his fatal sythe; 
   But yet our hearts beat ever free & blythe, 
   Since to our garden still he drew not near. 
   
   Angel of Death! Ah! who may ever tell 
   The bitter anguish of our souls, but now 
   No doubt can e'er disturb our faith that thou 
   Wast sent by Him who doeth all things well. 
   
   He called our flower Willie; twas a name 
   Borne by one dearly loved, whose gentle heart
    Waited e'en then the summons to depart; 
   And joyfully received it when it came. 
   
   And we had hoped, that in our brother's stead
    Our darling might be found by name & all 
   His guiltless actions, ever to recall 
   The cherised memories of the loved & dead. 
   
   Such was wour hope; yet may we not repine; 
    Twas matchless wisdom and unbounded love 
   Drew both our precious ones to him above; 
   To make them in His Heavenly courts to shine. 
  Now other names we trust to them are given, 
   In that blest land where our loved flower is growing. 
    The stream of life beside him ever ever flowing, 
   Which maketh glad the heritage of Heaven. 
   
   And now on this his Natal Day, 
   We humbly bend the knee, and pray 
   To Thee, who wast his God always, 
    God of all Consolation, 
   
   That thou our hearts may so incline, 
   So bend our stubborn wills to thine, 
   That we no longer may repine
   In our deep tribulation
   
   We thank Thee God, that Thou hast taken 
   Our Willie from this world of pain, 
   Before upon his robes the stain 
   Of deadly sin did cling. 
   
   And in his sweet simplicity, 
   That thou, most precious thoughts of Thee
    And of Thy Heaven, continually, 
   Before his mind did bring. 
   
   overSo, when thy summons to him came, 
   While suffering racked his tender frame, 
   The call was welcome, as the claim 
   Of friend long dearly known. 
   
   An doubting naught, his willing feet 
   Hastened the messenger to meet, 
   As one he trustingly could greet, 
   Who came to take him home. 
   
   Oh Lord! Thou gainest the victory! 
   Not unto him, but unto Thee 
   Let all the praise and honor be 
   Oh, Lord! our God most glorius! 
   
   Oh! In the darkness of our night 
   When we too wage the fearful fight, 
   May we be made through thy blessed light, 
    Like him o'er death victorious. 
   
   5th  month 8th 1860.

Thanks dear Anna, for thy many  kind remembrances; the basket of flowers was exquisitely beautiful, how they remind us of the skill and benevolence of the great Creator, cheer the path of life and touch the heart with gratitude to Him who has so bountifully provided for one enjoyment ever in his visible works.

I hope we shall get off as we expect on 4th day evening, as I am anxious to get home-we are all pretty well-with much love, and kisses to the little ones, affectionately      thy mother AS Cope

1st day eve

My dear   Mother

I had to leave off writing very suddenly last   time, as thee must have seen by the letter having no   direction.  We got to writing in bed at West Point as we   woke up early, & were not going to take breakfast till 8   1/2; but we had to go at 9 1/2, & as we were very pokey we   did not get down to breakfast till 9 o’clock-hence my great   hurry.  We left West P. in the boat, the rest of the way up   the Hudson was not however nearly so interesting, we soon   got out of the Highlands & then it seemed very tame.  This   is the most magnificent place we were ever, or are likely   ever, to be in; The view from the front of the house is very   extencive & beautifulfrom one place we can see the top of Mount Washington with   the opera glass.  The house is quite a large one tho’ mostly   old fashioned except the parlor wh. is up stairs, & has I   think most probably been altered the passages are the most   intricate I ever was in, & sometimes I feel completely lost.   We are on the very top of the mountain with dreadful   prespicise’s all around us, & it is the most dreadful place   to get up to that ever was, thee knows its a twelve miles   drive up the mountain from the landing, & how long does thee   ’spose we were getting up? 5 1/2 hours- just think of it the   horses walked nearly all the way, & stoped ever few   minut[e]s to rest; after we got fairly to the foot of the   mountain within about three miles from the house father &   Tom got out to walk, “& the consequence was” they got here   an hour & a quarter before us.the last part of the way poor Rach, was dreadfully sick, the   boat & stage together were too much for her, & as soon as we   got there I helped her get right to bed, she slept pretty   well however after she once did get to sleep tho’ she   suffered dreadfully poor child, thee knows her headaches are   so hard to bear, but don’t worry she’s quite well to day.    This morning they had service in the parlor to wh. Cous.   Clem, Chell & I went with papa’s leave. the sermon was   pretty good & I must confess I think it much better that   poking round all 1st day & going no where, if you can’t go   to meeting go to church – “thems my sentiments.”  After   service we all went out to take a ramble & after a good deal   of hunting round for paths & scrambling up them when found,   we at last arrivedat the top of South Mountain It was a beautiful walk   although it seemed to scare poor aunt Annie terribly to see   us so near the edge of these awful prespicise’s wh. surround   us every where; the rocks covered with ferns, mosses,   litgens are really beautiful.  We passed through what they   call “[Pudding]–stone Hall” a large cleft in the rocks   formed of pudding–stone & also through the lemon-squeezers   another crevise.  We are altogether enjoying ourselves very   much I think & propose staying here till 3rd day afternoon   when we will probably leave for Saratog[a], & thence to Lake   George.  at least those are present prospects but as we have   changed our plans several times to day I wont say certainly,   if we p[u]rsue the plan now proposed wewill stop at Belloes Falls on our way to Boston & spend   next 1st day at Nahant if we can.  We have rather a funny   time altogether about our meals & sleeping apartments here   things are not extremely clean, & it is so crowded we have   to come to the second table & therefore have to take our   breakfast at ten & dinner at four & now about 6 the supper   bell has rung, but I ‘spose we’ll come second class there   to.  We are quite glad of our thick dresses Mother, & have   worn nothing else hardly since we left home.  its right cold   to night, & we have to wear shawls & things all the time to   keep warm.  It is getting almost to dark for me towrite any more dear Mother so I think the[e] must let me   close.  I hope we shall hear from home tomorrow we want to   hear very much how you all are.  I shall try to write soon   again if we get to a stopping place  we have been going so   steadily that there has been hardly any time to do any   thing, but see the sights  Please excuse all defects – &   with love to all I am
ever thy loving
daughter Lily

  Dear Mother
  
  Aunt Mary received thy letter this morning or rather we did as we all read it first & then gave it to aunt Mary.  Cousin Charles & Carry & cousin Ellie Yarnall arrived last night or rather this morning, as the boat didnt get in till after 5 o'clock, consequently they were so tired that they are not going to get up till dinner time.  they could not get any state rooms & had to take berths so were very sick.  We took cousin Becky Howell & Annie out riding yesterday afternoon over to the three beaches & had a splendid time & got a good many shells, then in the evening we went out rowing on the bay with Eddie Howell & uncle H (the former makes a pretty good [bean?]) in the moonlight & sought the waves of the steam boats coming in, it was splendid, Lilly tried to row a little, but did not succeed very well.  Tell Aunt Annie I am going to get the story of the Haunted House fresh from Hannah Williams & Lilly or I will write it to her if she wants to know it very badly.  We were very glad to hear that you have cooler weather at home it must have been very hot - (pardonme, mamma) but it is only a slip of the tongue, I have in vain looked for hot in thy letters it's only "excessively warm."  Tell Hazen, Anna says she is going to bring home some shells to him & she wants him to answer her letter to him as soon as possible.  Aunt Mary sends her love & says she thinks she feels a little stronger though she don't attempt to walk far.  Anna wants me to tell Franky that some of the shells she is going to bring him are called boats & if he will put them in water they will float.  Love to papa, Alfred, Nannie & all at home & believe me thy loving daughter

  Dear Sister-
  Chellie received thy letter at the dinner table to day, but feels rather disinclined to write in the few minutes we have to spare before going to ride.  We had a fine South West wind yesterday and again to day so that the surf at the bathing beach was first rate this morning.  Charles and Carry, Elly and our party with two ladies from this house made a [load?] for the omnibus and we all enjoyed the sight and sound of the beaches very much, but Henry, Jimmie, Elly, and Lilly, were the only ones to go in.  they had a splendid bath they said.  H. unfortunately is deaf in one ear since and does not feel quite well so I doubt their going in tomorrow unless C. escorts them - and he has the rheumatism - Charly thinks Newport air is all sufficient without bathing.-  H. says I have no time to write as the carriage will be here.  Chelly is quite well, and all the rest.  aff thy sister Mary
  Love to Frank and the children. P.S. Dear Frank - In writing my review which is on hand, I want to make sure of a word I think wrongly used in the book review, and have no dictionary here.  Will thee please look in your Imperial Dictionary, - or the Text of the Iconographic (Anatomical part) & send me word, if found, in your next letter, whether there are not two words, ilium and ileum,
  and the definition of the latter, if,

Newport Oct 9th  1864, 1st day morn

Dear Sister–
I   recieved thy note (for I cannot call it a letter because it   contained so much nonsense) yester-day morning; but I did   not say poo! because I had an idea it was from Rachel or at   least hoped it did not contain nonsense.  I was glad to   recieve such information as thy note contained, & thought it   was a great compliment to be called handsome by sombody,   although I do not think father was much complimented by   having his hair called an iron gray color; unfortunatly I   did not lose my heart with her, although I think I must have   seen her & was very sorry I could not go to meting but my   knee was not equal to it.  I could have found some time to   write to you or thee butI have been very lazy since I have been here.  I delivered   thy message to Father (about Dr Thomas) but fear he has   forgotten about it, so I will remind him of it & now I must   close for I am getting lazy & will tell thee what we are   doing when there is some thing to tell about of more   consequence.  I believe Mother intends writing a   P.S.
Affec thy brother

P.S.  when I   said you on the first page near the bottom I meat Rachel &   thyself.  TP Cope Jr.

I am sorry there should be any   mistake about Dr. Thomas  I thought I told you, you would   have to send him word when you were ready to begin  You had   better tell him of myabsence from home so that he may understand why he was not   called on before.  So much for that - the burden of my   [----] is “painting.”  It is the burden on my mind & must of   course show itself in words.  Uncle Tom sent me word that he   had expressed a sample of color which Craig has prepared for   our inspection.  I suppose we may get the package tomorrow –   but what troubles me is the delay – Craig said he would have   it all done so we could come back the 20th.  If he has got   to put on two coats after he hears from us I fear he will   not be ready for us.  We are getting tired of this plan &   anxious to know whether there will be any difficulty about   getting intoour house on the 22nd.  Seventh day week - We have to engage   Staterooms two weeks before to get good ones & I intend   tomorrow to engage them for 6th day the 21st & if you find   the house cannot be got ready by that time you will please   send us word at once so that we can disengage the rooms.    Perhaps if Craig can not get all done & dry he can have the   kitchen & back passages finished & if the last coat is on   the parlors &c we might come in before it is dry–  I feel   sorry to have filled up Toms sheet with nothing but such a   message – try to do better next time.  It has been blowing   strong from the N.W. all day & is cold as charity Alf &   Hazen went to meeting with me in the morning & your   [br]other in the afternoon but its dull work here either   at the larger or smaller body Yankee self conceit shows   nowhere more.

Laurel House July 19th

My  dear Mama,
Rachel has   spent herself so in writing to thee that it seemed hardly   worth while for me to try, so I thought I wld. wait till her   fever was over, & as this eve. she seemed little inclined to   desert the piazza, I concluded to undertake the task.  We   have had a most exercising day in all senses of the word,   but so wonderful is the effect of this mountain air that I   do not feel the least tired.  In the first place this   morning we set off in an open wagon for Haines’ fall a   pleasant ride of about 2 miles, but it was after we got   there the “tug of war” began –  We hada regular scramble, part of the way was so rough that Tom &   Walter concluded to remain behind & before we got through   there was no one left but Harry Ellie & Madge & I, we went   down to the very foot of the lower falls, & were well   repaid; it was a most beautiful spot, a succession of six   lovely little falls ending in cascades & rapids, it was   altogether quite charming, the prettiest place of the kind I   ever saw, & I don’t remember ever to have seen a photograph   of it –  We did not get home till after the dinner bell had   rung, so were obliged just to give a little smoothe to our   hair, & go in in our mountain dresses, but every thing is   very primitive here, & nobody pretends to dress for dinner.    As we were all preparedwe concluded instead of changing our dresses to go after   dinner down the stream about a mile to Bastion falls under   Tom’s piloting, & soon comes in the adventure – we just got   to the head of the fall, & were [nerving] ourselves for a   scramble to the foot, when some one remarked that it was   raining, & sure enough it was, we took shelter under some   trees and concluded it wld. soon be over, & we would wait,   but it got harder & harder, & at last found its way through   the branches, & came down on us in large drops, which were   decidedly wetting, we tried it for a little while, but   finding there was no sign of stopping & we were getting very   wet we concluded to push on home, –  At first it seemed to   have slaked alittle, but it soon began harder than ever, & we went   tearing along jumping over rocks & through bushes till we at   last arrived at the foot of the Kauterskill, & then there   were all those dreadful stairs to go up – however we pushed   on, & at last arrived panting at the house – we were pretty   objects to be sure all wet, & draggled, & hot – there were   several gentlemen sitting round on the piazza, & I thought   it a remarkable instance of politeness that they did not   ever smile, I’m sure I could not have resisted it.  Of   course we retired immediately to our appartments, & changed   every thing making ourselves most comportable & desidedly   more presentable.  Thee need not feel the least concern for   I don’t think we are any of us a bitthe worse, & the most remarkable part is we are not tired.    The only thing that suffered was our hats, but I guess they   will look pretty well when they dry, & we’ll have to retrim   them at Newport –  Thee must be sure & not forget my bonnet   so that if we should arrive 7th day night I may have   something to wear to meeting.  Also mother I think I forgot   to put on the list a thin white body of mine & my best   underbody that I wanted to have done up & brought in the   trunk – Virginia will know.  Tom wrote to Father yesterday   to go by 7th days steamer, & one of us will try to write by   the next.  We are having a most delightful time, & as thee   willsee by my account I am as well as possible, so thee need not   have any anxiety on my account.  I do hope you are getting   along nicely, & don’t feel very lonely, I know thee must   miss Father very much, but I hope he will be a great deal   better for his voyage & come home to us quite strong, & free   from all those miserable head-aches.  
Aunt L & Chell   send love, & the former says she is intending to write to   thee very soon.  
Give a great deal of love to all, &   Virginia especially I want to write to her, she was so very   kind in helping me to get ready to come away, I don’t know   what I should have done without her.  
Good-night dear   Mama,
thy ever loving
Lily

      My dear Frank,      

      I rec'd thine & Chellie’s letters to day, when Tho's came out from town.  They also had one from Mary, and we are glad to hear of your safe arrival at Snow Shoe and very thankful I am, that you had a doctor so near at hand to extract the bone from thy throat.  I read thy letter first, and was much alarmed. before knowing what the accident thee alluded to was, but Thomas fortunately knew about it from Mary's letter & told me at once.  What a providential thing it was, that there was a Dr. so near at hand.  the children must have been very much frightened, before thee was relieved.--I hope thee will be careful of thyself, and not jump, and injure thy arch again.—
      -
      attached wife Anna S. Cope.  I hope Tom is provided with warm under-clothing.  Mary sends her love & hopes you will have a good time.I hope thee has enough warm clothing, with thee, for I sh'd not be surprised of thr warmest weather is past.  We are having it delightful here at home, the thermometer 68 this morning at 8 o'clock and under 80 at noon.  This afternoon Thomas & Elizabeth Mary & I called at father's, and afterwards at Ellis Yarnall's leaving Mary at father's.  We found them all at home, and had a very pleasant visit.  Lucy Harrison is very bright & agreeable & Anne is lovely.  She told me she had written a note to Lillie, which I would send to her when it comes to hand.  She also told me she was sorry not to go to Snow Shoe with you, but they could not go to Chicago, & as their time is so limited they of course felt anxious to see as much as possible before going home.  they expect to go to Detroit from Chicagoand then on to Niagara.  They expect to leave sometime next week, and take the journey alone.  We all disapprove of them taking such a long journey by themselves, but I suppose Ellis Yarnall will find out some one to look after them.  When they go on, they expect to spend the first night at Altoona, and then travel day & night until they reach Chicago.  I have sent Lillie & Chellie some under-clothing.  2 flannel skirts, 2 under vests, 1 cloth body, 2 pairs thick stockings, 1 pair drawers, 1 [Alpaca?] skirt.  Anna & Carrie are quite well, & the former is invitee to spend tomorrow with cousin Mary [W.?] Brown's little Mary.  I did not [?] like [?]-ing her just now, but could not well decline.  I was at father's this afternoon, and they were all pretty well.  father seems stronger from the change in weather.  I saw bro. John and his boys go off this morning, and hope they had apleasant trip to Altoona.  I am glad you met with such a polite reception at Bellefonte.  I had no idea before, that there was any such spring of water, there as mentions.  63000 gallons a minute is immense.  I think you must have enjoyed the ride up the mountain very much, if the views are so beautiful.  Give my love to Lillie & Chellie, and tell them I hope they will not be put out at my sending them some warm clothing, as I am only sorry they did not send for warm dresses too, as they have nothing warm with them.  It is now bed-time and I must put by my writing; the children are enjoying Anna Hartshorne's company very much.  I hope some of you will write tho' I do not want you to tax yourselves.  I have already been much favored.  Bro Thomas intended sending sister Anne's letter, but it was not returned from Aunt Ruth's in time.  with much love to you all, ever thy

   Knowing you will be glad to know of our whereabouts and our welfare I suggested this afternoon to Chellie that I should write to thee dear mother-  We are now seated on the balcony overlooking the Hudson and enjoying ultimately the lovely view and thoughts of the dear ones left at Germantown-
   
   But to go back to where our sixth day letters left off-  It was then our intention to have gone to Overlook yesterday.  But Chellie woke up with a headache and as the boat left pretty early in the morning we gave it up-  After breakfast Chellie feeling much better we concluded to come as far as this place and spend firtst-day here and go onto Overlook tomorrow.  Which plan we have thus far carried out-  Our ride up the Hudson was perfectly beautiful-  The afternoon being cool with just enough soft flucy clouds floating about to make the hills beautiful in light and shadow.  I have never been to Cozzens before and it certainly is a most delightful place-  The view is much more extended than from Roe's, (and seen when the Highlands are covered with the soft purple light of evening and the western sky filled with a gorgeously colored clouds or when softened by the moonlight pouring over the top of the opposite hills and silvering the waters of the Hudson), it is remarkably beautiful-  I hope you are having a share of the delightfully cool air we are enjoying today and I wish some of you at home and thee especially could be invigorated after all the fatigue both bodily and mentally thee has undergone within the past few weeks with its mountain pureness-
   
   Our plans for tomorrow are to leave here on the steamboat and go to  Rondout and go up the mountain the afternoon reaching the Hotel sometime in the evening-  As to what we have been doing I guess I had better follow Chellies advice and say nothing about it, as under the circumstances we should probably be laughed at whatever we did-  However I will tell thee, for I know it will meet thy approbation that we have kept pretty quiet that Chellie (and myself as to that) might rest-
   
   Chellie is going to add a postscript to this so must leave her some room so with a quiet deal of love to father Lily and all the rest at home I will
   conclude.  With much love I am thy

   J. Evans It seems hardly worth while, dear mother, to add to Jonathan's epistle for he has told about all there is to tell, but one thing he has not told thee, and that is what good care he has taken of this daughter of thine, how he writes on her as she has never been waited on before, until she tells him that she is afraid he will spoil her by making too much of her; though I hope there is no danger of that, and I don't truly think it will.
   
   We have so enjoyed our visit here, that I think it is just as well probably that we were detained, and spent our First-day here instead of at Overlook, and if we only have such lovely weather at the latter place as we have had here we can desire nothing better. With much love to father Lilly, Hazen, my dear little sisters and all, I remain thy loving daughter

   My dear Mother
   
   Altho I have written to father and Tom has also written a long letter so that I am afraid they will be as uninteresting as "twice-told tales" yet I am going to send thee a few lines in a scrappy way for they own edification. We do so enjoy having Tom with us and he seems to be not only enjoying himself but improving--when he first joined us at London he looked very badly not having recovered from the sea voyage I suppose he was very pale and thin, but has been gaining pretty steadily so that now his cheeks have quite a color and he looks fuller in the face than I ever remember to have see him--I do not think his leg troubles him much, as he says it does not hurt him, and he walks about a good deal--we shall try to keep him from doing too much--
   
   I think Chellie seems stronger than when we left home, as she is certainly able to walk more and does not get as fatigued as she would at home--
   
   She has gained some flesh but is not what you would call stout yet. For a day or two her throat has been a little swelled, but I shall get her some [tannin?] or a gargle and I think that will relieve her. I have written [---] particularly in regard to health as I know thee would like to know. The weather except a few days in London has been cool so that we have generally not been able to wear our [thin?] clothes. Chellie has not found her waterproof dress to wear for traveling and now that we are going north shawls are called into acquisition. Evening 9.05. I wish thee could look in upon us this evening and see how snugly we are fixed, seated around a centre table in our cosey little parlor with four candles burning upon on the table and at this point Tom came in and proposed we should take a row upon the lake in the moonlight and as it was a lovely evening we went and now have just returned--I did wish for some of the girls form Awbury for it was so perfectly beautiful that even the [staid manied?] people almost grew sentimental--The lake was just rippled by the gentle wind and the moon was hanging over the western mountains throwing a silvered path across the water, and on the shores we could dimly see the outlines of Wray Castle and the pretty residences with which the shores are studded, and in which the lights were brightly shining. The rain which continued most of the day stopped toward evening and although the roads were rather muddy we started out for exercise and had a pleasant walk of three miles toward Bowness. [---] tt has cleared we expect to start early tomorrowmorning for Keswick. As this letter is for thy information on little points in travels I will tell thee of our general hours. We find it suits us best not to dine later than three or half past and so whether we take our dinner at the hold or elsewhere try to have it at that hour. We breakfast generally at half past eight and then take tea at half past seven or eight and spend our evening in our sitting room either writing home or in journals or in talking over the scenes of the day and planning for the morrow. In traveling we generally manage to have a car to ourselves and Reuben looks after the baggage and Tom eitherkeeps him or assists Chellie and H, while I am buying our tickets-  We get along very nicely indeed-  In the last letters thee said that some of them at home thought "thee was writing too much", I hope thee will not stay thy hand on that account, but only as thy strength will warrant, for I can assure thee every detail of home news is very interesting-  We think of you very very often and I hope the time may come when thee will enjoy the beauties which we are visiting, but altho the present is so full of enjoyment the future (when we shall return to your midst) looks very pleasant.
   
   The little books dear mother, which thee gave us just before leaving are our constant compantions in our travels and it is pleasant to think as we read them morning and evening that thee too has them and altho the time may be different yet we read them the same day-  I enclose a little bunch of wild flowers which I picked while visiting Swarthmore part of them I gathered at the meeting house and part from the Hall, I wish they were better preserved but they were pressed under difficulties in my pocketbook and I had to arrange them for pressing as we walked.  I send them thinking thee might like a little memento of Swarthmore-  I am afraid this will prove a scrappy letter and rather uninteresting for it is madeup of little nothings-  Hannah desires her love to thee and the rest of the Awbury family-  When thee sees them at School Lane please give them my love also a great deal to all at home and at Uncle Toms and Uncle John's, Chellie has retired or would join me in these messages-  With much love I am thy loving son
   J.Evans.
   P.S.  I dont know if any mention has been made of how Reuben is and as his father and mother were rather anxious about him when we left, will thee tell them that I think he is much better, but would improve faster if he took more rest especially in writing his letters and journal as he often sets up late and is up early-

   My dear Mother
   
   I hope this evening that no one has written home for a day or two and know thee will like to hear often so I will send a few lines this evening before the mail closes.  We have had a very warm day the thermometer standing at 83 [degrees] a good deal of the time and there has been very little air stirring-  This morning Mary, Alexis Alf, John Hazen and Henry made an excursion to the top of Kate's Mountain.  They had an early breakfast and got off about 8 oclock and did not get back until nearly one.  They had a pretty rough scramble and some how did not get to the right place and so missed the view-  I was glad they went as they thought it paid and I am afraid they find it rather monotonous-  The life is a very lazy one and while it is so warm in the middle of the day there is very little to be done in the way of excercize, with any comfort-  I think Alf seems better and the water suits him but Hazen is not able to drink the sulphur water and does not seemed to have impreoved as much as I hoped he would-  I do not mean that he is sick but he still looks pale.  He seems bright and much less nervous than when he left home and I hope he will improve more after his return-  Lily has bathed twice (yesterday and today) having her bath at about 100 [degrees] and says she thinks it suited her for after lying down she felt refreshed and better-  but of course it is too soon for there to be much change-  She stayed in the first day only about 2 minutes and today 5 so thee sees she is feeling her way.
   
   This afternoon Lily and Alexis took a drive-  I have been disappointed 3
   in the air here it is not bracing at all-  and as the mountains are all around us often we get but little breeze-
   
   The daily routine of our life here is not thrilling-  We rise about half past seven and it is often half past eight before we get assembled at the breakfast table-  After breakfast (which we rarely get through until quarter past nine) we walk around the grounds for a little while visiting the spring, Japanese Store, Post Office &c and then spend the time until 11 o'ck (when we bathe) either in reading, writing or talking-.  After the bath we put in the time as best we may until dinner time 2 O'clk.  After dinner we set out under the trees upon the lawn or upon our piazza and read aloud or talk until tea time and after tea we generally take a walk and then sit in the parlor until bedtime "and thus our days go on, go on"  The boys vary it occasionally by a little walk upon their own account or by going swimming or sometimes we roll a game of ten pins-  I have gone very much into details and I have no doubt father and Tom will laugh at the letter and groan over such a life (so do I) but I thought these little nothings would interest thee and moreover there is very little else to tell-  Our movements in the future are very uncertain and as yet we cannot say when we shall home or whether some will remain- as soon as some conclusion is arrived at we will let you know.  Please give a great deal of love to father Tom Anna & Carrie in which Chellie would join me if she knew I was writing but I am in the gentlemans writing room and she does not know of it-  With much love for thyself I am thy loving son J. Evans

My dear Lillie
Yesterday when I was called to dinner I was agreeably surprised to find thine [-] Alexis's nice letters [-] two postal cards from Alf which were quite cheering, as we have not seen a sign of his handwriting since the 30th of November.  The dates of your letter were from the 6th to the 8th og Feb - and we were very glad to hear of your pleasant excursion to ["Turbia"], and the ["Bercean"], and that you had [----] with such agreeable company [-----] Arthur Albright? from Birmingham!  Thee does not mention Lilly Bright & her sisters, so we suppose, they never have left [M------], tho thee has not said so.  I expect thy father has already apprised you of the sad news of Aunt Rebecca Cope's death.  when I wrote to you last I had no idea that she was dangerously sick but the sudden attack of Pneumonia & paralysis was very unexpected to all of them, and they were not alarmed about her until 5th day noon tho she hadthen been suffering from Pneumonia and the Dr. had told her that one lung was seriously enveloped and she told him that she felt resigned either to live or die.  On 5th day night she was attacked by paralysis on the right side and when the Dr. saw her that morning (6th day) he thought there was no hope of her recovery and she died at 5 o'clock that afternoon.  She was perfectly conscious to the very end, and tho' her speech was difficult they were able to understand what she said by close attention and she called James by name a few minutes before her death.  James & Louise, Cousin Lillie Garrett & her niece Fanny Garrett, who was much attached to her  were all in the room with her, and she was perfectly calm, not appearing to suffer except from short breathing, tho' they could not tell certainly as thee was so much serenity. 
Mother had not time to finish this letter but I thought as possibly Alfs letter might be forwarded to some other place than yours I had better let this go so that you might be [----] to hear of Aunt R's death.  It is a lovely bright day for the funeral - very different from the day uncleA. was buried.  You will see a great many changes when you return home.  So different from what it was when I was abroad.  Then all our immediate family & friends I found when I came back very much as I left them - but it has been very much otherwise now.  If we were all so well prepared as Uncle A & Aunt R. how little real difference it would make.  Only a little longer separation - But as it is it is a fearful consideration to some of us.  I have no time to write more.

   Dear Cousin Anna,
   
   I recd thy note announcing the death of thy dear sister, and it was very thoughtful and loving of them to remember me-  though I had, the day before, recd a short note from Henry himself. It was sudden as sad to me, as I had heard nothing of her further declining health or illness. When I saw cousin Mary last was at Mt. Pleasant about 2 years ago. Then, though looking delicate, she seemed as bright and reminded me strongly of the days of her beautiful girlgood. O, those dreamlike days! of your cousins, in your Arch st. home, and the several Paradises, that the 'Doctor', and cousin Frank and I need to riflealong the Schuykill and Wissahiccon every spring- for the first and fairest flowers and how you loved to prink your happy parlors with them. I replied quite at length. For me to Henry’s letter, and told him I hoped to come on to P. to see my brothers soon, and hoped to see him which I still wish to do. It would have been a great comfort to me, if I could have come on to the funeral, but my state of health at that time prevented by a sudden change in the weather I had taken. A touch of Pleurisy which I had to break up I and we all, Mariann and Anna (who meet Cousin Mary at mt. Pleasant), were with you that sad afternoon in mournful communion. Is n't itremarkable, that you all, of your sisterhood of five, shd. have been spared to Each other so long. And as these days Mary was always so joyous a nature you must all miss her sunshine. How could our hearts bear up under all the partings on our dearest me, on Earth did we not see the vision of the Angel world and among them, our "family in Heaven". Where hope assues me we shall meet beyond all partings I fear illegible note, will find there and thin in health and with love to all and to cousins Susan & Lizzie & Fanny. I will close adding only that [Marien?] & Anna wish their love to you. Excuse my not replying to thy letters, Dear Cousin Anna, which I wasvery grateful for. For if the Dr. had not written, I should have heard, very sorrowfully so I have in several cases of Philada relations, when the first news I heard was long after: Knowing of it and I could mingle with you in Spirit, and live over our happy long days and anticipate those happier ones to come. That Death cannot end, nor sorrow overcast.
   Love especially to cousin Frank.
   
   From thy Afft,
   Cousin Edward
   
   P.S. After I wrote this last note Cousin Anna, recd Alfred cards & those for Sister Anna & Henry wh. We have forwarded to Boston. It mush be a very happy affair. All sounds and we should be glad to be present but Anna will have too send cards instead. Aff, EdwardNot Being sure of your home P.S. address I mail this for Brr David to forward.

Dear Grandma

I was very much obliged for the book thee sent me on my birthday, about General Wolf in Canada.  I have read some if it and I think it is veryinteresting.  Please tell Algie I was very much obliged for the paper he sent me, tell him that I will write to him soon.  I got a very nice fishing-pole from Mama & uncle Tom, & a reel & some lines from Grandpa.  I also got a history of England from Mama which I think interesting.  Agnes & Mrs. Oliver each gave me a book, and Ellie gave me a knife.  Cousin Anna & Virginia gave me a box of blocks & a set of old maids.

Dear Mother,

Thy lettters seem to have come to the right place at the right time, as I have received them all I think.  I am very much discusted at the delay about ordering the wagon.  I can not see but what the two-wheeler is not as safe as a four-wheeler.  At any rate the two-wheeled cart is much the lightest and easier to turn if you should happen to get into a tight place; but the main advantage is that they are lighter, & as we have nostrong horse suitable for the girls to drive, I should think that we had better get the two-wheeler.  If you have desided pretty much not to get the cart, I think you might as well get a light buggie something like thine.  Thee will have to deside now or never if we are going to get it this summer.
The hotel where we are staying now is a very fashionable place, & there is not much fishing or anything else to do.  Yesterday we took a lovely steamboat ride along the Canadian shore & among the islands.  It was verypretty indeed as all the islands on the Canada side belong to the government & are very wild for nobody is aloud to build on them.  Now we have seen the islands there is not much to do, so we intend to leave here tomorrow morning & take the boat to Kingston and from there to Cimcoe Island where the fishing is said to be very fine.
I got a very nice letter last Friday evening from Grandma saying that  Grandpa was going on toNewport, as uncle Thomas was coming home from Berkshire.  Uncle Tom thinks of taking the boat from Cimcoe Island to Toronto and then coming home by Niagara.  But he has not desided certainly about it yet, partly owing to the strike at Buffalo.  If he does that I shall return with him as I may not get another chance for some time.  If uncle Edgar likes the fishing at Cimcoe he will probably stay a few days later.  So thee sees there is nothing certainly desided about coming home.  Uncle E thinks he may stop atTunkhannock on his way to Overbrook and try the fishing in the Susequehanna.  I will return any how by the 1st Sept., and will try and let thee know the day before, when we are coming.
Tell Ellie I will try & right to her soon.
Affec'ly thy son
Francis R. Cope Jr.
Uncle Tom thinks we had better get the cart and try it, and that there need be no danger if we drive carefully.
Uncle Tom sends is love to thee.

   My dear friends
    Francis & Anna Cope,
   
   Those only who have passed thr'o a similar trial, can justly measure the affliction which is now your portion. So I find my heart going out in tender sympathy with yours and our earnest desire that he among whose gracious offices it still is to "heal the broken hearted", and "to comfort them that mourn", may be near to sustain & comfort you.
   
   To a loving parent, the right time never comes, as viewed from our standpoint, to part with a dear child. The infancy, its very tenderness & helplessness beget the care it is there so continually needing. As childhood comes with all its winsome ways, it is surely hard to give the little one up. And when mandhood or womanhood have been reached, and ourhopes brighten for their future, or we fondly look for ripenning fruit from all our care & anxiety & effort for their temporal & spiritual good, a feeling akin to bitter disappointment is mingled with the sorrow, as we bear them to the silent tomb.
   
    But the Christian believer has learned, not only thr'o observing the lots of others, but by his own happy experience, that a Heavenly Father, who "tender mercies are over all His works", and whose "compassions fail rest", knows best how to deal with us and our loved ones, and that "he doeth all things well".  Whether we understand the meaning of the dispenesation or not, we can thr'o our tears exclaim, "The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away, but blessed be the name of the Lord." This filial submission to the Will of God, we well know comes to us only thr'o the humbling, sweetening, calming influences of his grace. But I rejoice to believe you have known & felt its efficacious power, and I long that it may in this time of need, rest largely upon the spirits of you both.Some sweet lines by Charlotte Elliot, you may be already familiar with, but they seem so fitted for those who are passing this heavy trials, that I will add a few stanzas, th'o feeling sure you will appreciate them all.
   
    If those shouldst call me to resign
   What most I prize, it ne'er was mine:
   I only yield thee what was there;
   "Thy will be done".
   
   If but my fainting heart be blest
   With thy sweet spirit for its guest,
   My God! To thee I leave the rest,
   "Thy will be done"
   
   Renew my will from day to day;
   Blend it with thine, and take away
   All that now makes it hard to say,
   "Thy will be done."
   
   Then, when on earth I breathe no more
   The prayer half mixed with tears before,
   We sing, upon a happier shore,
   "Thy will be done"
   
   My lameness still keeps me a cripple,and almost house-bound, or I should gladly have been with you ere this, but the above may express, better perhaps than I could in person, the loving sympathy and desires of
   
   your attached friend,
   Saml Morris.

Dearest Grandma,
I thought thee might like to see these little pictures, although this place is too beautiful for pictures to do it justice.  You lose the height, & also the color, which is very lovely- partly because of the red soil & partly, I expect, on account of the wonderful lights & shadows.  Yesterday afternoon a shower swept across the water toward us with a rainbow in its midst & theeffect against a dark background of clouds was beautiful.  I know how thee would love & enjoy it all, & I long to send it across to thee.  The streams are very rocky & swift & the fresh delicate [---] of the [---] along their banks makes a beautiful picture.  The primroses are exquisite- so delicate, but I have not seen any violets like ours at Awbury!

Miss R. wants me to give thee her love.  She has thy little pincushion hanging by our mirror & we feel quite decorated!  Please give my dear love to Grandpa & to Uncle Tom & Uncle Hazen & Aunt Margaret.  Also to Aunt Anna & Aunt Carrie if thee should think of it.  With a great deal for thyself, I am thy very loving Anna.Lynton Cottage Hotel,A Devonshire Lane, Nr Lynton.Allerford bridge.Salisbury, The Close, Pretty Corner.

   July 11th, 1907
   
   My Dearest Grandparents, 
   
     I have been meaning to write to you for some time, but somehow have not got it done so far, with the exception of one poor postal. 
    
   Well, we have been having the best kind of a time. The voyage was most enjoyable for there were some very jolly people on board and there was lots of deck-room for games. 
   
    Since landing we have had a good deal of rainy weather but we don't seem to mind rain at all, and it has not interfered with our plans except once or twice when we have taken the coach instead of walking in the rain. The cold too, for it has been pretty chilly at times, has been rather a blessing than otherwise for it has made our walks and sightseeing tours all the more enjoyable, and the soft coal fires have been very nice and cheerful. 
    
   Our trip through Devonshire was a great success, though we can scarcely call it a walking trip as we walked only two days instead of four. From London we went straight to Tintagel, arriving there Seventh day evening. The cliffs are perfectly magnificent and we spent most of First day morning admiring them from King Arthur's Castle which is on a beautiful promontory. Finding it was impossible to get our bags to Bude on the Sabbath we took the only course open and drove there,  taking them with us. It was disappointing to miss the walk, but we had the more time at Tintagel of which we were very glad. Bude was rather uninteresting, but the walk from there to Clovelly is certainly charmingly quaint, though the tourists have, I suppose, come in such swarms that it seems as though the place were artificially natural (if you can guess what I mean by that). From Clovelly we went to Ilfracombe by boat and thence we coached to Lynton. Here again we had expected to walk but were again prevented, this time by rain. Lynton and Lynmouth took my fancy very much, and Paul Brown and I had a delightful walk up the Valley of the Lyn to Watermeet (where the East and West Lyn come together)The next day we walked to Porlock in spite of the rain.  We were very fortunate, however, and each time a shower overtook us we were able to reach shelter.  The dark, low-flying clouds with here and there a burst of sunshine rather added to the wildness of Exmoor and it was not hard to imagine that the Doones might almost still be living in some of the wild valleys.  We saw a herd of the wild Exmoor ponies but were not fortunate enough to see any of the red-deer which we were told at Porlock are not at all uncommon.  From Porlock we went to Tintern by train.  It was a rather tedious journey with a good deal of waiting.  The two place are only about thirty miles apart in a straight line, but it took us six hours toreach our destination.
   
   Tintern Abbey is a fine old ruin and takes you back to the Middle Ages, giving the whole town an air of antiquity.  The little chapel on the hill, which they say is older than the abbey was also very interesting and we spent last Seventh-day morning (till train time) wandering around them and taking pictures of them.
   
   We came straight to Chester from Tintern, and I must say I was rather disappointed in it.  The Cathedral is fine but the Walls do not amount to very much it seems to one.  We left here First-day evening and went to Carnarvon where we were very much interested in the Castle which dates I believe from 1256.  At Carnarvon the rain again interfered with our walking, and this time it rained so hard that the coach did not run and we were obliged to go to Bedd-gelert by train.  In some ways Bedd-gelert appeals to me more than most of the places we have seen.  It is such a quiet little town, "far from the madd'ning crowd's ignoble strife," nestled in the heart of the Welsh Mts, that I felt I should like to have more time there.  In the afternoon it stopped raining and we walked down the Pass of Aberglaslyn where they say the cliffs rise eight hundred feet from the road.  It is especially fine now as the recent rains have filled the streams very full and the little brooks tumbling over themselves down the mountainsides are very beautiful.
   
   When we awoke the next morning we were again greeted by the pleasant patter of rain, but we decided to walk to Beltus-y-coed at any rate.  I am very glad we did as it soon stopped raining and it was a very pretty walk.  At Capel-Curig we again saw the king (we had seen him twice in London) this time in plain every-day clothes in an automobile, on his way to Carnarvon.  The people had gathered from far and near and greeted him enthusiastically.  I was interested to her them sing the Welsh national anthem in their native language, which is certainly most unintelligible.  This morning we returned here and this afternoon visited the Cathedral after which Arthur and I went to see Eaton Hall, the Duke of Westminster's place.  As he is now in London we were allowed to go over his house, of course for a shilling, (everything is for a shilling) and were very much interestedto see how he lives.  It is a most magnificent place, "rich but not gaudy" and somehow seems much more "fit" than some of the summer cottages at Newport, though I imagine, as far as money goes that Newport's "cozy little cottages" are quite as grand.  Eaton Park is a beautiful stretch of land about three miles (or more) long and the deer grazing in the open fields were very pretty.
   
   I have now come to the end of my letter, and as it is growing late I must close.  Please give a great deal of love to Uncle Tom and to Aunt C. and Uncle W and their family and keep a great great deal for yourselves
   from your loving grandson
   Harold.

   Dear Cousin Anna
   
   Martha and I wish to tell thee how much we appreciate being asked to go to Awbury today-    I can remember so well the day of your & Cousin Frank's Wedding, and the evening soon after which you spent with my father and Mother. I was only seven years old but itmade a great impression upon me- and cousin Frank's kind greeting to me then was never forgotten. as I grew older and learned to know more about him my childish regard grew into respect and reverence and from that time until now, it has been a happiness to know that I could claim as a cousin one whose character I so thoroughly admired and respected- it is indeed men such as he was, who makeour country great and at the same time have all the gentle qualities which inspire admiration and affection-  We cannot regret that he has gone, for he had billed the full measure of his days, we can only remember that "Precious in the light of the Lord is the death of his Saints"
   
   With love from Martha and Me, I am dear Cousin Anna.
    Most affectionately, Mary J.B. Chew

   Dearest Aunt Anna,
   
    There is nothing to say to thee but that I think of thee all the time, and long to be near thee instead of on the other side of the earth. The letters with any definite news will be very slow in coming, as these of mine must seem late and longin reaching you. But thee knows, and you all know, how my heart is with you. I have been thinking of Father’s last message to his "more than brother", and of what both he and thee have been to me all my life. From my babyhood thee has made me feel almost as much thy child as mother’s and to me it seems those tiesare not broken but made strong for eternity, where our beloved cross to the Beyond. My desire is to be worthy of such an inheritance of affliction as mine. My love can never repay it, but that thee has always.
   
   Ask some to write me a line when they can. My Love to them all.
   
   Thy always loving niece,
   Anna C. Hartshorne

Awbury, 
   September 16th
   
   Dearest Grandma, 
   
   It was dear of thee to write to me & I certainly appreciate thy doing so & thank thee very much.  Mother, Aunt Lilly Alg & I have already enjoyed thy letter & I will give it to Harold when I get a chance.  He is over near the polls this afternoon trying to get people to register, as this is the last day.  This evening he is going3
   down to Mrs. [Brabury's].  Thee knows he is to be an usher for Paul Brown next fourth day. 
   
   I am sorry not to have written before this to thank thee for the lovely visit I had at4
   Northeast.  I did so enjoy it, & you have done so much for us all,- this summer.  Thank thee very much, dear Grandma, & I want to thank Uncle Tom, too.  I am so sorry to have given so5
   much trouble with my ticket & hot-water bag! 
   
   Well!  the wedding came off yesterday, & in spite of the rain it was lovely.  Jac made such a lovely little bride, & Edward was beaming.6
   They had the ceremony in the large parlor right in front of the Mantel-piece this way-
   [illustration] 
   The mantel piece was decorated with maiden-hair & white7
   [---] & there were jars of white daisy-like flowers on each side.  Little Theodore & Brewster in white sailor suits & with little baskets of tiny white chrysanthemums stood on one side.  They did not8
   walk in.  Joe & Alg walked in just as we started the first hymn-  Dick is bringing thee a leaflet with the hymns on it-  Then Theodora & Eleanor came walking in with little Mary be-9
   tween them- all with baskets like the little boys- then came Jac & her father.  They all stood in front of the fire place.  The ceremony was lovely- Joe was fine & Ed & Jac were "dear"10
   & it was all so solemn & full of feeling.  After the benediction they all sat down-  I tried to mark where on the plan- & there was a few minutes of silent worship.  Then the last hymn & they11
   walked out.  They came back soon, however, & stood in front of the mantel to speak to people.  We all sat down to the breakfast.  There were 24 at the brides table- I will put in a plan to show12
   how we sat.  There was an enormous bride's cake in the center & this with white [---] & white china [---] as decoration made the table pretty.  The cake had a ring, thimble & piece of money in it & Jac cut13
   it.  They had no wedding cake.  They got off very nicely in Henry Scattergoods auto, after running down stairs & through the crowd & getting sprinkled with rice! 14
   I expect Dick will be with thee by the time this arrives & will tell thee about the wedding.  Please give her my best love & tell her I will write to her soon.  Please give my love to Aunt Anna & Uncle Theo. & Uncle Tom & keep much, dear Grandma, for thyself,
   from
   Thy loving
   Anna
