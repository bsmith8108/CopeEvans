Not that   I\u2019m so very busyCOMMA but since I lie down every noon when I get   home from bathing in timeCOMMA and in the evenings we have Mary   Williams\u2019 lamp incased in the same little plain bonnet so   that we have no chance either to write or read after darkCOMMA   unless we take a lamp and go up stairs.  <br>On 6th day we   ordered the boatCOMMA but were not able to go outCOMMA on account of   the rain.  In the morning Alfred had the pleasure of   witnessing a little sail boat upsetCOMMA the man who was in it   managed to get on the bottom untill a sail boat came to his   assistance.  In the afternoon the rain slackened some and we   made up quite a large party and hired the omnibus to go to   the south Shore and see if the horn spoutedCOMMA we had George   and thecarriage beside.  When we got there the horn did not spout   at allCOMMA but the waves were very fineCOMMA and towards the latter   part of the timeCOMMA when the sun came outCOMMA very beautiful the   sun shone on the spray making nearly half of a rainbow.  We   staid till quite late stopping on the way home at the   boathouseCOMMA the sea there was not nearly so fine though.  On   seventh day morning we made up a small fishing expeditionCOMMA   consisting of AlfCOMMA HazenCOMMA Tom LongstrethCOMMA George and myself.   We went about a mile above the poor house anchoring in a   little cove near the rail-road.  We had quite good luckCOMMA and   caught about 24 fishCOMMA including 2 star fishCOMMA several   ChaucksusCOMMA and one very fat eelCOMMA which I had the   gratification of catching.  Since we have been here we have   seen two very curious fishCOMMA one called an \u201cold maidCOMMA\u201d which   is about 1 foot long and white underneath; the other is a   \u201cswell fishCOMMA\u201d and looks very much like other fishCOMMA except   when you turn it over and rub it gentlyit becomes inflated and is puffed out like a small   air-baloonCOMMA it is about 6 inches long.  The fishermen on the   point have had a reading room and small library established   for their benefit in a back room looking out on the bay at   \u201cGodderdsCOMMA\u201d (I don[t] know whether I have spelt it right or   notCOMMA but if thee pronounces it the way its spelt thee will   know where I mean) by a Miss or Mrs. Gibbs.  They take the   daily and some of the illustrated papersCOMMA and I noticed a   number of the \u201cBritish Gardiner\u201d I think it was on the   table.  Well to come to the point at once; uncle Harry was   invited to deliver a sort of a lecture to them on last 6th   day evening.  George Merrit seemed very desirous that the   ladies would come up and hear the discourseCOMMA which some of   them did.  The speech was very grand the subject being   \u201cWaterCOMMA\u201d I dont know whether the fishermen properly   appreciated itCOMMA since I heard one remark afterwards thatCOMMA   \u201cit wouldtake a purty smart man to follow him.\u201d  I believe uncle   Harry proposes to deliver some more during this week on   Light and Air.  20th 3rd day.  Yesterday we took a sail over   to the Dumplings and landed those that wanted toCOMMA the rest   of us going on downCOMMA towards Bever Tail.  This morning we   proposed sailing around CanonicutCOMMA recruits came in slowly   since they had been all finished by the expedition to the   Light shipCOMMA however as it turned out there was not enough   wind and we had to defer it untill tomorrowCOMMA and go bathing   instead.  This afternoon mother contemplates going sailing   if George thinks we are not going to have a squall; at   present it looks very much like rain.  I suppose Mother has   told thee all about the storm they have been having at home.   I hope we\u2019ll not have it here.

It seemed so near to usCOMMA & the more so      because the very day after wh. it occurred we had planned to      make a little excursion to Washington for the day having      been invited by one of Miss M\u2019s frds. who often goes down.       So you can judge of our horror when a few min. before      setting outCOMMA this dreadful intelligence was brot. to us. The      feeling here against the seccessionists has been intense as      they have been heard to rejoice in the sts. at thedreadful newsCOMMA & to have prophesied a few days since that   our rejoicings wld. be turned to sorrow.  The city was under   martial law for a day or two \u2013 but by the strict vigilance   of the authorities was kept quiet.  but they compelled every   secessionist as well as union on the principal business sts   to drape their stores in mourning & [if] the appearance it   presents is very solemn & sad.  I suppose it is the same in   Phila. \u2013 & everywhere.  It seems really a more horrible   thing than some we have shrunk frm. reading in books of   history.  People here seem to be sanguine about the new   administration \u2013 & the prospects of peaceCOMMA but that does not   take away frm. the horrible fact that there can exist in our   midst such a wicked & fiendish spirit.<br>4th day morn \u2014 our   school has been dismissed to day on account of the   solemnities wh. are to be observed in the churches &   elsewhere<br>We also had a holliday on 2nd day & Jesse Tyson   very kindly took advantage of it to take us a very beautiful   ride to a lake abt. 7 miles frm. here wh. is situated among   hills & woods as beautiful as any Iever saw.  I had no idea there was anything of the kind so   near to the city.  It was delightful to get a sight of the   beautiful spring in the country.  The trees are just putting   out their first leavesCOMMA & look so lovelyCOMMA & we cld. not but   enjoy it in spite of the mournful circumstances wh. have   been so much in our mindsCOMMA  Jesse took us past his placeCOMMA   where he wishes to erect his model house.  It is a very   beautiful situation indeed with views of the city & the bay   &c.<br>I suppose you (that is some of you) are in the midst   of yearly meeting now. but the sad newsmust have thrown a great damp over every thing.<br>We have   been spending two or three afternoons this week at the   meeting house sewing for the refugees.  The friends have a   sewing machine thereCOMMA & meet every day this week to sew.  &   they will get a good deal accomplished no doubt.

Fine breeze- Band tuning up for a   song before we reach the pier.  Arrived at the pier at   5.P.M.  On first day evening we took a walk to Tammany Hill.   we started after a 6 o\u2019clock tea but were not able to get   there untill dark or dusk.  It is the first time I was ever   there.  We saw the lights at Point JudithCOMMA the Light ShipCOMMA   Bever Tail and the Break water.  Yesterday was splendidlyclear.  In the morning we took a short floatCOMMA I cant call it   a sail there wasn\u2019t any windCOMMA after which we went bathing.    In the afternoon I made up a small sailing party consisting   of Alice CarterCOMMA Abby NewhallCOMMA Tom Longstreth and AlfredCOMMA we   went out to the Dumplings and landedCOMMA & afterwards came back   to take Caroline Mary her first sail.  She could\u2019nt have had   a more pleasant evening it neither too cold nor too warmCOMMA &   there was a splendid breeze.  We went around Rose Island and   got back in good season.  though not strictly obeying her   mothers instructions about being home at half past 6.  This   morning we went bathing as usual and also engaged the boatCOMMA   Alfred preferring to go to Coddingtons Cove to bathing.    Thee will observe that I\u2019ve been getting about as much good   out of boating as possible this season.  Since we arrived   Alf has become a staunch friend of Geo. Merritt\u2019s and Hazen   of Geo. Barlow\u2019s. Its quite remarkable how devoted Alf isCOMMA   he spends the big parts of his time at the reading room with   George.  This morning I got a new key fittedCOMMA formy valiseCOMMA having lost the other since my arrival.  We were   not able to mail these letters in time to go by the [La---]   so they will have to take their chance by going via New   York.  There are 24 folks going to Philadelphia the night we   goCOMMA which will make a pretty effectual change in Mary   Williams\u2019 boardersCOMMA and there will be no one left but Tom   Longstreth to do the honors of the occasion.  We are rather   puzzled as to what to do if we were left by the 7 o\u2019clock   train from New YorkCOMMA since the 10 o\u2019clock train has been   taken off the line.  We will have to run the riskCOMMA I   supposeCOMMA of getting the 8.40COMMA Washington trainCOMMA stopped at   Frankford.

However it was very interesting if not very late news.   Thee does\u2019nt say a word about having got either of my last   lettersCOMMA  I hope the one containing my elaborate sketch of   the Environs of the city & my room as a centreCOMMA did not get   lostCOMMA as it wld. have been a waste of artistic   effort.<br>The presidents death has indeed made mourning in   our land.  The ways of Providence are very inscrutable.  I   told you in my last letter of the feeling produced hereCOMMA so   I will notrevert to it..  The day of the funeral procession here was   very solemn.  We dismissed our schoolCOMMA & went by particular   invitation to where we cld. have an excellent view of the   whole as it passedCOMMA at the store of an old gentleman in   market stCOMMA where we had a room to ourselves & refreshments   provided wh. seemed rather singular but is his custom.  It   was the most touching & mournful procession I ever saw    Perhaps you saw it in Phila.  It will take a long time to   forget the grief & horror of this sad eventCOMMA\u2013 but work has   to be done & yesterday our sch. began [afresh] after the   interruptions of the week beforeCOMMA & while sch. lasts we are   forced to forget every thing but the work before us.

We dont   get any good Mrs [Mcaff--] [----] [butter] &c \u2014 excepting   when we get invited out to our rich frds.<br>I was perfectly   charmed with my visit at Carey\u2019s last 6th day night.  Their   place is perfectly magnificent & the house keeping   altogether princely compared to this.  I went out in the   afternoon & returned next morning.  Their house situated on   the tip top of a [very] hill seems like something up in the   airCOMMA & the view splendidSusan Carey has gone to Phil. & expects to return next 7 or   2 day.  She very kindly offered to bring anything for me \u2014   said she wld. have room for any sized bundleCOMMA so that I   might get my silk skt.  But it is so late in the season that   I think I can do without itCOMMA & I shd. not like to ask her to   bring so large a thing.  I wld. like tho\u2019 to have my old   blk. silk body & I wish thee wld send me a little brown   grenadine bag of horse hair in the right hand corner of my   upper beaureau drawer.  These things however are not very   importantCOMMA & you need not send them if inconvenient.+    [+Perhaps you can send them by T Miller instead.]  S Carey   stays at Anthony Kimbers cor. 13. & Arch.

We left West P. in the boatCOMMA the rest of the way up   the Hudson was not however nearly so interestingCOMMA we soon   got out of the Highlands & then it seemed very tame.  This   is the most magnificent place we were everCOMMA or are likely   everCOMMA to be in; The view from the front of the house is very   extencive & beautifulfrom one place we can see the top of Mount Washington with   the opera glass.  The house is quite a large one tho\u2019 mostly   old fashioned except the parlor wh. is up stairsCOMMA & has I   think most probably been altered the passages are the most   intricate I ever was inCOMMA & sometimes I feel completely lost.

We passed through what they   call \u201c[Pudding]\u2013stone Hall\u201d a large cleft in the rocks   formed of pudding\u2013stone & also through the lemon-squeezers   another crevise.  We are altogether enjoying ourselves very   much I think & propose staying here till 3rd day afternoon   when we will probably leave for Saratog[a]COMMA & thence to Lake   George.  at least those are present prospects but as we have   changed our plans several times to day I wont say certainlyCOMMA   if we p[u]rsue the plan now proposed wewill stop at Belloes Falls on our way to Boston & spend   next 1st day at Nahant if we can.  We have rather a funny   time altogether about our meals & sleeping apartments here   things are not extremely cleanCOMMA & it is so crowded we have   to come to the second table & therefore have to take our   breakfast at ten & dinner at four & now about 6 the supper   bell has rungCOMMA but I \u2018spose we\u2019ll come second class there   to.

We did not get home till after they   had gone to dinner so were obliged to go in just as we were   in our mountain dressesCOMMA & as we were all prepared concluded   to go under Tom\u2019s guidence to visit Bastion falls   afterwards.

At first we thought it   would only be a little showerCOMMA & took shelter under the   trees as there were unfortunately no overhanging rocks \u2013   this did very well for a little whileCOMMA but instead of   stopping the rain got harder & harderCOMMA & at last began to   find its way through the trees & onto us \u2013 we soon found   ourselves getting very moistCOMMA & began to confer on measures   of reliefCOMMA it was at length concluded as we were already   quite wetCOMMA & there was no sign of stopping to start for   home.

I don\u2019t think we any of us suffered for it thoughCOMMA & I did   not even feel tired in the eveningCOMMA this mountain air is so   invigorating.  Yesterday it rained perseveringly & we had to   amuse ourselves as best we could readingCOMMA & walking on the   piazza.  The company here is not as congeneal as we could   wishCOMMA & we often envy Aunt Annie & Cous. Clem in their   Adirondack society.  One young gentleman regaledus last night with some Scotch songsCOMMA but it was very   inferior to Carry Rowland\u2019s performance.

Uncle James went off to Harrisburg on Monday      as did Uncle Clem George Emlen John Thayre (my cousins) and      Cousin George Biddle.  Uncle Clem never told a soul that he      was going and on Sunday night when John went to the      Baltimore depot to see Gerge Emlen and John Thayre off to      his surprise he saw Uncle Clem.He was going off without bidding us good-bye when perhaps we      may never see him again.

Cousin Sam Cox was called to a churchthere (St. Paul\u2019s) and he accepted.  He left town two weeks      from yesterday and when he arrived at Cincinnati he was not      allowed to enter the city but was sent to a boarding house      about two miles from the city.  There he is now with his      wife children and father.  Of their furniture they know      nothing and are not allowed to go to the city to see about      it.  Every morning at five o\u2019clock all the bells in the town      ring and every man who is able to carry a gun assembles in      some perminent place and from thence they go out into the      country to wait for the enemy.  Even clergymen are forced to      fight & Cousin Sam is in almost hourly fear of being made to      serve.

Or   purchase them with the monies they Receive for their goods\u2013    Their Best market for these cattle is found at Philadelphia   & notwithstanding the circuitous Route they are obliged to   take & the most miserable & wretched Roads which alone Exist   to this market they Drive Annualy cattle sheep & Horses to   the amount of One million of Dollars\u2013 (I [think] this season   of Horned cattle alone that near if not quite 1/2 a million   of Dollars in value Has passed By this place & through the N   & South Road  at least I am persuaded that I may rely on the   account I have Received of the number) \u2013 if then it be a   fact that near one million of Dollars in cattle sheep &   Horses reaches Philadelphia Every year from the State of New   York and that for want of a Road from Philada- to the   Western part of that state \u2013 the whole Sum is Drawn in cash   from Philada and goes to the City of New York & there is   Expended in the purchase of Merchandize Because of good   waggon Roads Connecting that City with the Said western part   of the State \u2013 will it not be apparent thatOur Road in Truth is a Philadelphia Turnpike & well Worthy   the Patronage & Support of every liberal minded Citizen\u2013    But that this is the fact Every Drover will admit & I   beleive that they will very generaly declare that they would   much rather purchase their merchandize in Philadelphia than   in New York if it were possible to waggon [their] goods   through Pennsylvania to their Homes\u2013  at least this is the   Sentiment expressed to me as far as I have conversed with   them \u2013 in addition Then to these facts \u2013 I may state That   Though Cattle forms perhaps a principal Remittance from   Store Keepers in the Western pt of N York\u2013  Yet it is not   the only One \u2013 a good deal of Cash also is brought Down by   these persons & this cash also goes to the City of New York   which would if our Road was made Remain in Philada\u2013<br>I may   State too without fear of contradiction that this Cattle   Trade in despight of Obstacles Has constantly & rapidly   increased that in spight of them it will increase & that if   nothing is done to Counteract the Evil we shall still   continue to pay to the City of New York for the Beef we Eat   \u2013 or in other words that the Philadelphia merchant. shall   continue to pay the New York merchant for the whole amount   of cattle Driven from this quarter to Philadelphia\u2013  an   Enormous Annual Ballance Indeed for this one article of our   Consumption \u2013 again \u2013 This Highly Interesting Section of the   State of New York \u2013 [is] Hourly increasing in Wealth &   Importance \u2013 in wants of Foreign articles & Resources of   Domestic Wealth \u2013 And let me ask where can the merchants of   Philadelphia Find a Body of such customers as exist Here \u2013   where Such a certain& constant Trade\u2013  Where such an increase of Trade where   such certain remittances\u2013  Presenting also at Least one   Million of Dollars per annum Being Drawn out of the City at   this Time & How much Hereafter it is not possible to   predict\u2013  This However may Be reasonably [assumed] as a fact   \u2013 that if such now is the amount of this Trade with all the   difficulties which want of Roads present \u2013 a good Road will   very materially increase it \u2013 in [----] to Enumerate the   advantages to be reaped by Establishing a Free communication   with this Most Fertile Section of New York would more   properly form a Volume than suit the limits of a Letter\u2013 Yet   I may add that This Cattle Trade \u2013 though in itself of no   mean Importance to Philadelphia is only One amongst many   Valuable Blessings which New York has taken from   Philadelphia By the Superior Foresight of Her Citizens \u2013   There it Has been Esteemed Honorable & not unworthy the   attention of Her first merchants to Examine in to The   Internal Resources of Her State as well as of Her Sister   States \u2013 whilst the [reins] of Philadelphians Seems to Have   Been almost altogether Turned Towards the Sea \u2013 to Maritime   ports & Latterly to the Great Western Waters\u2013  Yet what   assisted to raise Philadelphia to Her present prosperity &   Rank more than all other Things was the Internal resources   of Her own State & those Sections of other States within   marketable Reach \u2013 and it is only as these Blessings   multiply & Have facilities given them to Extend to & Support   Her that She can on any Just grounds expect to advance \u2013 If   this possition is True & if I Have notfailed in making good my ground of the Vast advantage of communication with a Section of the State of New York to Philadelphia is not our Road in Truth a Philadelphia Road & entitled to the Best wishes & aid of that City\u2013   in the Magnitude of the Advantages to Be reaped from the State of New York through the Medium of this Road ???

New York City is By these Roads Establishing to Herself a Course of Trade which Though Now Easily Diverted from Her to Philadelphia is growing every day more & more difficult ??? a Timely Exertion an application of one mite of the Vast money Resources of Philada at this time in aid of this apparently insignificant Road will do more than the Expenditure of much Greater sums on Seemingly much Greater undertakings   Our Road will cut the Milford & Owego Road & the Coskectune & Great Bend Turnpike in so delicate a part that the whole Eastern Section of Each will be benumned & rendered lifeless ???

'42 <br><br>Dear Sister Rachel<br><br>We had so uneventful a journeyCOMMA I have been so quiet since our arrival hereCOMMA that I have scarcely material for a letter. Travellers are expectedCOMMA I believeCOMMA to be particularly entertaining. NowCOMMA there is no time when I feel less so. FatigueCOMMA change of air & dietCOMMA always for a timeCOMMA affect my health unfavorably; and thenCOMMA the turmoil & bustle scatter the little wits I possess. So thatCOMMA from homeCOMMA I am an especially stupid correspondent. StillCOMMA as you were kind enough to wish to hear from usCOMMA and as we exchanged promises about writingCOMMA I will not wait for any thing worth sayingCOMMA --as I may not have it at allCOMMA thee knows; -- and my delay may occasion me the disappointment of not receiving hereCOMMA the speedy return letter from Fourth StCOMMA which is to be my reward.-- <br><br>We had quite a pleasant time so far as TrentonCOMMA for our first day's exploit. We arrived there about half past five o'clock; and George with our baggageCOMMA via. steam-boat and rail-roadCOMMA very shortly after. In the eveningCOMMA we made a little visit to Elizabeth GummereCOMMA who lives near the Hotel. They have a fineCOMMA large houseCOMMA in a pleasant part of townCOMMA & express themselvesCOMMA the young folksCOMMA most emphaticallyCOMMA pleased with their change of residence. As we were in the immediate neighborhoodCOMMA we went with Eliza..thCOMMA to spend a few minutes with our old friendCOMMA Judge Gordon's wife. She looks and seems just the same asI recollect her in the days of my childhood. So it appears that in this bustling lifeCOMMA there are some not easily jostled out of their way. We found the JudgeCOMMA some years agoCOMMA busy with his attempts to sell his map of New Jersey. It still seems a most interesting theme to him; & if we come this way six years henceCOMMA I dare say he will even then be ready to speak of its merits & to state that his stock is not yet exhausted.-- Fifth day night brought us within twelve miles of the mountainCOMMA and the next day at noonCOMMA we reached the end of our journey--and over such roads! I was thinkingCOMMA perpetuallyCOMMA of the children's song \""Here we go upCOMMA upCOMMA upCOMMA & here we go downCOMMA down\"" &c &c. To adopt little Cary's favourite styleCOMMA the rain had washed such gulleys in the roadsCOMMA & the stones were so bareCOMMA & there were so many of them!-- <br>The first two days after we got hereCOMMA we had three or four showers per day. By way of consolationCOMMA we were toldCOMMA this was a favorable specimen of their weather this season. For the previous ten daysCOMMA it had rained all the time. \""Recorder [Vaux?]\"" who is hereCOMMA calls it temperance weather. I wonder if [Espy] is a tee-totaller.--We were beguiled COMMA when we first cameCOMMA into taking a room in \""the cottage\"" Its superior dimensionsCOMMA privacy &c were warmly insisted upon. And as we like plenty of roomCOMMA and don't like much noiseCOMMA we thought it quite a prize. The sun shone so flatteringly upon the [compact?]COMMA that we never thought of the inconvenience of being drenched in going to our mealsCOMMA or having them drenched  in being brought to us. As we have now had ample opportunity of trying it both waysCOMMA and don't relisheitherCOMMA we begin to murmer. Coming in search of HealthCOMMA we fancy tooCOMMA that a sleeping apartment on the ground floor is not exactly the place to meet with her ladyshipCOMMA this damp summer. We have some of the inconvenient \""[Fine-ear]\"" familyCOMMA moreoverCOMMA next usCOMMA who have been very near getting us into a scrape. A grand-daughter of John Jacob Astor has been stoping with a Mr KaneCOMMA from AlbanyCOMMA andCOMMA under what her friends considerCOMMA very aggravated circumstances. They came here to spend the Honey moonCOMMA & unfortunatelyCOMMA were placed in the room adjoining ours. Job related to meCOMMA one dayCOMMA in a confidential tone of voiceCOMMA the history of their flightCOMMA as just detailed to him by Governor Coles. This they contrived to over-hearCOMMA & being displeased thereatCOMMA they imagined a series of questions and answersCOMMA-- Job & I being the speakersCOMMA-- about the pedigreeCOMMA personal consequence &c of many of the boardersCOMMA which they carried directly to the individuals about whom we were said to be so curiousCOMMA & from thereCOMMA they came immediately back to us. HappilyCOMMA they fixed upon people whom we knew perfectly wellCOMMA & thus the absurdity of our asking who they were whom we had known all our livesCOMMA was sufficiently apparentCOMMA & created only a little merriment. But we were somewhat annoyed until we discovered the full extent of this eaves-dropping. ThusCOMMA the storms withoutCOMMA & the treachery within doorsCOMMA have given us a thorough distaste to this part of the premises. BesidesCOMMA there is more of a crowd than we wished to get intoCOMMA & if the company does not diminishCOMMA we shall want to try some quieter region. DirectCOMMA hereCOMMA howeverCOMMA as we shall leave instructions for letters tobe sent to us. -- We have had it very warm & almost clear now for a couple of daysCOMMA & have been enjoying it by driving about. The country is sufficiently beautiful to render the slow climbing of hills by no means a tedious affair. The roads are kept in quite tolerable orderCOMMA & occasionallyCOMMA we come to a level piece of ground where we trot away quite merrily. People tell us wonders about the flush gained and the disease lost among these hills. I hope our cases may add to a reputationCOMMA so richly earnedCOMMA according to all accounts. -- I should write to CarolineCOMMA but I am not a very disinterested letter writer; sowing only where I may hope to reapCOMMA --& I fear she is scarcely yet at home.--I should like muchCOMMA to know how you all areCOMMA where you now areCOMMA & where you are to be for he next few weeks.--Does thee know where Father & Mother are & when Cara returns?

As we were informed that it would be impossible to procure a place in the stage without waiting at Harrisburg a week & probably 2 weeksCOMMA we in company with two others engaged a hack to bring us to this place.  The expense was no greater than the stage hire & the travelling much more agreeable.

It commenced raining just as we entered the town & continued with little intermission during the next [---].  On fifth day morning the clouds were broken & promised fine weather.  We accordingly determined to cross the mountain to McConnell [-] if it were possible to procure a chair.  Our landlord discouraged us so much from attempting it in that manner that we determined to try it on horse back.  What dost thou think of Henry's riding in the saddle to the distance of 21 miles & returning the next day over one of the highest mountains in N. America.  It was his own determination for I really was afraid to encourage it.  The experiment however succeeded to admiration & we are here again without hurt or damage.  We had a noble prospect from the top of the mountain.  We both kept journals which will serve to give you some account of our proceedings.  Tomorrow morning at 6 o'clock we are to leave this for Hagerstown.  We travel more like express riders than pleasure hunters.

Although as respects the article of pleasure I am entirely satisfiedCOMMA yet I have concluded it would be prudent for me to remain a few daysCOMMA perhaps a weekCOMMA longer.    The party I came down withCOMMA all return tomorrow; should I return with themCOMMA I shall have been here but six days & have bathed but five times.  This can hardly be called giving the water a fair trial.  Thus far I do not know that I have received any benefit; some of our boarders tell me they think I walk betterCOMMA but I am myself sensible of no change.  We board much farther from the surf than is agreeable to meCOMMA but it was impossible to procure quarters in the home nearest the shore.  On the whole I do not much regret itCOMMA as our accommodations are much better than can be had in the other houses.<br>The party we attached ourselves toCOMMA engaged a large room with a bed for each and a stipulation that while we occupied it no others should be admitted.  This party consists of Merritt CanbyCOMMA Jos. AskersCOMMA Ellis YarnallCOMMA Robert BarnesCOMMA (a brother to the doctor) Richard Nixon a young englishmanCOMMA and a very clever fellow & our two selves.  When they are gone we shall shift our quarters into a small apartment.  With respect to the employment of our timeCOMMA it is sufficiently monotonousCOMMA and I fear next week will be still duller.  This however applies to myself.  Those who are well find employment enough in gunningCOMMA fishingCOMMA walking &c.  I was one of a fishing party to-dayCOMMA which as it will form  one of the most memorable events of my excursionCOMMA deserves to be noted.  The packet boatCOMMA General Jackson has a day to spare here on each tripCOMMA & to-day she engaged to take as many as chose to goCOMMA out to the banks to catch sea-bass.  A more delightful day for the excursion could hardly be conceived.  It was neither too hotCOMMA too coldCOMMA too windyCOMMA nor too calm.  We were unfortunate in but one particularCOMMA and that a main one.  We found no fish.  I was among the most fortunate and caught three.  One whole stock amounted to about four dozen.  At our greatest distance we were nearly out of sight of land; our fishing place was near twenty miles from shore.  William was afraid to go for fear of sea sickness.  As all the rest of our party wentCOMMA and I was fearful he would be sick myselfCOMMA I did not urge him.  I begin to feel quite sailor likeCOMMA as respects this said sickness.  I never felt better in my life.  A few of the party were very sickand several others complained.  Jos. [---] was the most severely handled of any person on board; he was really ill.  The most unpleasant part of our expedition was landing through the surf on our return.  We landed in a whale-boatCOMMA which was brought down pretty low in the waterCOMMA by the weight of her cargoCOMMA consisting of twenty-three persons.  We rose safely over the surf till our prow touched the beachCOMMA when it broke over the sternCOMMA rocked us very much & shocked several.  Jos. {----] had his hat knocked off & was amazingly frightened.  McAlpinCOMMA the [-------]COMMA in riding to shore on the shoulders of one of the boatmenCOMMA upsetCOMMA horse & rider.

How or where we shall live when we go homeCOMMA I do not know.  Indeed the uncertainties of the futureCOMMA & what it will be best to doCOMMA often weighs upon my mind.  Connymead is no placefor any body to live who wants to be a FriendCOMMA or who has any preference for their ways.  Life there was a continual struggle wh. I have no desire to renewCOMMA & perhaps we shall never know again [ever/even?] that semblance of a home.  I hope if thee and Lily picked to bring your children up as FriendsCOMMA you may be able to keep them in a community where Friends live.  For it is pretty hard for a young person who has been uninstructed in what are considered the accomplishments of life to have to live where these are considered all importantCOMMA & are the chief recupations of those by whom you are surrounded.

We reached here the 6th of MarchCOMMA having left Mentone 2 days beforeCOMMA passing one night in Genoa & thence by the midnight train to Rome.  This being the only train (owing to their very insane & uncomfortable arrangements) wh. gets you here at a respectable hour.  It was a very uncomfortable journey- but then we were coming to- Rome!!  We made a sojourn of two weeks onlyCOMMA at Dr. M\u00fcllers- Mentone we thought lovely- Dr M\u2019s house not altogether so.  It is not happily [---] being at the end of one of thos dried up riversCOMMA down wh. torrents of cold airrushed from the mountains.  We thought it much colder & damper than either Cannes or Nice.  & then there was a slight suggestion of boarding school about the household arrangements- & most for much open warfare between the Dr & his spouse to be altogether agreeable.  It is a great pity they have not learned to control their tempers a little in the presence of their guests at least- for at times it was rather to peppery to be pleasant.  Fortunately the storms seemed to be not very lasting.  & they were generally jolly enough- & in fact much more jolly then most people would be who were at their wits ends to make two ends meet.  A lady who was staying there with her family (pretty much as a matter of charity I fancy) told me they were over head & ears in debt & that she had come to the conclusion there was no use in trying to help themCOMMA as they never cd. keep any money- altho' they ask a very high price for their accomodations.  The excursions at Mentone were truly lovelyCOMMA & the Dr. was alwaysready to take us.  In fact we thought he quite preferred the ladies to the boys for he seemed quite put out once or twice at our declining to go.  but they were too hard for meCOMMA & I did none of the very long ones.  I shd. think however for those who were up to that sort of thingCOMMA Mentone would be one of the most delightful of the Riviera townsCOMMA tho' each one of them seems to have its own peculiar charms.  The weather was very warm when we got to RomeCOMMA & took the back bone out of me terribly- It however soon changed from mildCOMMA to coolCOMMA clear & bracing & the last 10 days have been delicious- I never was able to do so much walking in Rome beforeCOMMA & on spring afternoons such as these what luxury cd. be greater than to drive or to wander at will among the ruins all golden in the light of the declining sun- or to watch the funny old models in their gay rags & tatters- (wh. seem to [---] the spirit of the twins-) hanging themselves out on the Spanish Steps to be admiredwith all the rest.  Surely there is no place on earth like Rome.  Last first day was the kings birthday & there was a grand review- & the king & queen & the [---] kindly [---] themselves COMMA to our admiring gaze in the Borghese. It was quite too gay & disappointing to be proper for 1st day.  The usual ceremonies of holy week begin to dayCOMMA wh. is Palm Sunday.  We did not attend at S. PetersCOMMA thinking last year it was rather a sell.  I went to the little Italian [Waldensian] ChurchCOMMA a great contrast indeed to the pomp & [---] of the great Cathedral.  We had got back to our old Hotel della PaceCOMMA where we were twice last winter.  We went first to another but did not like itCOMMA & so came hereCOMMA where we found some friends of last summer (the M\u00fcllers).  It is a good central situation.

Is it necessary in order to effect a division of our property (I mean such a division as shall give thee thy portion at Connymead) is it necessary that I return to America in the Autumn with C & ACOMMA as it has been our intention to doCOMMA (or at least theirs)?  For myself I have not entirely decidedCOMMA tho' we have partly paid our passages for the 6th Nov. in the steamer \""Illinois\""COMMA on condition that we can change if it seems best to another vessel of the line.  It is late to sailCOMMA but there seemed to be no good steamer between the first week of October& the lastCOMMA & as there will be no moonlight the last of October we thought it wd. be best to wait until the next moon.   <br><br>   There are many reasons why I shd. like to return in the AutumnCOMMA but the prospect of boarding in Phila is not very attractiveCOMMA & of keeping house at Connymead still less so- indeed I shd. never be willing to undertake the latter again unless circumstances were very much changed.  C & A prefer the former.  If they were willing to keep house or even to board near GermantownCOMMA where we could have the enjoyment of the childrenCOMMA I shd. come home with the greatest pleasure.   <br><br>   But this I expect they will never wish to do.  So that until I can think of some way for me to live in that part of the world.  It seems as if I might almost as well stay here- for boardingin Phila wd. not be much better as far as you are concerned.   <br><br>   The thought of staying by myself seems a little dismalCOMMA but I cd. stay very well in the family where we now are & be as well cared for as I cd. expect or wish to byCOMMA by strangers.  Then there is an elderly lady (whom we have met several times (& I think have spoken of) Miss WetherillCOMMA Jno. Price Wetherills dhrCOMMA of Phila) who has asked me to join her partyCOMMA consisting of her niece & [Pebers?] of Phila.  We were with them 8 weeks in Rome & found them very pleasant.  So I could stay very well if I wanted to- Tell me how the idea strikes youCOMMA with regard to the business- asCOMMA if my presence is necessary to the accomplishment of itCOMMA that wd. decide the question.   <br><br>   We still continue in Geneva & still continue to like exceedingly our french family.  We intended in comingCOMMA to stay a month & then go to the Mts.  But the weather has been almost too cool for anygreat heightsCOMMA & thisCOMMA so far (I dont know how it may be in August) seems a happy medium.  We have had a few warmish daysCOMMA but for the most part it has been a delightful summer climate.  Then too we have had so much gadding aboutCOMMA that we enjoy the quiet & the thought that we are learning something.   <br><br>   How often I wish I cd. have Agnes here for a few months.  It would do for herCOMMA what years of study at home cannot do for any body.  I never knew before how badlyCOMMA or rather how little we had been taught at homeCOMMA how to pronounce french.  Then too this is such a nice family where it wd. be so safe to place a child.  Their ideas about education are good- & they have so much simplicity in their ways & manners- they seem almost like those of friends.  The children have never been allowed to go to the opera or the theater- tho' they have oneCOMMA within a few doors of them.  Every evening before going to bedCOMMA we have a little \""culbe\""- Madam Duproix reads out of a big bible- & then makes a little extemporaneous prayer- so very simpleCOMMA that one cannot help but feel as if it came from the heart; After thisCOMMA we separate for the night with much hand-shaking and many \""[---]\"" & \""[---]\"" & \""[---]\"" &c- The great objection to the french is that they have to say so much about every little thing & are really too polite for comfort.  I think each person at the table says \""par-r-r-don\""- about 50 times at each meal (with a very great trill to the r- & a very great accent on the last syllable) if all this wasn't accompanied with real kindness of heart (as in this case) one wd. become \""very fatigued\"" of it.   <br><br>   We suppose that you are now at Montrose tho' we dont know it.  It has been a perfect age since anyone has written from Awbury.  I sent cous. FRC a letter containing a cheque about5 weeks since & having rec'd no acknowledgement fear it has been confiscatedCOMMA or that he is not well.

I think the want of learning displayed- could only have been a part of their plan to avoid detection- and not from real ignorance of the rules of grammar.

Spring has always been my favorite season- but in all its gaiety and animation- it could not spread a scene more showy or more varied than the one now before us- such a happy blending of colours- but we have no beautiful hills or fertile [---]- where nature at this season appears so prominently beautiful.

I think the young lady- with so many [trunks?] \u2013 must have played the coquette very skillfuly- to have secured so many offers in so short a time- she knew her power I suppose- and was determined to excersize it- at the expense of her numerous admirers- Before I close my letter I must not forget to acknowledge the receipt of two newspapers- sometime in the month of August- for which accept my thanks the tale which they contained (the title of it I forget just now) I quite admired.--  The other day I met with something which pleased me exceedinglyCOMMA in one of [Lardners?] papers.- It was an essay on lovers- and described the different kinds of loversCOMMA most admirably- I recognized more than one or twoCOMMA or three of my acquaintance in the descriptions.

The pilots if I recollect first reported the capturing schooner to be full of men & black sided- it now seems they kept so far away that they could not see whether the ship was bright sided- still they alledge to have distinctly seen the cross in her foretop sail- This circumstance is the most strikingCOMMA & yet it is possible that at their distance they might be mistaken even in that.  I observe a story has been circulate in NYork of an oyster boat having supplied the ship at Sea- & that is believedCOMMA contradicted & reiterated- If that were true it wd. indeed be some comfortCOMMA as it might accot. for the whole affairCOMMA making some allowances for discrepancies.  It is altogether a painful subjectCOMMA & has caused me much perhaps useless anxiety.  but no benefit can arise from despondency.  & it is our duty to submit to the Divine Will- & our best interest too- Let us then hope while hope we may-29th<br>   <br>   The letter from Capn.

If the ship was in the situation mentionedCOMMA & at the time mentionedCOMMA it argues a most extraordinary degree of hardy hood in the Pirate.<br>   <br>   Yesterday commenced the battle on the Judiciary.  Judge Hopkinson opened the debate- in a masterly manner- he spoke for 3 hoursCOMMA & then gave way to a motion for adjournment- of course he will proceed with his argument 2d. day morning.  I hear it will prove unavailing- so many of the Convention being resolved on a change.  The discussion will no doubt be protracted thoughout all this weekCOMMA perhaps even another- so many will try to distinguish themselves on this fruitful subject.  Feeling so much disappointed by the issue of the militia question I can no longer hope for much good from this Convention.  Indeed I care very little now how bad they may make a constitution- the worse perhaps the better-as the people will be the more likely toCOMMA reject it.  Earl made his appearance yesterday and forthwith commenced taking notes of Hopkinsons speech- He will attempt a reply- so will I suspect Ingersoll- but the most powerful antagonist will be Woodward- from Luzerne.  He is plausibleCOMMA argumentative & fluentCOMMA but with all a thorough radical & in my judgement a most mischevous politician.

Newport are fine- but we have too much dust- the grass is nevertheless very fresh- & the fields are beautiful- We visited a tract at Brenins PointCOMMA I side of the IslandCOMMA & skirted by the Ocean- & a more fertile splendid farmCOMMA I do not remember ever to have seen-  They use the seaweed abundantlyCOMMA as a manure- & also a fish called Manhayden- dragged from the Ocean by netsCOMMA & sold at 14 Cts a Bbl- They are very oily- but I do not admire the filthy practice of strewing them over the fields to contaminiate the air-  The bathing here is very good & Job & I use it freely- while mother & E continue their purifications in the warm salt bath-  Among our numerous lodgers we have had Abraham Knickerboker & wife- He the lineal descendant of the true Dietrich- & has his residence at the very spot described by IrvingCOMMA whose description he says is very correct-  He is an intelligent and well informed manCOMMA speaking the English fluently- & his wife interested us very muchCOMMA by her smiley faceCOMMA he goodly appearance & good sense-  The good man himself is out of healthCOMMA & his loving spouse seems very uneasy abt. him-  On leaving us they each gave us a cordial invitation to visit them at their home in the romantic poetical village of Schaghticoke-<br>     <br>   While writing Elenor bids me say- you have among youCOMMA used her [---] badlyCOMMA in not even noticing a Letter- wh he took trouble- pains taking man- to endite to some of you- but as she has stepped out- I do not know when manufacturedCOMMA nor to whom directed- Cara\u2019s epistle of odds & ends- like this of mine- has been receivedCOMMA & wasCOMMA for her comfortCOMMA very satisfactory-<br>   <br>   Having in council duly convened decided to go by the Baloon to morrow.  I have come to the conclusion to rest for the present from my labours- to resume if needs beCOMMA in the morning but not until I say that we this afternoon paid another visit to the afflicted family mentioned before- none of them are better- the mother indeed much worse- she seems destined we think to take her departure to a better world very soon-<br>   <br>   26th<br>   <br>   A bright cool air promising a pleasant [---] to Providence- A boarding House forms a pretty good epitomy of life on a larger scale- One generation passeth away & is succeeded by another- so old faces depart [---] & new ones present themselves- In all things said the great Apostle I am instructed- & so we may be even in this day- did not time hurry us with such Rail Road speed as scarcely to permit us more than a glance- Among our imates is a certain Judge Balch of FloridaCOMMA a thorough going Loco- & reviler of sacred things- He attempted to show that the creation was the result of natural causesCOMMA combining & operating on each other- Moses' account he calls a fictionCOMMAthe mere offspring of a fervid imagination.  He abounds in anecdote- mostly I suspect the product of his own fancy- His atheism offended Knickerbocker much- it shd. be Knickerbacker- marble baker-  I joked & talked politics with the Judge for a while- but finding when hard pressed he became rudeCOMMA I quit it- yet shd. be amused with his profundity of discourse could I have faith in his word-  He stated for instance that he had furnished the Bk. US. with the first list of Directors for the branch at Nashville- all of whom \""Me. Biddle appointed\""- He did not however know that while making this statement to me & others he was addressing a manCOMMA who had been not only a Director of the Parent Bank at the timeCOMMA but chairman of the Cme. of electionsCOMMA who alone reported all nominations of branch directorsCOMMA to the BoardCOMMA & who knew the statement to be untrue-  I did not undeceive himCOMMA but left him to the enjoyment of his own fiction.  We had a short visit from a mercht. of Havanna- Cpa!  Clapp of the House of DrakeCOMMA & Co an intelligent manCOMMA whoCOMMA inter aliaCOMMA gave me a piece of information entirely newCOMMA at least to myself- He says that a company of individualsCOMMA Spaniards & othersCOMMA residents in Cuba have purchased a large tract of sand from a native PrinceCOMMA in AfricaCOMMA 150 miles square- wh. is to be cultivated with Coffe Sugar &c for commerce- the natives being the Labourers- should the designs of the Comp.y be honestCOMMA & fairly carried out- it will carry out Buxtons SchemeCOMMA & prove a great blessing to Africa- but considering of whom the Co. is composedCOMMA I cannot avoid fears.  C says the Coffee Plantations in Cuba yield but 6 or 7 Pct. while their Sugar Plantations give them 10- the slaves working 14 hours of the 24- The labour is so severe that when suspendedCOMMA to take foodCOMMA he has known the slave to fall asleep while on his feetCOMMA & prefer restCOMMA even to eating- the waste of life is consequently great.<br>   <br>   The change in the weather has produced its usual effect- my E has a headache but will doubtless be better when the sun advances- by the way we have had but one or two foggy mornings since our arrival-  Job & I mean to experiment on a warm bath this morning deeming the sea air is too fresh for our skins-  Love to all- & sympathy in the bargain for any that have tooth ache or the like-<br>   Thos.

I should have been quite disappointed if thee had not written to me and would like to think that there was not much debate in thy mind about it or at least that inclination took some part in it. Thee would give me a great deal of pleasure if thee would write often good long letters and thee may be very sure that I shall be interested in every thing thee chooses to tell me of thy doings and thinkings.

Such moderation & forbearance when in powerCOMMA was hardly to have been looked for from a mobCOMMA I have also a more exalted opinion than ever of La Fayette. His expressions on the subject of ye punishment of deathCOMMA as well as some othersCOMMA show him to be a man of enlargedCOMMA benevolent & enlightened views. I was rather prepossessed in favour of the late KingCOMMA both his personal appearanceCOMMA & from his having used power with moderation & clemency. But I think it is clear that the present age is too enlightened to submit to ye control & influence of bigotryCOMMA or to consider Kings & rulers as super human beings. On ye subject of anti-masonry as recently agitatedCOMMA I have been slow in forming a decided opinionCOMMA considering that the tyranny of ye people may be as great as that of ye monarchCOMMA & being much averse to all species of intoleranceCOMMA whether practiced by rulers or people. ThereforeCOMMA though I have no partiality whatever for the Masonic Institution or SocietyCOMMA I think it admits of consideration & reflectionCOMMA whether ye mode adopted for attempting to put it downCOMMA is ye most properCOMMA admitting that it may be ye most effectual. There are cogent reasons for objecting to all secret associationsCOMMA but thisCOMMA does not appear to interfere with the rights of others. In ye Morgan caseCOMMAI do not think theCOMMA Institution at large is concerned or implicatedCOMMA & therefore I do not think it quite fair to use it as a handle against masons as a body or community. Providence in its wisdom appear sometimes to permit good to come out of evilCOMMA & it maybe so in ye present instance; but I cannot subscribe to the Machiavellian doctrine that the ends justifies ye means; nor can I believe all ye heinous charges that are made against ye masonsCOMMA when I see among them men of patriotismCOMMA intelligence & benevolence. I think ye purport of some observations of General WashingtonCOMMA in a letter to one of his friends is that the Masonic SocietyCOMMA is a harmless & ridiculous Institution. This I should supposeCOMMA from ye opportunities that I have had of judgingCOMMA is a correct opinion. Please say to FatherCOMMA that I have received the deed for Milton HarrisCOMMA & ye present to him my warm acknowledgement for the kind expression contained of sympathy as I have [received] from my city friends & relatives. They rob misfortune of much of its afflicting power & effect. I had expected that a residence in the country would afford more mental quiet & invite more to mental culture than a City life. But I find that ye excitement caused by the bustle of preparationCOMMA which I though would be but temporaryCOMMA still continues. And whether it arises from the habits of calculation that I have acquired by my mercantile educationCOMMA or from those implanted in me by natureCOMMA I cannot divest myself entirely of the uneasy sensation caused by ye idea of a continual outlayCOMMA without ye prospect of an adequate return although the amount of ye outlay would sound very smallCOMMA to a merchant or banker. I am ready to fear sometimesCOMMA that my present practical habits & pursuitsCOMMA will lead me too much away from the school of fancyCOMMA sentimentand moral & religious reflection.

I understood he was not in the battle at the time he was shotCOMMA but was out some distance from the Army with a few others and ware met by about fourty Indian'sCOMMA who immediately fired at them and killed nine. I understood Johns Brother rode about a mile on Horseback after he had received three shots. One in his arm and two in his bodyCOMMA He was then taken off his Horse. But expireed in a few minutes after one of our neighbour's had his barn burned a few days ago by the lightening and his crop was all burned in it which was to him a considerable loss as he was not in very affluent circumstances. I think Friend Cope if thy double letter had miscarried and been broken open by any person he or she would of seen something in it worth a laughing at. I mean the part respecting thy beard. I understand thee is so tormented with thy huge beard that thee has been studying what thee should get that would kill it. But as thee is not likely to get anything that will answer the purposeCOMMA thee has requested thyFriend to take up a resolution and to good for evil (that is for pulling his whiskers) by contriving something that will answer the 8th purpose. but of should not think it a friendly act to destroy that which nature has formed as an ornament for my Friend.<br>   <br>   I am thy Friend Joel BailyWilliam D.

Aunt L & Ellie came the first time (I told you I wondered  which 2 it would beCOMMA didnt I?) & after theyhad been here about an hour & we had a good talk Dr. Stedman came up and said they would have time for a cup of tea at the [---] House (his house you know) & that Miss Stedman was there-  Mrs. Stedman was away unfortunately.

I was sorry Aunt Lilly didn't see Mrs. StedmanCOMMA but I believe they have asked her & Miss Stedman to lunch with them at Brunswick so they will meet after all.

Mary & Frank came on Monday & we had a jolly timeCOMMA & Polly is coming out with Aunt Lilly & Ellie when they comeCOMMA I think.  Frank will come againCOMMA toosometimeCOMMA I guess & I have found out that I can call him up on the telephone if I want to.  I had a nice little talk with Polly last evening on that instrumentCOMMA & a few words with Aunt Lilly.

Finding it was impossible to get our bags to Bude on the Sabbath we took the only course open and drove thereCOMMA  taking them with us.

From Clovelly we went to Ilfracombe by boat and thence we coached to Lynton. Here again we had expected to walk but were again preventedCOMMA this time by rain. Lynton and Lynmouth took my fancy very muchCOMMA and Paul Brown and I had a delightful walk up the Valley of the Lyn to Watermeet (where the East and West Lyn come together)The next day we walked to Porlock in spite of the rain.  We were very fortunateCOMMA howeverCOMMA and each time a shower overtook us we were able to reach shelter.  The darkCOMMA low-flying clouds with here and there a burst of sunshine rather added to the wildness of Exmoor and it was not hard to imagine that the Doones might almost still be living in some of the wild valleys.  We saw a herd of the wild Exmoor ponies but were not fortunate enough to see any of the red-deer which we were told at Porlock are not at all uncommon.  From Porlock we went to Tintern by train.  It was a rather tedious journey with a good deal of waiting.  The two place are only about thirty miles apart in a straight lineCOMMA but it took us six hours toreach our destination.<br>   <br>   Tintern Abbey is a fine old ruin and takes you back to the Middle AgesCOMMA giving the whole town an air of antiquity.

The Cathedral is fine but the Walls do not amount to very much it seems to one.  We left here First-day evening and went to Carnarvon where we were very much interested in the Castle which dates I believe from 1256.

It is such a quiet little townCOMMA \""far from the madd'ning crowd's ignoble strifeCOMMA\"" nestled in the heart of the Welsh MtsCOMMA that I felt I should like to have more time there.  In the afternoon it stopped raining and we walked down the Pass of Aberglaslyn where they say the cliffs rise eight hundred feet from the road.  It is especially fine now as the recent rains have filled the streams very full and the little brooks tumbling over themselves down the mountainsides are very beautiful.<br>   <br>   When we awoke the next morning we were again greeted by the pleasant patter of rainCOMMA but we decided to walk to Beltus-y-coed at any rate.  I am very glad we did as it soon stopped raining and it was a very pretty walk.  At Capel-Curig we again saw the king (we had seen him twice in London) this time in plain every-day clothes in an automobileCOMMA on his way to Carnarvon.  The people had gathered from far and near and greeted him enthusiastically.  I was interested to her them sing the Welsh national anthem in their native languageCOMMA which is certainly most unintelligible.  This morning we returned here and this afternoon visited the Cathedral after which Arthur and I went to see Eaton HallCOMMA the Duke of Westminster's place.  As he is now in London we were allowed to go over his houseCOMMA of course for a shillingCOMMA (everything is for a shilling) and were very much interestedto see how he lives.  It is a most magnificent placeCOMMA \""rich but not gaudy\"" and somehow seems much more \""fit\"" than some of the summer cottages at NewportCOMMA though I imagineCOMMA as far as money goes that Newport's \""cozy little cottages\"" are quite as grand.

I suppose thee is up at Woodbourne nowCOMMA having a fine time with Frank.  I can just imagine you getting up at some unearthly hour of the morning and kicking up such a rowCOMMA so that nobody else can possibly sleepCOMMA because you have caught a mouse or some other poor little animal in a figure four.  I bet Aunt Carrie was mad when you waked her upCOMMA I remember she always used to be.  Tell Frank I was very much shack[---] to hear of his playing such a wicken trick on Aunt Carrie.  I hope he has been severely lectured for it.  I think he must be getting very wild.  I wish he would write me a letterCOMMA but I suppose he has so many other girls to write to he would hardly have time to spare a few minutes to me.  I suppose thee sees from the top of thisletter that we are in Venice at presentCOMMA and I wish I could change places with thee for a minute or twoCOMMA and let thee see what it is like.  I am not very good at describing thingsCOMMA as I guess thee knows by this timeCOMMA if thee has [wadded?] through many of my stupid lettersCOMMA howeverCOMMA I will do my best.  In the first place it is very beautiful and very different from anything else that I ever sawCOMMA or that anybody ever saw I guess.  The Gondolas are perfectly fascinating.  They are all painted blackCOMMA and are long and narrowCOMMA with pointed ends curled up.  That's graphicCOMMA isn't it?  Never mindCOMMA I am going to draw thee a picture of one.There it is!  Thee sees the man stands at the back and works the boat with one oar.  It is more like paddling than anything elseCOMMA only the man stands up and throws himself forward on  the oar each time.  It is a very graceful motionCOMMA and they do it beautifully feathering the oar each time.  I never saw anything like the way in which they guide the great long boats in and out among each otherCOMMA and around sharp cornersCOMMA without any collissions.  It is really wonderful.  Oh!  Algie!  Thee gave me such a scare about Colin.  I really criedwhen I heard he was lost.  and when I read thy next letter and found it was all rightCOMMA I was too delighted for words.  Why I hardly said good-bye to the old fellowCOMMA and to think of not seeing him again nearly broke my heart.  Wasn't it queer his going off that way.  I hope he wont do it again.  We have gotten some lovely letters since I stopped writing and amoung them  was a paper tellingall about the Tennis TournamentCOMMA which Papa had sent to me.  I enjoyed reading it immenselyCOMMA & got very much excited over the descriptions of the different matchs.  I felt almost as if I was there seeing them.  Some of them must have been fine.  I would love to have seen the one between Hovey and young SearsCOMMA it must have been awfully exciting.  I am sorry poor Huntington was not in it this year.  I am awfully glad he won the doubles anyway.  Campbell must have played beautifully and you must just have held your breaths all through the matchbetween him and Hobart.  From what I gathered it was intensely excitingCOMMA wasn't it?  I can just imagine how sorry you were when Hovey was beaten.  I know how broken hearted I was when Huntington was done up last year.  It must have been something the sameCOMMA at least it says that Hovey gave out entirely in the endCOMMA and evidently was not wellCOMMA and that was just the way with Huntington.  Now AlgieCOMMA I must stop.  I guess thee is sick of hearing me talk about the tournament and will not be very sorry.  Good-night old boy!  Take a great big kiss and hug and all the love thee wants from<br>   Thy veryCOMMA very loving Sister. P.S. Please give my best love to AgnesCOMMA and tell her I am waiting eagerly for a letter from her.  Why don't it come?  Give Ellie my love tooCOMMA and tell her she is a perfect jewel to write to meCOMMA and that I will try and answer it if I can find time."", ""Gender of Author"": ""F"", ""Reference URL"": ""http://165.106.6.73:80/cdm/ref/collection/cope/id/3828"", ""Date"": ""1891-09-20"", ""CONTENTdm number"": ""3828"", ""Identifier"": ""hsc0742"", ""Recipient"": "" Francis Algernon Evans:  1878-1946"", ""CONTENTdm file name"": ""1959.cpd"", ""Subject"": ""Family; Italy--Description and Travel; Tennis; Transportation;""}"

With their long legs (only one of which they stand upon at a time) their necks which they draw well down between their hunched up shouldersCOMMA their grave or rather I may say melancholy expression gives them a ridiculous appearance and when they gyrate or give a great jump as they sometimes do with no apparent object it was perfectly [inesistable]-  The monkey house also proved a place of no small amusement-  as we visited it about 11 o'clock I suppose it was the hour for the old monkies to be taking their morning naps however that may be a number of them were asleep-  One old ape amused us very much he was taking a nap upon one of the bars and apparently the last idea that had entered his head beforefalling asleep was that it would be desirable to scratch his head so he would raise his arm until his hand nearly reached his head and then down it would dropCOMMA this he repeated over and over again-  In another cage there were three asleep upon one of the roosts with their arms around each other0  In other cages there were the usual pranks and absurdities going on which monkies indulge in. <br>   <br>   The keeper of the laughing hyenas was very obliging and gave us the opportunity of hearing \""the very remarkable noise\"" which the song informs us the animal makes every fifteen minutes\""- <br>   <br>   In the snake house every thing seemed to be in a very quiet state most of the snakes being coiled up  under their blankets-  One or two of the Boa Constrictors were tied up in sundry knots and laid out on the tree to sun-  We saw quite as much of them as we care to snakes not being our favorites-  We next visited the Hippopotomi and Rhinoceros.  The former are the most ungainly looking animals I ever saw.  There is a little one only eight months old and altho' so young its body so much longer than an ox.  The keeper brought some grass to feed them and made them open their mouths-  But I will stop for I am afraid I have said too much already about animals-  I think thee would be very amused at some of the servants we see here the absurd way they are dressed-  Not unfrequently5<br>   we see footmen with drab coats with brass buttonsCOMMA crimson breechesCOMMA white stockingsCOMMA low shoes and with either white wigs or powdered hair-<br>     <br>   The other day I saw an old fashioned coach by an old fashioned coach I mean one driven in the style of olden time four horses with a guard who had a long horn which he was blowing as they drove through the streets.  I believe it is owned and driven by a young lord who having plenty of money and a fancy for that sort of thing amuses himself in this way-  He has men to attend to all the money matters and to the passengers while he just drives-  Yesterdat we went out to the Crystal Palace and spent most of the day there-  It is a wonderful place so much to see-  It is something like our Sanitary Fair wasCOMMA if thee remembers thatCOMMA only on a larger scale.  We went around until we were very tired and then we dined.  After dinner we continued out investigations visiting amongst other things the \""[---] animals\""- These are large creatures made to represent what they suppose some of the extinct species were like-  They are placed about among the trees and on the edge of one of the lakes in natural positions but it struck us there was a good deal of humbling about it-  One sixth day evening last TomCOMMA RuebenCOMMA & I went to Parliament-  We couldnot get seats for Chellie and H as they told us they were often engaged a week ahead in the ladies gallery-  We had rather an amusing experience-  We reached the hall about five minutes of nine and were told we would have to wait for a few minutes as the  House was just being made up.  We were seated with a number of others upon benches in the Hall and after waiting for sometime the first was told it might go in and then the second-  We passed up a long flight of stairs and went into a little toom where our tickets (which Tom had purchased from a man in the afternoon) were examined we were in a bitter trepidation while this was going on as we did not know whether they were good for anything or notCOMMA however they passed us- As soon as weentered the gallery the janitor came to us and pointed us to seats into which we sank he then told us we must park our hats under the seatsCOMMA then he turned to another man and told him he must not raise up to seeCOMMA then he made another man put his umbrella upon the seat behind him not allowing him to hold it in his hand so if he had ordered us to pull off our shoes I should not have been surprised- We heard three or four speeches upon the Army bill and were very much amused-  Every once in a while the speakers would get rather muddled and there would come a succession of aws and grunts and hesitations which was absurd-  And then there were occasional mysterious sounds which at9<br>   last we discovered was applause in the shape of hear! hear!-  How they made such sounds I dont know it was a kind of mingled mumble and rattle it put me in mind of the child that swallowed the bead necklace-  We stayed until nearly half past eleven and then concluded we had got nearly two shillings worth and would go. <br>   <br>   This morning we went to Westminster meeting and were not a little surprised upon going into see Chas & Anna Sharples and their daughter-  After meeting we had quite a talk with them and learn that they are going to sail on the second of next mo:-  They have visited Vienna Switzerland France &c [---] trip ideed-  We also met Wm Bradford (the Artist) who is spending the summer in London) he was very kind and invited us to come to his studio-  Bevan Braithwaite was at meeting and pressed us to come and see him when we return a very warm hearted Friend.  We expect to leave tomorrow for the north-  Tell mother we are all pretty well-  Please give a great deal of love to father and mother and each one of brothers & sisters.  Tell them none must feel slighted when letters are not addressed to them individually for all our letters are intended for all.  Please give love to them at Uncle Johns & Toms also at School Lane.

We do so enjoy having Tom with us and he seems to be not only enjoying himself but improving--when he first joined us at London he looked very badly not having recovered from the sea voyage I suppose he was very pale and thinCOMMA but has been gaining pretty steadily so that now his cheeks have quite a color and he looks fuller in the face than I ever remember to have see him--I do not think his leg troubles him muchCOMMA as he says it does not hurt himCOMMA and he walks about a good deal--we shall try to keep him from doing too much--<br>   <br>   I think Chellie seems stronger than when we left homeCOMMA as she is certainly able to walk more and does not get as fatigued as she would at home--<br>   <br>   She has gained some flesh but is not what you would call stout yet. For a day or two her throat has been a little swelledCOMMA but I shall get her some [tannin?] or a gargle and I think that will relieve her. I have written [---] particularly in regard to health as I know thee would like to know. The weather except a few days in London has been cool so that we have generally not been able to wear our [thin?] clothes. Chellie has not found her waterproof dress to wear for traveling and now that we are going north shawls are called into acquisition. Evening 9.05. I wish thee could look in upon us this evening and see how snugly we are fixedCOMMA seated around a centre table in our cosey little parlor with four candles burning upon on the table and at this point Tom came in and proposed we should take a row upon the lake in the moonlight and as it was a lovely evening we went and now have just returned--I did wish for some of the girls form Awbury for it was so perfectly beautiful that even the [staid manied?] people almost grew sentimental--The lake was just rippled by the gentle wind and the moon was hanging over the western mountains throwing a silvered path across the waterCOMMA and on the shores we could dimly see the outlines of Wray Castle and the pretty residences with which the shores are studdedCOMMA and in which the lights were brightly shining. The rain which continued most of the day stopped toward evening and although the roads were rather muddy we started out for exercise and had a pleasant walk of three miles toward Bowness. [---] tt has cleared we expect to start early tomorrowmorning for Keswick. As this letter is for thy information on little points in travels I will tell thee of our general hours. We find it suits us best not to dine later than three or half past and so whether we take our dinner at the hold or elsewhere try to have it at that hour. We breakfast generally at half past eight and then take tea at half past seven or eight and spend our evening in our sitting room either writing home or in journals or in talking over the scenes of the day and planning for the morrow. In traveling we generally manage to have a car to ourselves and Reuben looks after the baggage and Tom eitherkeeps him or assists Chellie and HCOMMA while I am buying our tickets-  We get along very nicely indeed-  In the last letters thee said that some of them at home thought \""thee was writing too much\""COMMA I hope thee will not stay thy hand on that accountCOMMA but only as thy strength will warrantCOMMA for I can assure thee every detail of home news is very interesting-  We think of you very very often and I hope the time may come when thee will enjoy the beauties which we are visitingCOMMA but altho the present is so full of enjoyment the future (when we shall return to your midst) looks very pleasant.<br>   <br>   The little books dear motherCOMMA which thee gave us just before leaving are our constant compantions in our travels and it is pleasant to think as we read them morning and evening that thee too has them and altho the time may be different yet we read them the same day-  I enclose a little bunch of wild flowers which I picked while visiting Swarthmore part of them I gathered at the meeting house and part from the HallCOMMA I wish they were better preserved but they were pressed under difficulties in my pocketbook and I had to arrange them for pressing as we walked.  I send them thinking thee might like a little memento of Swarthmore-  I am afraid this will prove a scrappy letter and rather uninteresting for it is madeup of little nothings-  Hannah desires her love to thee and the rest of the Awbury family-  When thee sees them at School Lane please give them my love also a great deal to all at home and at Uncle Toms and Uncle John'sCOMMA Chellie has retired or would join me in these messages-  With much love I am thy loving son<br>   J.Evans.<br>   P.S.  I dont know if any mention has been made of how Reuben is and as his father and mother were rather anxious about him when we leftCOMMA will thee tell them that I think he is much betterCOMMA but would improve faster if he took more rest especially in writing his letters and journal as he often sets up late and is up early-  "", ""Gender of Author"": ""M"", ""Reference URL"": ""http://165.106.6.73:80/cdm/ref/collection/cope/id/4047"", ""Date"": ""1873-08-05"", ""CONTENTdm number"": ""4047"", ""Identifier"": ""hsc0835"", ""Recipient"": "" Anna Stewardson Brown Cope:  1822-1916"", ""CONTENTdm file name"": ""2178.cpd"", ""Subject"": ""England--Description and Travel; Honeymoons; Landscape; Letter writing; Voyages and Travels--Health aspects;""}"

We have had a very warm day the thermometer standing at 83 [degrees] a good deal of the time and there has been very little air stirring-  This morning MaryCOMMA Alexis AlfCOMMA John Hazen and Henry made an excursion to the top of Kate's Mountain.  They had an early breakfast and got off about 8 oclock and did not get back until nearly one.  They had a pretty rough scramble and some how did not get to the right place and so missed the view-  I was glad they went as they thought it paid and I am afraid they find it rather monotonous-  The life is a very lazy one and while it is so warm in the middle of the day there is very little to be done in the way of excercizeCOMMA with any comfort-  I think Alf seems better and the water suits him but Hazen is not able to drink the sulphur water and does not seemed to have impreoved as much as I hoped he would-  I do not mean that he is sick but he still looks pale.  He seems bright and much less nervous than when he left home and I hope he will improve more after his return-  Lily has bathed twice (yesterday and today) having her bath at about 100 [degrees] and says she thinks it suited her for after lying down she felt refreshed and better-  but of course it is too soon for there to be much change-  She stayed in the first day only about 2 minutes and today 5 so thee sees she is feeling her way.<br>   <br>   This afternoon Lily and Alexis took a drive-  I have been disappointed 3<br>   in the air here it is not bracing at all-  and as the mountains are all around us often we get but little breeze-<br>   <br>   The daily routine of our life here is not thrilling-  We rise about half past seven and it is often half past eight before we get assembled at the breakfast table-  After breakfast (which we rarely get through until quarter past nine) we walk around the grounds for a little while visiting the springCOMMA Japanese StoreCOMMA Post Office &c and then spend the time until 11 o'ck (when we bathe) either in readingCOMMA writing or talking-.  After the bath we put in the time as best we may until dinner time 2 O'clk.  After dinner we set out under the trees upon the lawn or upon our piazza and read aloud or talk until tea time and after tea we generally take a walk and then sit in the parlor until bedtime \""and thus our days go onCOMMA go on\""  The boys vary it occasionally by a little walk upon their own account or by going swimming or sometimes we roll a game of ten pins-  I have gone very much into details and I have no doubt father and Tom will laugh at the letter and groan over such a life (so do I) but I thought these little nothings would interest thee and moreover there is very little else to tell-  Our movements in the future are very uncertain and as yet we cannot say when we shall home or whether some will remain- as soon as some conclusion is arrived at we will let you know.

Since you went away I have been very lonely and not having anyone to play with have been with Kate and Lizzie most the time - Last first day week in the afternoon Lizzie went out and as there was no one about at home I thought I would go too she told me to \""go home\"" a great many times but I wanted to go so I wouldn't mind her but followed on - I wish I had minded her for I had a great deal of trouble - She went over to Germantown and went into a great big house I think I heard them call it a church I tried to go in with her but there was a man at the door and he would not let me in so I played around on the street for a while and then I got tired and another little dog came along and asked me to take a walk so we ran off together - After a while it began to get dark and I watned to go home but I found I did not know the way I asked the little dog with me but he said he never heard of Awbury and didn't know anything about it. He said he must go home and get his supper and go to bed or his mother would give him a whipping. I went on and on up one street and down another until at last I came to the railroad. I remembered the railroad ran by Awbury so I thought if I followed along that I would gethome. So I ran along as fast as I could until I came to the bridge over Haines St then I had to go slow. I want to tell you one thing never try to cross over a railroad bridge- just as I got over it I heard a noise and looked over my shoulder and there was a train coming I [hurried?] all I could. It kept getting nearer and nearer and I was awfully scared and the next thing I knew something struck me and I was knocked off the bridge and fell down into the street-  My foot and my tail hurt me dreadfully and I felt sore all over and I could not move and I just laid and cried and cried - after a little while a man came and picked me up and carried me into the little house right by the railroad - He was a funny looking manhe was almost black. I hear them say I was pretty badly hurt and I thought so too for I had pain all over me. I heard them say I had two of my toes cut off and part of my tail. They put a rag on my foot and tied up my tail and put me on the floor in the corner of the room and there I laid for more than a week so sore and stiff I could not move. Some little children came to look at me but they were black too and did not look like you then there was a little baby about as big as Edward and they put him in a kind of a boat and used it to rock him up and down. I had never seen anything of the kind before I thought it was very strange. I don't believe the baby like it for it used to cry a great deal and it used to make myhead ache to see the boat go up and down but maybe that was because I was sick. I think I heard them call the boat a cradle. The room where I was was not very nice and it smelt bad and was not clean. At first I was very bad and could not sleep or eat but just lay and moaned all the time and then the things they had to eat were not nice. As a I lay there I thought a great deal of the good times I had playing with you and wondered if I should ever get home and see you again - after I had been there about a week I began to feel better they would not let me go out. I used to hear the carriages go by but I could not run out and bark at them the way I did at Awbury. One day I hearda carriage coming and it stopped at the house where I was. I listened and thought I heard papa's voice and in a minute or two the door opened and he came into the room he could not see me for it was pretty dark and I was down behind the boat. Papa told the woman he wanted to see the little dog that they had found hurt so she brought me out and there was Grandpa too. They called me Buster and I was so glad to see them I did not know what to do. I jumped about all I could but I was still pretty stiff and my foot hurt me. They picked me up and too me out to the carriage and there was Uncle Tom and Alexis. Grandpa gave the woman a green piece of paper I heard them call itmoney and grandpa told the woman it was for the trouble she had had with me. I wasn't any trouble at all and I don't know what she could want with a little piece of green paper. Then we drove home and they were all so glad to see me. Aunt CarrieCOMMA nannyCOMMA Katy and Lizzie all made a great fuss over me and oh! I was glad to get home. I wish you were here. They gave me some supper and I heard them talking about me. They said I was very dirty I don't know how I got so for I have been in the house almost all the time and didn't go in a ditch once. They say they are going to give me a bath tomorrow (I wish they wouldn't for I hate baths) and they say I will soon be wellthey think. And then when you come home wont we have jolly times playing together. I think I can run just as fast as ever even if two of my toes are gone. Well now I must stop for I am tired and can't write any more. They say Scott has got the mange or something that sounds like that. I haven't seen him yet but suspect he will be down in the morning to see me. I send you my picture herewith that you may see how I look now. Do you think I am changed much? The family say it is a very good likeness. With lots of love I must say goodbye. Do come home soon. Your loving - \""Buster\""-<br>   <br>   P.S. I hear a cat outside oh! my if I could only run the way I would chase her for I don't like cats.

Altho I sent thee a postal from NY this AM for I am going to post a few lines the afternoon. I reached Philada about half past one and found the weather very different from Newport. The thermo. hanging by my side as I write standing at between 85\u00b0 and 86\u00b0 and the air somehow feels lifeless. I came away in such a hurry at the last that I forgot several things. Tell Hazen we need not have hurried if we had know for I waited nearly an hour before the boat arrived. I carried of the Post office key which I enclose herewith. I think sister Ann has my pocket knife which I lent her yesterday morning and either Algie or Edward has my [rule?]. These last I do not need and you can keep them until I come on or until some one is coming this way. I forgot to tell thee that I wish that bucket of solution of [copperas?] poured down the kitchen sink and then lit John put about two double handfuls more of it into a bucket of water and let it stand for about a week and then pour that down and put about a pailful down any week. I wish thee would call and see Truman Pickham some evening as you come home from a ride and ask him about the well and the drains I went to see him but he was not at home and he is at work except after six in the evening or between 12 and 1 at noon. I had not time to call again. If the cow you have does not prove satisfactory get Hazen to see what Ward will rent his cow for he did not tell me definitely and if he would take 4.00 per week I would take her if this one does not prove satisfactory.I do hope my dearest thee will take things easy. I am afraid the care will be so much that thee will not gain much and please do remember that it is my special wish that thee shall either have extra help or have the washing done out or anything that will [unnerve?] thee. I wish I could be on hand to help and relieve this. I do hope you are all well and are getting on comfortably. If I was only sure that the well and the drains were all rightCOMMA I should feel much more happy. I hope they are and have done all I know how. I fully intended to have brought on two of those [Appolinans?] bottles full of the well water for Reuben Haines to have examined. I wish theewould send them on by the first opportunity. Please give my love to the two Annas and Hazen and with lots for the dear children and thy own dear self. I shall try not to worry about you but leave you in the care of our loving Heavenly Father who I feel has been and is very good to us and to whom we should give our love and thanks.

Dear little boy I am very glad to hear he is better and it was very thoughtful and kind of thee dearest to telegraph. We are going along very nicely at home. Tom and Alf and I had dinner at 7 o'clock last night and it was very nice. We had fricasseed chickenCOMMA potato peas and [beets?] and then raspberries for dessert and tea was on the side board and we each took a cup at the close of the meal. We then adjourned to the piazza at about 8:15. <br>   <br>   [We?] weather is very pleasant the thermo. at my side as I write marking 86\u00b0 at this hour 3 PM. I was very much surprised to hear of the death of Hannah Newhall. She is to be burried to morrow at 2 o'clock from our house.  I was tired last evening and so did not go over to call until this morning I found Abby and Mary in a very resigned? and very cheerful state. They said they did not regret at all having moved out and were glad of it. They said they were afraid we would not like to have the funeral from our house and hoped there mothers death then would not cast a gloom over the house for us-  I assure them that it would not in the least and that I was very glad they were going to have the funeral from there-  Abby said the great heat of last week seemed to prostrate their mother and she gradually sank away until third day morning she quietly ceased to breathe without struggle-  Ally said she was leaning over her at the time doing something and her bother had her hand closed upon a handkerchief and she said she noticed her hand gently relaxed and ther handkerchief dropped this was all that markedthe change.  William Newhall was there and he told me he was so glad his sisters had such a place to stay in and Abby and Mary both seems so glad they were when they were and not at a boarding house or hotel.  They said it had seemed like home to them from the very first day they move out.  I sent them some flowers on my way to meeting.  They want me to be on hand at the time of the funeral to do some things for them so I shall go out in the 12 M train.<br>   <br>   We had a good meeting this morning Cousin James and Samuel Morris spoke-  Cousin James came to me after meeting and said they were so much obliged for our kindness to Anna &c-  I am better dearest the pain in my back is almost entirely gone and my [---] is less.  Tell Mother we concluded it would be more polite for me to call on Lena so I drove over there before meeting and invited her to come over and stay sixth day night with us and she accepted-  Nancy left last evening going into town at 7 o clock.  Everything is moving along very serenely so far as I know.  It is fun to see Tommy studying [---] and Paramous book at the breakfast table getting up a menu winding up by saying \""Well!  I hate this business\""  My dearest my thoughts are with you a great great deal and I do hope thee will take care of thyself and that you all may be better.

I am very glad to hear you are all well that is the family and am sorry the maids are not so. What seems to be the matter? And does Dr. Cleveland think either the sickness or the children arose from the Water? I am very sorry dearest thee has had so much trouble about the water and it seems to me a keg will not be large enough for daily wants for drinking and cooking and as it is a very very large one and if not it seems to me it would be better either to get Stephen Barker to hand a hand daily or to make an arrangement to hire his wagon and harness early every morning and for John to go for it. I hired the wagon and harness to go into Newport for 50c and he would probably make a much cheaper price for everyday arrangement. The water at the new reservoir is to be filtered through eight feet of sand and unless this arrangement is completed I should doubt whether the water would be any good. I wish dearest that I was there to help thee. What seems to be the trouble with the maids [---] get along amiably together? I [---] remember me to each of the [---] I hope they are enjoying the summer and trying to do all they can to help thee out in my absence.

And now dear I wish to thank thee for the sleeve button studs and Collar button they very pretty and thee knows from the way I size upon thy buttons I need some of my own. I believe or rather know that I have on at this minute a pair I gave thee. It is quite warm this evening a real August night warm-sticky  And sultry. Reuben brought me this afternoon the analysis of the water and I am very much at a loss what to say. Thee had better show it Dr Cleveland and see what he says it seems to me that if the water was boiled and filtered for drinking and cooking there could be no possible dangerCOMMA but ask him. Dear me I am very sorry there has been so much bother about the water. I do hope you keep will and that you may be found to do so until your return which does not seem say far distant now. Alf and Maggie I believe send on word by George about their prospects. I hope Anna will be able to go on with them for she does not seem very well and Newport seems to suit her. Now dearest I want to say a word or two to thee about thyselfPlease do take can of thyself and take all the rest thee can. I wish thee had less to do or that I could give thee more help.<br>   First day morning. Well dear we are promised another warm August day. Fog early this morning and the thermometer now stands at near 80. I am glad you are out of it. We are all pretty well this morning I have nearly regarded my usual standard and with a little further can in my diet think I shall be all right. I am very sorry dear but I never remember the money thee asked for to be sent on by George. I will try and remember to send it on by Alf. I hope thee can borrow of mother or George so as not to Be entirely poverty stricken. My dear wife I feel drawn very near and close to thee in love and most ardently do I desire for myself that I may grow in grace and that we may be more and more united as a family and grow together in good things.

I went out home at 1:15 and we had dinner at 2 oclock and I drove father over.  he went to Cousin F Yarnalls to tea and I drove home-  Hazen drove over to Cousin F's and brought father home-  They funeral was very large- but I did not see one of Susie's relatives there but myself-  The services were conducted by Reverend Watson assisted by Dr Coil and F Yarnall and one or two other ministers were in attendance-  There was no sermon-  The hymn sung was \""Asleep in Jesus\""-  After the funeral I spoke to Cousin Elizabeth and Wistar and sent a message of love and sympathy to Susie-  As you may not have heard the details of the death I will tell you as we have learned them.  The cause of death was a blood clot upon the brain.  the Dr also found one on the lungs-  They (Chas [Wheeler?] and Charlie) were rather late for the train and were running to catch it just as they got to the Washington Markets Charlie who was a little ahead of his father looked back to see where he was and saw him stagger and then fall he was unconscious and was carried into the Market house-  A doctor was immediately sent for but Chas Wheeler died just as the Dr arrived.  he lived about 15 minutes after he fell.  The body was then carried to the Station House little Charlie going with it.  He had to remain with it until 7 oclock in the evening and attend the inquest and undergo an examination answering many what would seem to us knowing the circumstances [---]questions such as whether his father was drunk and whether he was a drinking man &c &c-  What a terrible ordeal for a boy 14 years old.  At the funeral yesterday he looked very badly like an old man.  Susie arrived about 7 oclock in New York and Charlie then joined her and they came on- when they arrived at Bryn Mawr through some mistake they were not met and Susie and the four Children had to walk home about a mile and a half at between 11 and 12 oclock at night.<br>   <br>   I believe Susie expects to return today to Newport.<br>   <br>   I am rejoiced dear to hear of your welfare.  The weather yesterday was very oppressive-  It was the most trying day we have had this summer.  Today is warm the thermometer standing at about 85 at a little after 10 ock yet the air is not so steamy- and by the paper I see there is a prospect of cooler weather-<br>   <br>   Please give my love to mother and I am sorry to hear she is not well hope nothing much amiss.  Give my love to the children and with a heartful for thy own dear self I am thy loving<br>   husband<br>   J Evans "", ""Gender of Author"": ""M"", ""Reference URL"": ""http://165.106.6.73:80/cdm/ref/collection/cope/id/4284"", ""Date"": ""1883-08-21"", ""CONTENTdm number"": ""4284"", ""Identifier"": ""hsc0894"", ""Recipient"": "" Rachel Reeve Cope Evans:  1850-1939"", ""CONTENTdm file name"": ""2415.cpd"", ""Subject"": ""Death; Hymns; Funeral rites and ceremonies; Weather;""}"
