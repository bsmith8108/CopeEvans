I know   that thee has thought it strange that I have never written   to thee all summer. but one thing and another always turned   up. & [---] the days go by without doing so – now that I   really have something to tell thee perhaps it won’t be so   hard! but I wont go on like Elliston Morris – but will get   to the point of my tale which is simply that I am engaged to   Will Lewis!  The engagement is not to be announced for a   long time yet –  This is especiallyimportant on Will Lewis’ account and I am sure thee will   help us to keep it quiet and be very careful not to let the   children or anyone else suspect the truth!  It does seem   strange that I should be engaged to one whom neither thee or   Chellie know – but I Sincerely hope you will soon know him   and learn to like him as one of the family!  My happiness is   so complete that I can scarcely realize all that has   happened –  that what I have prayed and longed for for so   many months has actually come to pass and I am engaged to   him whom I have loved for so long a time – it has all been   Sosudden! the Change – that I feel as if I was in a dream &   cannot realize the truth!  Our own immediate families are   the only ones who are to know anything about it for the   present – so please be very careful not to mention the   subject –  I really think it would be better to talk about   it as little as possible – for ""little pitchers have big   ears"" thee knows! of course thee won’t have anyone to talk   to about it now.  but I meant especially when J and R. go up   & after you all got home.<br>The mail is about to go –& news is scarce at present – so I wont continue scrawling.   <br>With love – I am thine <br>very   affectionately<br>Carrie.",http://165.106.6.73:80/cdm/ref/collection/cope/id/714,714,10641717122002_hsc0025.cpd

Not that   I’m so very busyCOMMA but since I lie down every noon when I get   home from bathing in timeCOMMA and in the evenings we have Mary   Williams’ lamp incased in the same little plain bonnet so   that we have no chance either to write or read after darkCOMMA   unless we take a lamp and go up stairs.  <br>On 6th day we   ordered the boatCOMMA but were not able to go outCOMMA on account of   the rain.  In the morning Alfred had the pleasure of   witnessing a little sail boat upsetCOMMA the man who was in it   managed to get on the bottom untill a sail boat came to his   assistance.  In the afternoon the rain slackened some and we   made up quite a large party and hired the omnibus to go to   the south Shore and see if the horn spoutedCOMMA we had George   and thecarriage beside.  When we got there the horn did not spout   at allCOMMA but the waves were very fineCOMMA and towards the latter   part of the timeCOMMA when the sun came outCOMMA very beautiful the   sun shone on the spray making nearly half of a rainbow.  We   staid till quite late stopping on the way home at the   boathouseCOMMA the sea there was not nearly so fine though.  On   seventh day morning we made up a small fishing expeditionCOMMA   consisting of AlfCOMMA HazenCOMMA Tom LongstrethCOMMA George and myself.   We went about a mile above the poor house anchoring in a   little cove near the rail-road.  We had quite good luckCOMMA and   caught about 24 fishCOMMA including 2 star fishCOMMA several   ChaucksusCOMMA and one very fat eelCOMMA which I had the   gratification of catching.  Since we have been here we have   seen two very curious fishCOMMA one called an “old maidCOMMA” which   is about 1 foot long and white underneath; the other is a   “swell fishCOMMA” and looks very much like other fishCOMMA except   when you turn it over and rub it gentlyit becomes inflated and is puffed out like a small   air-baloonCOMMA it is about 6 inches long.  The fishermen on the   point have had a reading room and small library established   for their benefit in a back room looking out on the bay at   “GodderdsCOMMA” (I don[t] know whether I have spelt it right or   notCOMMA but if thee pronounces it the way its spelt thee will   know where I mean) by a Miss or Mrs. Gibbs.  They take the   daily and some of the illustrated papersCOMMA and I noticed a   number of the “British Gardiner” I think it was on the   table.  Well to come to the point at once; uncle Harry was   invited to deliver a sort of a lecture to them on last 6th   day evening.  George Merrit seemed very desirous that the   ladies would come up and hear the discourseCOMMA which some of   them did.  The speech was very grand the subject being   “WaterCOMMA” I dont know whether the fishermen properly   appreciated itCOMMA since I heard one remark afterwards thatCOMMA   “it wouldtake a purty smart man to follow him.”  I believe uncle   Harry proposes to deliver some more during this week on   Light and Air.  20th 3rd day.  Yesterday we took a sail over   to the Dumplings and landed those that wanted toCOMMA the rest   of us going on downCOMMA towards Bever Tail.  This morning we   proposed sailing around CanonicutCOMMA recruits came in slowly   since they had been all finished by the expedition to the   Light shipCOMMA however as it turned out there was not enough   wind and we had to defer it untill tomorrowCOMMA and go bathing   instead.  This afternoon mother contemplates going sailing   if George thinks we are not going to have a squall; at   present it looks very much like rain.  I suppose Mother has   told thee all about the storm they have been having at home.   I hope we’ll not have it here.  And now since I have used up   my sheet I will stop.  affecty thy son<br>T.P.

Had I succeeded in seeing thee at that last callCOMMA I   should perhaps have had little to say but <br>I had not presumed on tasking thee with any perusal or   examination of this MS.

I   could not but be conscious of my own appearance of   insensibility; but I may humbly and thankfully assert that I   was and am at least sensible of having a fixed object in   livingCOMMA which reaches even to the relationship of such   comparative strangers as thou and I must as yet confess   ourselves to beCOMMA and which is even necessaryCOMMA (coupled with   confessed infirmity) to account for some show of   vacillationCOMMA or spasmodic irregularity. For instanceCOMMA I hope   not to leave the world without doing something to the   formation and definite recognition of an ""inner circle of   friendship"" in which superlative epithetsCOMMA such as ""dearest""   &c. will not be regarded as necessarily exclusiveCOMMA and into   which a subtle form of witchcraft whichI must not here particularize (for the BibleCOMMA as the   Westminster Review justly claimsCOMMA ""must stand or fall with   the doctrine of Witchcraft"") shall not be able to enter. And   how difficult must the steadfast upholding of such a   doctrine be in a community whose Social CodeCOMMA and whose very   theory of the familyCOMMA commit it to the assumption that   universal tithe shall be the weakest rather than the   strongest! <br>I am not now sure but that like one of old I   shall have to appeal from ecclesiastical indifference or   oppositionCOMMA to the ""Cesar"" of public sentiment.

So you can judge of our horror when a few min. before      setting outCOMMA this dreadful intelligence was brot. to us. The      feeling here against the seccessionists has been intense as      they have been heard to rejoice in the sts. at thedreadful newsCOMMA & to have prophesied a few days since that   our rejoicings wld. be turned to sorrow.  The city was under   martial law for a day or two – but by the strict vigilance   of the authorities was kept quiet.  but they compelled every   secessionist as well as union on the principal business sts   to drape their stores in mourning & [if] the appearance it   presents is very solemn & sad.  I suppose it is the same in   Phila. – & everywhere.  It seems really a more horrible   thing than some we have shrunk frm. reading in books of   history.

Fine breeze- Band tuning up for a   song before we reach the pier.  Arrived at the pier at   5.P.M.  On first day evening we took a walk to Tammany Hill.   we started after a 6 o’clock tea but were not able to get   there untill dark or dusk.  It is the first time I was ever   there.  We saw the lights at Point JudithCOMMA the Light ShipCOMMA   Bever Tail and the Break water.  Yesterday was splendidlyclear.  In the morning we took a short floatCOMMA I cant call it   a sail there wasn’t any windCOMMA after which we went bathing.    In the afternoon I made up a small sailing party consisting   of Alice CarterCOMMA Abby NewhallCOMMA Tom Longstreth and AlfredCOMMA we   went out to the Dumplings and landedCOMMA & afterwards came back   to take Caroline Mary her first sail.  She could’nt have had   a more pleasant evening it neither too cold nor too warmCOMMA &   there was a splendid breeze.  We went around Rose Island and   got back in good season.  though not strictly obeying her   mothers instructions about being home at half past 6.  This   morning we went bathing as usual and also engaged the boatCOMMA   Alfred preferring to go to Coddingtons Cove to bathing.    Thee will observe that I’ve been getting about as much good   out of boating as possible this season.  Since we arrived   Alf has become a staunch friend of Geo. Merritt’s and Hazen   of Geo. Barlow’s. Its quite remarkable how devoted Alf isCOMMA   he spends the big parts of his time at the reading room with   George.  This morning I got a new key fittedCOMMA formy valiseCOMMA having lost the other since my arrival.  We were   not able to mail these letters in time to go by the [La---]   so they will have to take their chance by going via New   York.  There are 24 folks going to Philadelphia the night we   goCOMMA which will make a pretty effectual change in Mary   Williams’ boardersCOMMA and there will be no one left but Tom   Longstreth to do the honors of the occasion.  We are rather   puzzled as to what to do if we were left by the 7 o’clock   train from New YorkCOMMA since the 10 o’clock train has been   taken off the line.  We will have to run the riskCOMMA I   supposeCOMMA of getting the 8.40COMMA Washington trainCOMMA stopped at   Frankford.

I hope by this time thee is      enjoying thyself on terra firmaCOMMA but since the difference of      time between where thee is and where we are is so greatCOMMA we      find it hard to guess what thee is about.  We received letters from home last nightCOMMA dated the 25th.COMMA saying they   were all well and preparing to leave for Newport on 5th day.   Mother had also received a letter from thee mailed at   Halifax<br>On last 6th day we rode to Stony CloveCOMMA an   entirely new place to meCOMMA about 10 miles distant.  The road   is quite roughCOMMA and runs between two mountainsCOMMA one of which   rises almost perpendicularly about 1000 ftCOMMA as near as we   could judgeCOMMA and on each side there are large rocks under   which we found ice: they say the sun never gets there and   the ice under the rocks never melts during the summer.  On   approaching this place the air becomes perceptably cooler   and on leaving it becomes warm again.  We took dinner at a   little farm house and although it was plain weenjoyed it very much.  After dinner we had to leave right   away for home.  Going back we had a splendid view of those   distant mountains you see on your way to the Plauterkill   Clove.<br>Yesterday morning weCOMMA that is Tom StokesCOMMA HarryCOMMA   some other gentlemen and myselfCOMMA walked down to Bastion   Falls to take a bathCOMMA thee remembers what a fine basin there   is at the foot of the fallsCOMMA well it was there we went in;   the water was pretty cool on first going in but after we had   been in a little whileCOMMA and had kicked around a good bit we   got quite warm and all in a glow.  We went under the fall   where it hit the rocks for a second timeCOMMA but even there the   water stung like hail-stonesCOMMA and I preferredthe pool to getting such a warming as that.  In the      afternoon we walked over to the Mountain House to see the      viewCOMMA on starting it was beautifully clear but when we had      gone about half wayCOMMA two cloudsCOMMA very consideratelyCOMMA came      rolling down upon usCOMMA one from North and one from South      mountainCOMMA and by the time we got to the precipice both the      view and ourselves were completely mistified; we accordingly      went into the House and got weighedCOMMA and since thee will not      object to hearing how much some of the members of thy      immediate family weighCOMMA I will give thee part of the      table:<br>R.R.C.  125 lbs.   E.S.C.  98 lbs.   T.P.C.  90      lbs.     Rachel has gained 7 lbs. since last sum- merCOMMA and its becoming quite dreadful; I'm afraidCOMMA if she      goes on gainingCOMMA we will be obliged to have her put up in a      barrel and roll her home from Newport.  Tom StokesCOMMA EllieCOMMA      MadjieCOMMA and Walter are going home tomorrow morning: the rest      of us expect to leave here fourth day and go to AlbanyCOMMA we      will stay there that nightCOMMA and go to Boston the next day;      leaving Boston 6th. day afternoon we will arrive at Newport      in time for tea.  I suppose mother has told thee that she      succeeded in engaging both the Georges during our stay      there.  The weather here has been very warm and showery; to      day it is very pleasant but it has been so very showery we      were afraid to try going to walk. Aunt Lizzie received two letters from the Adirondacks to      day one from cousin Clemmy and one from aunt AnnieCOMMA giving      an account of a trip which they had taken to lake Placid by      the way of John Brown's grave; aunt Annie said the grave was      very plainCOMMA there was a tombstone with some engraving on it      and on a boulder nearby was the plain inscription ""John      Brown - 1859.""  She also said cousin Clemmy was a good deal      stronger and was able to bear fatigue as well as the rest of      them  They were both very much surprised to hear of thy      sudden leaving for England.  Lilly and Chelly send their      love.  We are all well and have had a most splendid time      considering that our ""pa"" is on the other side of the Atlantic and now having given thee   all the news I can remember I will   stop.<br>affectionately<br>thy son Thos P.

Peter raised Tabitha (also called Dorcas)COMMA a      charitable womanCOMMA from the dead in the town of Joppa.  He      stayed there at the home of Simon the Tanner (today the      house is open for visitors)COMMA where he had his vision of      animals trapped in a sheetCOMMA which the Lord bade him to eat.       When he refusedCOMMA protesting that the Lord had designated      some of them unclean for consumptionCOMMA the Lord repliedCOMMA      “What God hath cleansedCOMMA make not thou common.”  Following      this visionCOMMA Peter visited a Gentile named Cornelius and      widened the scope of Christian ministry (then practiced      within JudaismCOMMA as it was considered unclean for a Jew to      minister to a Gentile) to include those outside the Jewish      faith.,English,Str. “Dalmatia”COMMA Oct. 28COMMA 1911.<br><br>Dear AlgCOMMA<br><br>I   meant or wanted to write to thee soonerCOMMA but thought I would   wait until we were really touching Palestine. I have my map   at hand in the case which thee presented meCOMMA and I think it   is going to be fine. So far nothing is blocking our plans –   neithercholera nor fanaticism aroused by war – and we are due at   Beirut tomorrow to go on to Damascus and take a two or three   weeks’ trip across country to HermonCOMMA GalileeCOMMA and SamariaCOMMA   and so down to Jerusalem. To-day we have been lookingCOMMA from   our shipCOMMA up at nothing less than Mount Carmel. Haifa as   thee knows is built at its foot and is of course very   picturesque. Part of the mountain’s sides is bare and brownCOMMA   ratherCOMMA but part is covered with small treesCOMMA carob and oakCOMMA   I believeCOMMA which isa very pretty sight. Six or seven miles up the coast we can   see Acre with all its crusading associations. And as we have   been thinking of some of the associations of Mount Carmel it   is of course intensely interesting. I have a fine pair of   number eight binoculars which add to our enjoyment   greatly.<br><br>Nat Groton and I get along very well. He is   very patient with me; my awkwardness and unnecessary anxiety   in giving fees must be a great source of trial tohimCOMMA but he bears it well. With all these fellows coming   after you and towards you and around you for “bakshish” all   the timeCOMMA it is very trying sometimes. Yesterday I had my   first – and I hope my lastCOMMA as it is not pleasant –   experience of being cursed up and down and out and out by   one of the fellows who brought us out again to the Steamer   from JaffaCOMMA for giving too little bakshish.<br><br>We went   ashore forpart of the day yesterday at JaffaCOMMA or JoppaCOMMA which was   our first contact with Palestine. It was not calculated to   be sentimental. The disembarking is not easyCOMMA for there is   no harborCOMMA and the rowboats are hard to get into from the   steamer. As I stepped downCOMMA the boat happened to sink in the   trough of a wave and I had the queer feeling of stepping   down into space.We were rowed in in a pelting rainCOMMA tooCOMMA which made the   little streets of Joppa literally inches deep with – not   mudCOMMA but filth. The old tomb of Tabitha was only discovered   recentlyCOMMA but is old. The “house of Simon the tanner” may   well have been in a different place from the one which is   shown you. But after you think it overCOMMA these things make no   difference. It is Joppa. And the tanner’s house was just the   sort of one which is shownCOMMA and hisbusiness was a tanneryCOMMA I suppose to make leather bottles   for water and wine. His house no doubt opened out on unclean   courtsCOMMA and he was contaminated in Jewish eyes by touching   dead animalsCOMMA swine at that. So where was a better place   than such a little houseCOMMA with its unclean factory in the   midst and its flat roof looking out to sea and its host none   the less hospitable for any of these thingsCOMMA for Peter to be   prepared for his wonderful vision? And in this needyCOMMA little   town Tabitha did live. And thesame intensely interestingCOMMA picturesque life goes on its   crookedCOMMA little streets and alleys to-day. We saw a man   sittingCOMMA grinding meal between an upper and a lower   mill-stoneCOMMA small onesCOMMA the upper of which he turned by   hand. We squeezed by long strings of camelsCOMMA and walked   through swarms of turbaned Arabs. There are lots of other   interesting things in Joppa which stay with you in spite of   the filth through which  you wadeCOMMA and the variegated odors   which assail your nostrilsCOMMA but I must stop now.

But Mother wrote thee I suppose all that was      necessary –  If thee will write to me a little nearer the      timeand tell us when & where to meet Mary Jane and her trunk I      shall be much obliged.  If she should turn out a      satisfactory nurse for the childrenCOMMA I should be very much      pleased.  Of courseCOMMA I shall be with them most of the time      myself tooCOMMA as I fear I belong to the [measy] class of      mothers.  We have beenwanting a Protestant nurse as my experience with the      Romanists is that when pushed to the wall they will      sometimes tell an untruth.  I thought of giving Mary J.      $2.00 a week for the first two months & $2.50 for the next      two.  Then if she should not wish to go home with youCOMMA & I      should wish to keep herCOMMA she would be entitled to full      nurse’s wages.  Won’t thee please tell me what that ought to      be?  The nurses from New York here get such an enormous      amount that I thought she might be willing to take what the      Philadelphia nurses do -  Her duties will be most of the      care of the babiesCOMMA the mendingCOMMA & a few things of the      baby’s to wash; this with her own wash & her own room will      be about all.<br>ThenCOMMA as we have never had a Protestant      servantCOMMA there is anotherquestion I want to ask.  Would she probably be satisfied to      go to Church in the evening regularly instead of 1st day      morning?  Then I could go myself in the morning – and what      shall I give her in the way of “days out”?  I don’t know      anything about nurses but our two other servants expect an      afternoon a week and most of every other Sunday –  Now this      wouldbe very inconvenient for a nurse to do; & if she would be      satisfied with any thing lessCOMMA it would be better.  I am      anxious to begin the way we mean to keep onCOMMA as changing      ones rules after once starting is not very easy to do.<br>If      it is not too much bother I should be ever so much obliged      if thee would adviseme a little on these points –<br>Baby [William] & I are      doing very well.  We think him a great addition to the      family.  The weather is not sufficiently mild yet for him to      don Anna’s pretty little cap & take a strollCOMMA but it will      not be long before we will both be out in the fields –<br>I      am so glad you are to be in the Dea’s [Cotage] this summer –      It is quite accessible from here & I shall often get hold of      Anna –<br>In haste Believe me<br>Affectionately      Thine<br>Joanna Sophia Buffum<br>Greencroft.

We got to writing in bed at West Point as we   woke up earlyCOMMA & were not going to take breakfast till 8   1/2; but we had to go at 9 1/2COMMA & as we were very pokey we   did not get down to breakfast till 9 o’clock-hence my great   hurry.  We left West P. in the boatCOMMA the rest of the way up   the Hudson was not however nearly so interestingCOMMA we soon   got out of the Highlands & then it seemed very tame.  This   is the most magnificent place we were everCOMMA or are likely   everCOMMA to be in; The view from the front of the house is very   extencive & beautifulfrom one place we can see the top of Mount Washington with   the opera glass.  The house is quite a large one tho’ mostly   old fashioned except the parlor wh. is up stairsCOMMA & has I   think most probably been altered the passages are the most   intricate I ever was inCOMMA & sometimes I feel completely lost.   We are on the very top of the mountain with dreadful   prespicise’s all around usCOMMA & it is the most dreadful place   to get up to that ever wasCOMMA thee knows its a twelve miles   drive up the mountain from the landingCOMMA & how long does thee   ’spose we were getting up? 5 1/2 hours- just think of it the   horses walked nearly all the wayCOMMA & stoped ever few   minut[e]s to rest; after we got fairly to the foot of the   mountain within about three miles from the house father &   Tom got out to walkCOMMA “& the consequence was” they got here   an hour & a quarter before us.the last part of the way poor RachCOMMA was dreadfully sickCOMMA the   boat & stage together were too much for herCOMMA & as soon as we   got there I helped her get right to bedCOMMA she slept pretty   well however after she once did get to sleep tho’ she   suffered dreadfully poor childCOMMA thee knows her headaches are   so hard to bearCOMMA but don’t worry she’s quite well to day.

We passed through what they   call “[Pudding]–stone Hall” a large cleft in the rocks   formed of pudding–stone & also through the lemon-squeezers   another crevise.  We are altogether enjoying ourselves very   much I think & propose staying here till 3rd day afternoon   when we will probably leave for Saratog[a]COMMA & thence to Lake   George.  at least those are present prospects but as we have   changed our plans several times to day I wont say certainlyCOMMA   if we p[u]rsue the plan now proposed wewill stop at Belloes Falls on our way to Boston & spend   next 1st day at Nahant if we can.  We have rather a funny   time altogether about our meals & sleeping apartments here   things are not extremely cleanCOMMA & it is so crowded we have   to come to the second table & therefore have to take our   breakfast at ten & dinner at four & now about 6 the supper   bell has rungCOMMA but I ‘spose we’ll come second class there   to.  We are quite glad of our thick dresses MotherCOMMA & have   worn nothing else hardly since we left home.  its right cold   to nightCOMMA & we have to wear shawls & things all the time to   keep warm.

This to be sure I had but a few hours to stay thereCOMMA   still I had hoped to spend part of them with thee.- I hope   dear Annie thee is better for thy sojourn at Newport. For I   know the return home without thy father’s welcome must have   been very painful.- even with all the love & kindness of thy   brothers & <br>sisters and with the strong consolation thee has of   believing that thy dear parents are forever “where adieus   and farewells are a sound unknown”.- May we realize more &   more the infinite importance of eternal things.- For myself   I seem to glide on day after day occupied with a round of   dutiesCOMMA but in a kind of lethargy in regard to spiritual   things Certainly without that earnest striving which is   commanded & which we may believe is essential to Christian   progress- But confession of our faults avails little without   amendment & I should not burden the with mine. <br>We have   parted with our Lizzie to go to Select school. She boards   with John and Sallie Hilles who very kindly offered to take   her- & so far likes her school very much better<br>than any she ever attended before. I loved that school very   much & whenever I think of itCOMMA always seeCOMMA in my minds eyeCOMMA-   thee & Julia & Clemmy coming in - &  going to the cloak   room.-<br>We miss Lizzie exceedingly & I am ready to wonder   how we shall do without her for six months.- She is to come   home after every monthly examination & I long for the time   to arrive.-<br>Has Clemmy been much with thee lately? I have   scarcely heard of her since her return from Baltimore or of   Julia for a long time- I saw some of George’s pictures   favorably noted in an “art criticism” the other dayCOMMA at   least I supposed they were his. George B. Wood is his nameCOMMA   isnt it?<br>How sad it is that Mary Ann Morris<br>continued so poorly- tho indeed it is not to be wondered at.   Mary wrote me a few days ago- that she was still much   afflicted with sleeplessness - &  was very nervous. The   former must be most distressing & very [wearing] upon the   constitution.- I hope cousin Eliza will be better for living   in Germantown as the trips out there have done her so much   good. It is to be hoped their walls will not tumble down   before they get moved tho [-----] does not think it would be   son fine &  exciting. – I think their house will be a good   way from you will it not? I am hoping dear Annie to spend a   few days with thee before a very great while- tho I cannot   now see when it will be – probably not for some weeks.- Tho   I do want exceedingly to see thee & as I said before fully   expected to before this. Please write to me when thee feels   like it.- Father  mother have gone out to teaor would said their love- Mine please to thy sister Lizzie &   a large share for thy self from they truly attached   <br>Susie-<br>,http://165.106.6.73:80/cdm/ref/collection/cope/id/774,774,575111717122002_hsc0060.cpd

We had them in   abundance at Father’s where we went 7th day evening sisters   Amelia & Hannah were there and several cousins went with us   besides Barclay and the country was so beautiful and so   sweet from the clover fields that it did seem to me quite a   treat – we left second day morning in the cars for New York   –  Came in the accommodation trainby the way of Amboy – it was new to me and I enjoyed it much   more than the other route by Trenton –  Last evening Solon   Robinson one who writes for the ""Tribune""* [*Is one of the   editors I am told] spent the evening with us he is a near   neighbour – he wrote the ""hot Corn"" stories for the Tribune   and lately ""a day in the country"" which appeared in that   paper – a singular looking man his age is 54 – wears a beard   probably 6 inches long and perfectly whiteCOMMA his hair also   long and white – he told us he had travelled with one pair   of horses from New Orleans to Chicago and from thence to New   York $5000 miles and the horses just ready to run away the   day after he got home – he described his attack of Cholera   on the Missisippi and of the enormous dose of opiumCOMMA Quinine   &c which they gave him of the former quite an ounce he   thought –  I told him of [Gimre’s] himaepathic potion!–  He   also mentioned an illness of the smallpox and said he had it   as badly as it was possible – upon my remarking that he was   not pitted with it he told me howhe prevented it by covering the pustules immediately upon   breaking with collodion –  Some of the pustules were as   large as a hickory nutCOMMA others smaller – but not a place on   his whole person where he could have put a quarter of a   dollar down with out touching some – we were entertained   with his conversation but did not admire him any of us –   quite eccentric –  I did not know he wrote the ""hot corn   stories"" untill he left – he was down on the beggars said it   was sinful to give indiscriminately seemed to think it was   no use to give to them that they could not be made to help   themselves – that they might as well die one time as another   which quite shocked us to hear him say – he has distributed   about $12000 and I suppose has become totally discouraged in   the prospect of doing any good –  He thinks almost all are   petty thieves –  Laura has had 4 articles taken that she had   put out with ashes in – knows not what to do – they will   take even a barrel and break up for firewood –  Thos Leggett   had their door mat stolen as well as Woodwards’ and the next   door the other side –  We have concluded to keep ours in the   hall as it has escaped hithertoEvery few minutes there is a knock at the basement door –    Robinson says ""let them knock and take no notice –"" does it   not seem queer that a man that could write so feelingly   about the poor should say so? – but indeed we know not what   to do scarcely and to feel that we do right –  I never saw   such a place –  One evening Thos Leggett was in here about   dark we were all in the basement and a poor little thin   creature like Katy came to ask for something –  Tom thought   he would go with her and see her home which he did and after   he returned he could not speak for tears – the scene of   utter destitution affected him so much –  The father could   not work had the ague and he thought that they looked as if   they had all become thin through want of food – she had been   coming here almost daily for food since –  This morning we   saw a group of little ones the largest girl carrying a box   which looked to be an ash box and Laura thought looking back   apprehen-sively.  We thought they had stolen it.  Robinson may feel   more than he pretends to about them –  We heard he wrote for   a long time ""City Items"" for the Tribune and they almost all   contained some interesting incidents respecting the poor –   he informed us he possessed remarkably  descriptive powers   that nothing he saw escaped his notice &c.  We concluded he   must be a genius and consequently eccentric – he told us he   had an adopted daughter that always shaves him – cuts his   hair makes  all his clothes with the assistance of a sewing   machine as well as all her own sewing and sometimes  her   shoes –  William thinks it likely she is one perhaps that he   has rescued –<br>We found Nealie here after we returned from   meeting we are all invited up there Seventh day (Barclay and   ourselves)– we expect to go if they get a cook–  A few days   ago an old servant of theirs dropped down dead whilst at   work in the kitchen which was a great shock to them they had   to have a coroners inquest – Laura says perhaps we will go   and take Martha tocook whilst we stay –  Laura has engaged the nicest little   girl to run errands do chamber work  &c – she does work   admirably  sews beautifully – irons &c  they think she will   suit them better than a larger girl – she is a trim little   thing with beautiful hair which she has always in nice order   – got a very good character of her – the gentleman she lived   with (a lawyer) wrote her character – that she was the best   child he had ever known in her capacity – they parted with   her in consequence of going out West –<br>I do not remember    whether I told you about the Cornell’s friends of Hannah   Leggett who board with them the elder (Eliza) has been a   teacher in one of the best schools in the city received a   salary of $600 – she is going to be married in about three   weeks to Albert Smiley.  she is a sweet looking girl as well   as a younger sister with whom Barclay has become  well   acquainted – JL Woodward is very much interested in them –   he likes young company – when Laura told his wife that she   thought perhaps some of hercousins would come home  with us – she said ""Mr Woodward   will be delighted""  We are to take tea there this evening –   Leggetts & ourselves –<br>5th day.  We heard that Mayor Wood   was obliged to accept warrants from the Metropolitan police   who accompanied by Gen Sandford presented them to him—he is   under arrest – I feel anxious to hear what has transpired to   day –  Lewis & William and every New Yorker I expect are so   much interested –  Wood has behaved  so badly –  It was   thought that Sandford had acted with great circumspection   and he was the hero of the day – but if the Mayor had not   submittedCOMMA he told him that the law would be enforced at the   point of the bayonet – happily yesterday passed without   bloodshed –  The mayor with his 800 policemen were in the   City Hall = It was suggested that they might be starved into   submission by preventing egress –<br>Well Anne dear I hope   thy foot will not trouble thee long it was the best thing to   take care in time of a sprained ancle – such a useful little   body as thee has become  cannot be spared very well –  Laura   joins me in love to all at Awbury – will write soon to thee   herself as I have more time on my hands I have taken the pen   this time and shall be glad <br>to have a reply –  I am   looking for an answer to my letter from Julia soon we do   enjoy getting letters so far away from all of you –Must now say farewell as my sheet is filled and remain as   ever thy very affectionate Aunt Martha",http://165.106.6.73:80/cdm/ref/collection/cope/id/775,775,575461717122002_hsc0019.cpd

But we can but hope for the best. Was it      not wonderful how suddenly & completely the Rebellion cam to      an end.

If aunt R’s health is improved - it will be   delightful for them all to be together. Would thee not like   to go if thee could do so properly? - I should exceedinglyCOMMA   but probably never shallCOMMA my life seems destined to be very   unadventurous and matter of factCOMMA - all for the best no   doubt.- Do Lilly & her Philip’slive in Germantown?

To teach a school of troublesome boys I   shd. say was one of the hardest businesses’s that cld. well   be got up..  The girls are bad enoughCOMMA but when it comes to   boys – – they’re the [---] of man.  I have in my school   about 35 boys & a dozen girls between the ages of 6 & 15 —   The girls I have but little trouble withCOMMA but the little   boys are regular monkeys.  No sooner is my back turned than   they begin their discussions of wh. they have a variety —    Its the hardest thing in the world to keep them stillCOMMA & if   they get a good chance there’s not one of them that is too   good to get up & takea dance or a fight or any other such little amusement that   they think will set the school in an uproar.+  [+ Throwing   spit balls is a very bad habit they have – also dancing “Ham   fat”]  My punishments are various.  Sometimes I shake the   culprit & if that wont doCOMMA tie em up hand & foot & put em in   the corner — wh. is a very troublesome operation to me.  But   it seems as if nothing wld. beat it into their heads that   school is any thing but a place to play in.  <br>Most of   them can read a little some not at allCOMMA & like “Busy” – they   must always spell girl gril and dirt – drit –.  It seems as   if it came natural —  One of their best accomplishments is   singing wh. we sometimes let them do in school.  My children   know “my”native country thee” & the colored “Wolunteer”— wh.   they shout out with great effect.

Evans.<br><br>In carrying out our   program for SwitzerlandCOMMA the weather has suddenly changed   from intense heat and a very long drought to a rain of   several daysCOMMA which while most grateful to the parched   countryCOMMA interferes materially with views of the charming   Lake of Geneva and the mountains that environ it. Instead   thereforeCOMMA of our usual outdoor lifeCOMMA this gives just the   opportunity for which I've been wishingCOMMA to acknowledge some   of the very kind farewell greetingsCOMMA received as we left our   native shores. The weather being so variableCOMMA it has seemed   best for one to remain in this most comfortable   Eng.-speaking pensionCOMMA with a delightful out-look upon the   LakeCOMMA while my dear Hannah has gone into the <br>upper regionsCOMMA so as to get into closer touch with their   sublime peaks--at least so far as the fickle weather may   permit. Meanwhile thereforeCOMMA my pen is giving me congenial   occupation in-doors.<br>Among the loving remembrances to   which I have referredCOMMA is thine from FranconiaCOMMA U. N. of   [--] 28--I was truly glad also thus to receive good accounts   from youCOMMA and can only trust your outing in the bracing air   of New Eng. may be permanently helpful to thyself and your   dear AnnaCOMMA of whom I often think with tender sympathyCOMMA   desiring that ""the best of Physicians""--may keep her under   his all-wise and loving care. Turning away thereforeCOMMA from   misgivingsCOMMA or fearsCOMMA or failures as they may seem to herCOMMA   may there be a more ""continual looking into Jesus""COMMA not only   ""as the author""COMMA but ""the finisher of her faith"". Let her   ever remember that it is this same Saviour of our'sCOMMA who has   begun his work of grace in her heart that seeks to carry it   on and perfect it<br>to his praiseCOMMA and her unspeakable peace. He knows her   better than she knows herself; and thereforeCOMMA none so well   as He can ""speak to her condition"". It is thus He has   revealed himself to multitudes of struggling soulsCOMMA and they   never seek His face in vain. Then it is that anxiety gives   place to a quiet childlike confidence in HimCOMMA and impatience   as to a more rapid growth in grace than we may have yet   known finds us more continually dwelling upon the abounding   love of GodCOMMA and brings about that ""patient waiting for   Christ""COMMA which the apostle craves for his fellow   believers.<br>While our best desires are turned in this   directionCOMMA there is nothing incompatible with the fullest   appreciation of the outward favors & blessings with which   our Heavenly Father has surrounded us. IndeedCOMMA we now   realize that these he has ""given us richly to enjoy"". We   recognize His good hand in them allCOMMA and so a continual   thanksgiving goes up from our hearts to HimCOMMA as the   all-bountiful giver. I see little to add to the few<br>hints as aboveCOMMA and would have thee to use them or notCOMMA only   as way may open--Indeed I can quite believe thatCOMMA if a   fittingCOMMA natural opening does not occurCOMMA it may be best to   speak to Anna of nothing beyond my continued loving interest   in her.<br>As to the results of our own ramblingCOMMA I may   thankfully say thatCOMMA for myselfCOMMA there seems a marked gain   in several respectsCOMMA butCOMMA as thou has intimatedCOMMA the full   benefit of such changes is sometimes felt later.

However Uncle H. thinks there will be no trouble in   getting them by writing afterwards.  We left Newport at 7   o’clock this morning & dined at Worcester very comfortably   about 2 o’clock & arrived here at 6 1/2 about.  Thishotel is delightfulCOMMA they say it is one of the best in the   Union Sallie Parish says “its where all the brides come toCOMMA”   I haven’t seen any yet!  We got a splendid supper & Uncle   Harry & Chell & I took a little stroll through the town  it   seems very pretty as far as gas and star-light would show.

Patty would do a great deal   better than the Girl I haveCOMMA and should she offer againCOMMA I   would not have thee entirely discourage herCOMMA but tell her   thee beleives the girl I have does not suit meCOMMA and if she   thinks she can behave so as to please meCOMMA thee would have   her call again.  It will be time enough (after theehas spoken to Doct. Evans) to come to any conclusion when my   Henry returns.

For two months or more we have not had a girlCOMMA the   one we had had since the fallCOMMA left without any notice   saying she was sickCOMMA a good general house-work girl is very   hard to getCOMMA and I dislike changing very muchCOMMA and I   proposed<br>that we should do without one till we went to PoconoCOMMA as the   old woman we have had there three years wants to go again.    We have to hire two or three times a weekCOMMA which does not   make our wages much lessCOMMA but it is a saving in other ways.    Of course it gives me more to do and keeps me more at homeCOMMA   but on the whole have gotten along very nicely.  For the   last ten days we have been enjoying a visit from Beckie and   MargaretCOMMA they think they must go back in a few days.    Mother just now is pretty wellCOMMA but she has suffered this   winter a great deal from rheumatismCOMMA is not quite free from   it yet; it has been a hard winter for that.  We had had acold springCOMMA to-day is warmerCOMMA and should not wonder if we   jumped right into SummerCOMMA but hope not as Mother feels the   heat very muchCOMMA and although we would like to go to Pocono   in MayCOMMA we do not want to go till DickCOMMA Mitchell's sonCOMMA who   boards with usCOMMA is thrugh collegeCOMMA which will be early in   June.  Cousin Mary Smith is going to board with us all   SummerCOMMA which we are very glad of.  Charlie has been invited   to preach at Pocono June 23rd so hope we will be there   before thatCOMMA so to have a little visit from him; he was not   able to get up last Summer.  There was a woods fire up there   about two weeks agoCOMMA and a cottage quitenear us was burned.  We were so thankful that ours escapedCOMMA   for we would have been lost if it had gone.  Augusta Hazard   was in Philadelphia a few weeks agoCOMMA she asked if we had   heard from you lately.  I must apologize for the blots I   have just madeCOMMA as I have not time to re-write it.

We   have had a most exercising day in all senses of the wordCOMMA   but so wonderful is the effect of this mountain air that I   do not feel the least tired.  In the first place this   morning we set off in an open wagon for Haines’ fall a   pleasant ride of about 2 milesCOMMA but it was after we got   there the “tug of war” began –  We hada regular scrambleCOMMA part of the way was so rough that Tom &   Walter concluded to remain behind & before we got through   there was no one left but Harry Ellie & Madge & ICOMMA we went   down to the very foot of the lower fallsCOMMA & were well   repaid; it was a most beautiful spotCOMMA a succession of six   lovely little falls ending in cascades & rapidsCOMMA it was   altogether quite charmingCOMMA the prettiest place of the kind I   ever sawCOMMA & I don’t remember ever to have seen a photograph   of it –  We did not get home till after the dinner bell had   rungCOMMA so were obliged just to give a little smoothe to our   hairCOMMA & go in in our mountain dressesCOMMA but every thing is   very primitive hereCOMMA & nobody pretends to dress for dinner.

Thee need not feel the least concern for   I don’t think we are any of us a bitthe worseCOMMA & the most remarkable part is we are not tired.    The only thing that suffered was our hatsCOMMA but I guess they   will look pretty well when they dryCOMMA & we’ll have to retrim   them at Newport –  Thee must be sure & not forget my bonnet   so that if we should arrive 7th day night I may have   something to wear to meeting.

I should like to see   themCOMMA if you can bring them with you in the fall.<br><br>And   now I wish to ask a favor If you should go over to theElk Mt. region I wish you could get me a young Snow Bird –   they have speckled breasts – I am very anxious to secure the   first plumages of all our birds & have nearly all now except   those which breed in the mountains.<br><br>If you come   across any young Warblers (except Chest-sided & Black &   White) or any young Thrushes or Savanna Sparrows I should be   just as thankful to get one of them.<br><br>I don’t think it   is as bad to kill a young bird as an old one during the   breeding seasonShould you get one you could remove the entrailsCOMMA put in a   little cotton with some carbolic acid (or plaster) & send it   by mail it will carry all right. Don’t put yourself to   trouble however.<br><br>I saw Stew & he greatly regrets his   inability to accept your invitation as you have doubtless   heard from him by this time.

I wish my dearCOMMA that you would make your      letters a little longerCOMMA & if you do not you will see mine      gradually decreasing in lengthCOMMA till there is hardly any      letter at all.  Uncle James went off to Harrisburg on Monday      as did Uncle Clem George Emlen John Thayre (my cousins) and      Cousin George Biddle.  Uncle Clem never told a soul that he      was going and on Sunday night when John went to the      Baltimore depot to see Gerge Emlen and John Thayre off to      his surprise he saw Uncle Clem.He was going off without bidding us good-bye when perhaps we      may never see him again.  He always was very queer but this      beats every thing.  Is not the war news splendid?  I have      not been so glad since the battle of DrainsvilleCOMMA      particularly about Howell Cobb the old traitor.  There is      now not the slightest fear of our having Stonewall Jackson      in Philadelphia but I pity the poor citizens of Cincinnati.       Cousin Sam Cox was called to a churchthere (St. Paul’s) and he accepted.  He left town two weeks      from yesterday and when he arrived at Cincinnati he was not      allowed to enter the city but was sent to a boarding house      about two miles from the city.  There he is now with his      wife children and father.  Of their furniture they know      nothing and are not allowed to go to the city to see about      it.  Every morning at five o’clock all the bells in the town      ring and every man who is able to carry a gun assembles in      some perminent place and from thence they go out into the      country to wait for the enemy.  Even clergymen are forced to      fight & Cousin Sam is in almost hourly fear of being made to      serve.  I received a letter from Martha Henderson just now.They are at present in Wiesbaden and Martha says that if her      relations were with her she would never again wish to leave      thereCOMMA not even for America.  That I cannot understand for      no place can or will ever be the same to me as dear      Philadelphia.  But I am forgetting my determination to make      my letter short and although I am burning to go on I deny      myself for your good as I think a little correction will be      very beneficial to you so I will sign myself y<br>your ever      loving and for long letters begging friend<br>Anna,http://165.106.6.73:80/cdm/ref/collection/cope/id/819,819,872131717122002_hsc0106.cpd

I gave my assent to adopting the one last explored &   Our Petition was Drawn in conformity thereto–<br>For want of   a Better map of Common Reference I must make use of Reading   Howells map of Pennsylvania to carry to thee an Idea of the   Route though from the incorrectness of it our Road will   appear more crooked than it will be eventualy found–<br>Our   Road begins at One Matts Tavern on the Coskectune and Great   Bend Turnpike Towards the Head of Salt [Lick] Creek – where   the Road from Tyoga Point crosses the said Turnpike –    Thence across the Milford & Owego Turnpike – & thence   between Martins Creek & the North Branch of the Tunkhannock   Creek–Thence across the South Branch of the same – & Thence   through Leggets Notch (or Gap) in the Lackawannock Range of   mountains [Formed by Leggets creek a small stream pretty   into the Lackawannock about 15 miles from the Susquehannah   according to Reading Howells map & scale] then across the   East & West Road at one Swartz Tavern – & then across   Roaring Brook or Deep Hollow Creek – Thence nearly Parralel   with the Same to the main Branch of the Lehigh River–    Thence S. 10 E across Tobyhanna Creek & its Branches to the   Sullivans Road & thence by the East End of the Large Pond to   the Turnpike Road on the top of the Pokono mountain at or   near the 30 mile stone from Wilkesbarre–  The whole Distance   Being from Point to point as Explored & measured about Fifty   Three miles – & the Estimated Expence $1000 per mile–  Our   Petition asks the Legislature to incorporate a company with   a capital of $75COMMA000 – but entre nous this is but a [Ruse de   Guerre]–<br>I do not pretend (from my imperfect knowledge of   the precise situation of thy lands upon the Meshoppen) to be   able to say How far thy interest may be advanced by the   completion of this Road But that it will be more or less   appears evident and plain –  That the Whole of Susquehanna   County – a Part of Luzerne Co. & a part of Pike will feel   its Blessings is not to be denied–  Neither I think will it   be doubted that the Road is interesting to parts of   Northampton – Bucks & Montgomery counties & as will be shown   Peculiarly Interesting to the City & county of   Philadelphia–<br>We have called it The Philadelphia & Great   Bend Turnpike & with good reason.- it forming the most   Important Link in the chain of communication & the only one   wanting to secure to Philadelphia incalculable advantages–    From the Pokono a good Turnpike Road now Exists (not Log   Turnpike) to the Wind Gap & from thence [are] two good   county Roads to Easton – on to Bethlehem by the way of   Nazareth – or to Janets Bridge in Lower Saucon where a   Turnpike Road is laid out – then by good Roads to either the   Willow Grove or Germantown Turnpikes  to the City of   Philada–.  We might Have called our Turnpike The   Counteracting Turnpike – it being the Only one Ever   projectedcalculated (By Intersecting the Turnpikes Leading to the   City of New York in important points) to counteract the   Influence that City by Her Liberallity Her Geographical   Wisdom and foresight in despight of natural obstructions –   Has obtained–<br>There is One advantage which will result to   Philada from this Road which (amongst many others) I select   Because it will reach the comprehension of Every man & is   capable of undeniable proof & is indeed Known to very many   persons in Bussiness in Philadelphia–  I speak now of the   Cattle Trade or the Driving of Horned Cattle Sheep & Horses   to the Philadelphia market–  I shall speak of such Facts as   are Known to me – some of which are Known to our Dry good   merchants – some to our Graziers and all to the Drovers   themselves–<br>The persons Engaged in this Trade are nearly   to a man Store Keepers from the state of New York–  They   receive cattle sheep & Horses in payment for various   merchandize sold by them to farmers in their vicinity.  Or   purchase them with the monies they Receive for their goods–    Their Best market for these cattle is found at Philadelphia   & notwithstanding the circuitous Route they are obliged to   take & the most miserable & wretched Roads which alone Exist   to this market they Drive Annualy cattle sheep & Horses to   the amount of One million of Dollars– (I [think] this season   of Horned cattle alone that near if not quite 1/2 a million   of Dollars in value Has passed By this place & through the N   & South Road  at least I am persuaded that I may rely on the   account I have Received of the number) – if then it be a   fact that near one million of Dollars in cattle sheep &   Horses reaches Philadelphia Every year from the State of New   York and that for want of a Road from Philada- to the   Western part of that state – the whole Sum is Drawn in cash   from Philada and goes to the City of New York & there is   Expended in the purchase of Merchandize Because of good   waggon Roads Connecting that City with the Said western part   of the State – will it not be apparent thatOur Road in Truth is a Philadelphia Turnpike & well Worthy   the Patronage & Support of every liberal minded Citizen–    But that this is the fact Every Drover will admit & I   beleive that they will very generaly declare that they would   much rather purchase their merchandize in Philadelphia than   in New York if it were possible to waggon [their] goods   through Pennsylvania to their Homes–  at least this is the   Sentiment expressed to me as far as I have conversed with   them – in addition Then to these facts – I may state That   Though Cattle forms perhaps a principal Remittance from   Store Keepers in the Western pt of N York–  Yet it is not   the only One – a good deal of Cash also is brought Down by   these persons & this cash also goes to the City of New York   which would if our Road was made Remain in Philada–<br>I may   State too without fear of contradiction that this Cattle   Trade in despight of Obstacles Has constantly & rapidly   increased that in spight of them it will increase & that if   nothing is done to Counteract the Evil we shall still   continue to pay to the City of New York for the Beef we Eat   – or in other words that the Philadelphia merchant. shall   continue to pay the New York merchant for the whole amount   of cattle Driven from this quarter to Philadelphia–  an   Enormous Annual Ballance Indeed for this one article of our   Consumption – again – This Highly Interesting Section of the   State of New York – [is] Hourly increasing in Wealth &   Importance – in wants of Foreign articles & Resources of   Domestic Wealth – And let me ask where can the merchants of   Philadelphia Find a Body of such customers as exist Here –   where Such a certain& constant Trade–  Where such an increase of Trade where   such certain remittances–  Presenting also at Least one   Million of Dollars per annum Being Drawn out of the City at   this Time & How much Hereafter it is not possible to   predict–  This However may Be reasonably [assumed] as a fact   – that if such now is the amount of this Trade with all the   difficulties which want of Roads present – a good Road will   very materially increase it – in [----] to Enumerate the   advantages to be reaped by Establishing a Free communication   with this Most Fertile Section of New York would more   properly form a Volume than suit the limits of a Letter– Yet   I may add that This Cattle Trade – though in itself of no   mean Importance to Philadelphia is only One amongst many   Valuable Blessings which New York has taken from   Philadelphia By the Superior Foresight of Her Citizens –   There it Has been Esteemed Honorable & not unworthy the   attention of Her first merchants to Examine in to The   Internal Resources of Her State as well as of Her Sister   States – whilst the [reins] of Philadelphians Seems to Have   Been almost altogether Turned Towards the Sea – to Maritime   ports & Latterly to the Great Western Waters–  Yet what   assisted to raise Philadelphia to Her present prosperity &   Rank more than all other Things was the Internal resources   of Her own State & those Sections of other States within   marketable Reach – and it is only as these Blessings   multiply & Have facilities given them to Extend to & Support   Her that She can on any Just grounds expect to advance – If   this possition is True & if I Have notfailed in making good my ground of the Vast advantage of communication with a Section of the State of New York to Philadelphia is not our Road in Truth a Philadelphia Road & entitled to the Best wishes & aid of that City–   in the Magnitude of the Advantages to Be reaped from the State of New York through the Medium of this Road ??? I must not loose sight of the Trade of our own Counties which also at present for want of Roads lead[ing] to Philadelphia likewise goes to the City of New York ??? The amt of this I Have not the present means of ascertain[ing] But it must be considerable & is rapidly increasing??? The Coskectune and Great Bend Turnpike & the Milford & Owego Turnpike are striking at the Best Interests of Philadelphia??? New York City is By these Roads Establishing to Herself a Course of Trade which Though Now Easily Diverted from Her to Philadelphia is growing every day more & more difficult ??? a Timely Exertion an application of one mite of the Vast money Resources of Philada at this time in aid of this apparently insignificant Road will do more than the Expenditure of much Greater sums on Seemingly much Greater undertakings   Our Road will cut the Milford & Owego Road & the Coskectune & Great Bend Turnpike in so delicate a part that the whole Eastern Section of Each will be benumned & rendered lifeless ??? Their object (the secur[ing] the Trade to the City of New York)will be effectualy Counteracted & Defeated – & The Proverb   Be good to Philada – “One man Sows & another reaps the fruit   of His Labour”–<br>I have gone into a length of detail &   [-----] reasoning that I had not contemplated & I fear Have   tired Thee as well as myself.–  I crave forgiveness for my   fault–  I nevertheless would be much pleased if Thee Should   Think a Publication of Any of these Views – Couched in   different Language and Respectfuly dressed would in any way   be of advantage to us in gett[ing] through with our   important Road – for though I have made it appear that there   is abundant Riches to the West & North West of us & more   wealth than foresight in Philadelphia  Yet the fact must be   told that We are miserably poor – & that unless the City   aids our Road it may Be as long as Troys Seige before it is   Travelld–<br>Now if Thee would undertake the Herculean Task   of Picking the marrow (if there be any to be found) out of   this Long [map] of writing – Dress it & Suit it to the   palate of our Philadelphians & Serve it up to them in a News   paper I should Hope that it might in time of need possibly   aid us in Subscriptions to our Turnpike Stock –  This   However I leave to thy Better Judgement–<br>My Best Respects   to Aunt Grandmother & my cousins Generaly remain[ing] as   Ever affectionaly<br>thy Nephew HWDrinkerStoddartsVille<br>Novembr. 21st<br>Paid 25<br>Thomas P.

Uncle Tom sent me word that he   had expressed a sample of color which Craig has prepared for   our inspection.  I suppose we may get the package tomorrow –   but what troubles me is the delay – Craig said he would have   it all done so we could come back the 20th.

That I have been such a long   while without writing to thee. Indeed I have notCOMMA & never   shall I hope- but my wonderings [early] terminated last 7th   day & since then I have had a very bad coldCOMMA which thee   knows makes one lazy. - I have wanted to know how thee   faired after our parting on the hill. My walk was brisk & I   did not keep Maggie’s [---] waiting longCOMMA and did not feel   tired. I fear thee did not fare so well. Our visit to our   Wilmington friends was very pleasant.<br>RichieCOMMA thee knowsCOMMA joined me in that. Tho he was not well   enough to enjoy it thoroughly. Lizzie seems very happy & we   hope is learning somethingCOMMA - at least she gets very good   numbers. - The roads were so bad it was not easy to get   about & my journey to Faulkland was a [arduous] one. but the   pleasure of cheering cousin Mary a little & hearing Dr   [Fell]  talkCOMMA- a great deal more than repaid me for it.-   <br><br>When I returned to Phila John & Sallie Hilles & I   went over to see Charles Rhoads. It was very touching to see   those five little motherless children. Charles looks tens   years older and much broken down.- His sister was very   pleasant- I never knew her before. They are certainly much   favored in having such kind caretakers & hardly feel their   loss as they will after awhile. - I often think of   what<br><br>thee said to me in the car after our visit to Clemmy. dear   AnnieCOMMA with loving sympathy. Deserving too that I may fully   appreciate the blessing of a mothers love while mine is   still spared to me. - I hear Clemmy is goingCOMMA or has gone to   BaltimoreCOMMA to teach the Freedmen. What do you think of it?   It seems to me that anything that would give interesting   employment to both mind and bodyCOMMA would be good for her. Tho   I’m right sorry to have her go so far away. - Thee will miss   her too. - Do write some & tell me all about her plans. -   Lilly Collins seems to like her situation very well. I found   a letter from her awaiting me on my return.- She gives an   amusing account of a colored meeting which she attendedCOMMA - a   real happy [----------] affair.- Lilly enjoys the variety I   should think & it keeps her from being homesick.- Cousin   Elizalooked & seemed more cheerful when I called - but she   certainly is very weak.-<br><br>I suppose the preparations   for the wedding are proceeding briskly- Does the go? I quite   want to hear about it. - Lizzie Brown’s sister is to be   married tomorrow & I hope the threatened storm will not come   to spoil all their nice dresses.- Lizzie’s friend Edward   Balderson stayed with us last night. He is to wait on a   young lady from Jersey -  so I fear the love affair between   him & Lizzie is all over - but time will make manifest. Has   thee seen anything more of the interesting students- Till   thy brother Thomas his opinion of the [-----] position of   Carpenters is very family impressed upon my mind.- It makes   me smile now to think how frightened I wasCOMMA I deserved   rebuke too.- Do please write to me soon dear Annie.- My love   please to thy father & sister E & with a large share of the   same for thyself I am thy sincerely attached & grateful   friend<br> <br>S.

'42 <br><br>Dear Sister Rachel<br><br>We had so uneventful a journeyCOMMA I have been so quiet since our arrival hereCOMMA that I have scarcely material for a letter. Travellers are expectedCOMMA I believeCOMMA to be particularly entertaining. NowCOMMA there is no time when I feel less so. FatigueCOMMA change of air & dietCOMMA always for a timeCOMMA affect my health unfavorably; and thenCOMMA the turmoil & bustle scatter the little wits I possess. So thatCOMMA from homeCOMMA I am an especially stupid correspondent. StillCOMMA as you were kind enough to wish to hear from usCOMMA and as we exchanged promises about writingCOMMA I will not wait for any thing worth sayingCOMMA --as I may not have it at allCOMMA thee knows; -- and my delay may occasion me the disappointment of not receiving hereCOMMA the speedy return letter from Fourth StCOMMA which is to be my reward.-- <br><br>We had quite a pleasant time so far as TrentonCOMMA for our first day's exploit. We arrived there about half past five o'clock; and George with our baggageCOMMA via. steam-boat and rail-roadCOMMA very shortly after. In the eveningCOMMA we made a little visit to Elizabeth GummereCOMMA who lives near the Hotel. They have a fineCOMMA large houseCOMMA in a pleasant part of townCOMMA & express themselvesCOMMA the young folksCOMMA most emphaticallyCOMMA pleased with their change of residence. As we were in the immediate neighborhoodCOMMA we went with Eliza..thCOMMA to spend a few minutes with our old friendCOMMA Judge Gordon's wife. She looks and seems just the same asI recollect her in the days of my childhood. So it appears that in this bustling lifeCOMMA there are some not easily jostled out of their way. We found the JudgeCOMMA some years agoCOMMA busy with his attempts to sell his map of New Jersey. It still seems a most interesting theme to him; & if we come this way six years henceCOMMA I dare say he will even then be ready to speak of its merits & to state that his stock is not yet exhausted.-- Fifth day night brought us within twelve miles of the mountainCOMMA and the next day at noonCOMMA we reached the end of our journey--and over such roads! I was thinkingCOMMA perpetuallyCOMMA of the children's song ""Here we go upCOMMA upCOMMA upCOMMA & here we go downCOMMA down"" &c &c. To adopt little Cary's favourite styleCOMMA the rain had washed such gulleys in the roadsCOMMA & the stones were so bareCOMMA & there were so many of them!-- <br>The first two days after we got hereCOMMA we had three or four showers per day. By way of consolationCOMMA we were toldCOMMA this was a favorable specimen of their weather this season. For the previous ten daysCOMMA it had rained all the time. ""Recorder [Vaux?]"" who is hereCOMMA calls it temperance weather. I wonder if [Espy] is a tee-totaller.--We were beguiled COMMA when we first cameCOMMA into taking a room in ""the cottage"" Its superior dimensionsCOMMA privacy &c were warmly insisted upon. And as we like plenty of roomCOMMA and don't like much noiseCOMMA we thought it quite a prize. The sun shone so flatteringly upon the [compact?]COMMA that we never thought of the inconvenience of being drenched in going to our mealsCOMMA or having them drenched  in being brought to us. As we have now had ample opportunity of trying it both waysCOMMA and don't relisheitherCOMMA we begin to murmer. Coming in search of HealthCOMMA we fancy tooCOMMA that a sleeping apartment on the ground floor is not exactly the place to meet with her ladyshipCOMMA this damp summer. We have some of the inconvenient ""[Fine-ear]"" familyCOMMA moreoverCOMMA next usCOMMA who have been very near getting us into a scrape. A grand-daughter of John Jacob Astor has been stoping with a Mr KaneCOMMA from AlbanyCOMMA andCOMMA under what her friends considerCOMMA very aggravated circumstances. They came here to spend the Honey moonCOMMA & unfortunatelyCOMMA were placed in the room adjoining ours.

They were purchase by himCOMMA by Uncle John Tomas of the State of Penna. The Legislatures Land office being about that time / 1772 in Philadelphia. The Legislature at that early period - had made a rule that the public lands should be sold in tracts not exceeding 480 acres each- and that no individual should be permitted to purchase more- but finding this plan did not answer- they concluded to allow purchaser to buy more largely. On condition that they would find a number of nominal purchasers of 400 acre tracts- each receiving a deed poll for every tract- and then transferring them to the purchaser. Accordingly Father and Uncle John found a number of their friends & acquaintances to do this - and in this way bought of the state about 2500 acres of land under different Warranter homes. Uncle J Thomas becoming embarrassed and owing a debt to the firm of Adams and Loughey - his interest was free wh to sale- and bought by my father - who became sole owner of these lands. this transaction- is mentioned in the [land] deed now in my possession- which I am persuaded gives a clear title to the land. The deed polls for these traitswere in Brother Henry's possession but were consumed with other important papers by the bank fire. --- The record of these deed polls must have been in the Land office in Philadelphia - and taken to Harrisburg when the office & Legislature removed there. <br><br>10th [may]<br> Dear Cousin--- I rec'd thy letter of the 8th ins yesterday & I am very sorry thee has had so much trouble on my account. We had hoped our statements would have satisfied thee as to the clearness of the title to the lands. It is thought by some that if I had gone to the city - a personal interview with thee might have resulted differently- but I could not see that this was a right course-- I should be glad to sell our lands as thee suggests and it seems probable we may; but dear cousinCOMMA I fear we could not do in it time to save ourselves-- but I believe if I could sell my own land which is clear of all encumbrances - it might be a benefit to me as well as others- By offering to sell and pay part of the purchase money to be applied in reducing the mortgage on Henry's property- Wm L Gildersleac might be induced to free me from the lien he holds on my own. though a money makings he is said to be a religious man- and a friend to the poor- and if in addition to dealing his ""bread to the hungry"" he will also ""let the oppressed go free"" by releasing me ""from this bond"" he may be a gainer in the best sense without losing any of his earthly gains -- By selling some & gettingthe rest of my property clear it would reliever me from much embarrassment & trouble- there is not mortgage on them the taxes all paid by brother Richard with his [mon] - except for this year I believe and I can pay them with a small sum reserved in [Levanton] for such purchases- the lands are well timbered and in a good locationCOMMA where they can easily be seen after. Those I propose to sell (as most advantageous to a purchaser are in a black - except one a valuable timbered lot No 81 - which is not far from the railroad it corners on No 82* containing 200 acres a lot for which I am offered $1218 = but I would rather be intently clear of any interference before I make a sale- The lands I want to sell are all mentioned and described in the large Deed I have in my possession which was drawn up by brother John who was considered a very good [--------] as well as a Lawyer. The lots are No 30.. Nos 42 52 53 54 & part of No 41 in all with lot No81 about 650 acres--- no 42 contains about 82 acres 26 of this lot being sold and a small clearing made- I suppose there is a drawing of there lots in the [m---] drawn by my nephew Charles which will show how they are situated. My cousins Cope Brothers in their last letter to me asked at what price it would be desirable to sell my property. Expecting to sell the whole property. I had to consult others about the price- but in regard to the lots I have mentioned I will say just what my friends may think it right to give- If I can by selling there lands pay W Gildersleac what he may require and leave enough to settle some debts and pay the arrears of taxes on some lands now in the hands of the [common coiners] in Wilkes Barres. I shall be glad to do so. the sale of our lumber will then I think carry as through<br><br>*this lot was under construct - previous to the lien on my other property. Which makes some doubt as to whether W L Gildersleac would claim it.and if in time- we can succeed in paying off the mortgage or sell our lands. I can then be repaid for the money. I may advance now to help others as well as myself. If times become more favorable - I have hopes with prudence & care- we may yet be extricated from our difficulties & be enabled to pay all our own liabilities. I am much in need of good council- I have suggested the sale of part of my lands as a means of relief but I am not certain even if I could effort it- that I could obtain a release from Wm. L Gildersleac-- <br> <br> do as thee thinks but dear cousin- in regard to returning the papers- but if thee can help me in any way by advice it will be a great favor to thy<br> affectionate cousin<br>Rebecca Drinker",http://165.106.6.73:80/cdm/ref/collection/cope/id/857,857,747251717122002_hsc0132.cpd

We accordingly determined to cross the mountain to McConnell [-] if it were possible to procure a chair.  Our landlord discouraged us so much from attempting it in that manner that we determined to try it on horse back.  What dost thou think of Henry's riding in the saddle to the distance of 21 miles & returning the next day over one of the highest mountains in N. America.  It was his own determination for I really was afraid to encourage it.  The experiment however succeeded to admiration & we are here again without hurt or damage.  We had a noble prospect from the top of the mountain.  We both kept journals which will serve to give you some account of our proceedings.

Although as respects the article of pleasure I am entirely satisfiedCOMMA yet I have concluded it would be prudent for me to remain a few daysCOMMA perhaps a weekCOMMA longer.    The party I came down withCOMMA all return tomorrow; should I return with themCOMMA I shall have been here but six days & have bathed but five times.  This can hardly be called giving the water a fair trial.  Thus far I do not know that I have received any benefit; some of our boarders tell me they think I walk betterCOMMA but I am myself sensible of no change.  We board much farther from the surf than is agreeable to meCOMMA but it was impossible to procure quarters in the home nearest the shore.  On the whole I do not much regret itCOMMA as our accommodations are much better than can be had in the other houses.<br>The party we attached ourselves toCOMMA engaged a large room with a bed for each and a stipulation that while we occupied it no others should be admitted.  This party consists of Merritt CanbyCOMMA Jos. AskersCOMMA Ellis YarnallCOMMA Robert BarnesCOMMA (a brother to the doctor) Richard Nixon a young englishmanCOMMA and a very clever fellow & our two selves.  When they are gone we shall shift our quarters into a small apartment.  With respect to the employment of our timeCOMMA it is sufficiently monotonousCOMMA and I fear next week will be still duller.  This however applies to myself.  Those who are well find employment enough in gunningCOMMA fishingCOMMA walking &c.  I was one of a fishing party to-dayCOMMA which as it will form  one of the most memorable events of my excursionCOMMA deserves to be noted.  The packet boatCOMMA General Jackson has a day to spare here on each tripCOMMA & to-day she engaged to take as many as chose to goCOMMA out to the banks to catch sea-bass.  A more delightful day for the excursion could hardly be conceived.  It was neither too hotCOMMA too coldCOMMA too windyCOMMA nor too calm.  We were unfortunate in but one particularCOMMA and that a main one.  We found no fish.  I was among the most fortunate and caught three.  One whole stock amounted to about four dozen.  At our greatest distance we were nearly out of sight of land; our fishing place was near twenty miles from shore.  William was afraid to go for fear of sea sickness.  As all the rest of our party wentCOMMA and I was fearful he would be sick myselfCOMMA I did not urge him.  I begin to feel quite sailor likeCOMMA as respects this said sickness.  I never felt better in my life.  A few of the party were very sickand several others complained.  Jos. [---] was the most severely handled of any person on board; he was really ill.  The most unpleasant part of our expedition was landing through the surf on our return.  We landed in a whale-boatCOMMA which was brought down pretty low in the waterCOMMA by the weight of her cargoCOMMA consisting of twenty-three persons.  We rose safely over the surf till our prow touched the beachCOMMA when it broke over the sternCOMMA rocked us very much & shocked several.  Jos. {----] had his hat knocked off & was amazingly frightened.  McAlpinCOMMA the [-------]COMMA in riding to shore on the shoulders of one of the boatmenCOMMA upsetCOMMA horse & rider.  We were unpolite enough to laugh a good dealCOMMA but he bore it with the greatest good nature.<br>We shall certainly not exceed our two weeks here.

Uncle Tom expects to go home to Philadelphia nextMonday or Tuesday & uncle Edgar & myself will probably remain two or three days later.

I am very much discusted at the delay about ordering the wagon.  I can not see but what the two-wheeler is not as safe as a four-wheeler.  At any rate the two-wheeled cart is much the lightest and easier to turn if you should happen to get into a tight place; but the main advantage is that they are lighterCOMMA & as we have nostrong horse suitable for the girls to driveCOMMA I should think that we had better get the two-wheeler.  If you have desided pretty much not to get the cartCOMMA I think you might as well get a light buggie something like thine.  Thee will have to deside now or never if we are going to get it this summer.<br>The hotel where we are staying now is a very fashionable placeCOMMA & there is not much fishing or anything else to do.  Yesterday we took a lovely steamboat ride along the Canadian shore & among the islands.  It was verypretty indeed as all the islands on the Canada side belong to the government & are very wild for nobody is aloud to build on them.  Now we have seen the islands there is not much to doCOMMA so we intend to leave here tomorrow morning & take the boat to Kingston and from there to Cimcoe Island where the fishing is said to be very fine.<br>I got a very nice letter last Friday evening from Grandma saying that  Grandpa was going on toNewportCOMMA as uncle Thomas was coming home from Berkshire.  Uncle Tom thinks of taking the boat from Cimcoe Island to Toronto and then coming home by Niagara.  But he has not desided certainly about it yetCOMMA partly owing to the strike at Buffalo.  If he does that I shall return with him as I may not get another chance for some time.  If uncle Edgar likes the fishing at Cimcoe he will probably stay a few days later.  So thee sees there is nothing certainly desided about coming home.  Uncle E thinks he may stop atTunkhannock on his way to Overbrook and try the fishing in the Susequehanna.  I will return any how by the 1st Sept.COMMA and will try and let thee know the day beforeCOMMA when we are coming.<br>Tell Ellie I will try & right to her soon.<br>Affec'ly thy son<br>Francis R. Cope Jr.<br>Uncle Tom thinks we had better get the cart and try itCOMMA and that there need be no danger if we drive carefully.<br>Uncle Tom sends is love to thee.,http://165.106.6.73:80/cdm/ref/collection/cope/id/945,945,comp_obj_A1270011048520564686.XML.cpd

The latter done no credit either to thy heart or judgement.  Thy Father condemned it in to-toCOMMA as the sauciest little girls Letter he thought he had ever seen; & thou knowest he is not very rigid; or as some would sayCOMMA not at all particular or precise; so when he is offended thou mayest conclude thy improprieties must be very striking indeed.  My Daughter should ever recollect that when she asks a favorCOMMA it should not be in the high tone of a demand: it should not be claimed as a RightCOMMA which if not immediately complied with is to be forthwith resented as an injury; but when she wishes for attentionsCOMMA her wishes should be modestly insinuatedCOMMA not as tho' she believed them due to her meritCOMMA on account of her great worth & services for which she expected extraordinary returns; but as tho her Affection prompted her to desire themCOMMA at the same time that she was conscious she could do & had done but littleCOMMA for her friends; while their time & thoughtCOMMA & industry was often exerted in providing for her WantsCOMMA & promoting her Welfare.  This would lead her to be content with such portions as they could conveniently bestowCOMMA & grateful when she recieved them: she would dwell upon every instance of their kindness & cherish the remembrance of itCOMMA as an evidence of love for which she had neverCOMMA as yetCOMMA had the power to render an equivalentCOMMA & she would hasten to qualify herself to become useful to themCOMMA in her turnCOMMA especially to her MotherCOMMA whoCOMMA if she livesCOMMA must shortly be overtaken by Age & its attendant infirmities.  Then the kind officesCOMMA the endearments & domestic services of a dutiful affectionate DaughterCOMMA are an invaluable treasure.  These considerationsCOMMA when once embracedCOMMA cannot fail to sink deep in the heart of sensibility"" & willCOMMA if cherishedCOMMA bring forth those substantial [-------] of Virtue in my beloved daughterCOMMA which my heartincessantly longs for.  After all my dear EllenCOMMA I still flatter myselfCOMMA that in regard to the said saucy letter the fault lays more in the manner & languageCOMMA than the heart that dictated it:  I am by no means displeased that thou should'st prize our love & cover the marks of it; & am in hopes that the fearCOMMA the dreadCOMMA & horror of being hated (so earnestly express'd & often repeated) will operate to induce thee to be best calculated to win back affectionCOMMA even if it has fled.  But on this subject I need not enlarge.  Thou knowest well what my desires for thee are.  Thou hast only to look back & reflect on my frequent labors of loveCOMMA & painful anxieties on thy account (lest thou should not be what my heart cravesCOMMA) and it will be enough: - yet there is one still remains untouch'dCOMMA on which I feel in duty bound to refresh thy memory.  I mean the observance of respect to thy Teachers & superintendants; absolute & complete perfection is seldom found among Mortals; as least it takes (in most of us) nearly a whole Life to attain it: do not therefore indulge a disposition in thyselfCOMMA neither take part with any who do soCOMMA to make exceptions or look out for faults in those who have so great a weight of Care & responsibility upon them; but rather turn thy attention to thy own deficiencies & need of improvement.  If their patience & sweetness is not uniformCOMMA recollect that thy ownCOMMA if in their situationCOMMA would probably come far short of what is expected COMMA remember that it is for the sake of orderCOMMA & for thy ownCOMMA or the general good.  By forgetfulness or ignorance of these truthsCOMMA Children often display the weakness of their understandingsCOMMA their excess of selfish feelingCOMMA & total want of feeling for others.  It is never too early to begin to do goodCOMMA & few little girlsCOMMA who were resolved to make a firm stand against these errors: but it must begin at oneCOMMA & how proud should I beCOMMA would but my Ellen resolve to be that one what a happiness would it be to know that she had been the instrument of giving a new tone of feeling & action to the whole of the little community of which she is a Member - a tone so correct & beautiful tooCOMMA as to excite general approbation!on the contraryCOMMA what a pain to find her banded with a company not only so childishCOMMA but so vulgarCOMMA so void of all true taste ; so void of all gentilityCOMMA refinement & delicacy - so completely lowCOMMA as to speak of ""throwing old shoes &c"" - Indeed I am almost ashamed to write itCOMMA or think of it.  Those who desire respect or attention for themselves - who expect ever to be esteemed as gentlewomenCOMMA should have more regard to propriety & true dignity of character.<br><br>Thy copy of Verses is very prettyCOMMA & if they express thy own thoughts & feelingsCOMMA very acceptable ; except the last stanzaCOMMA which represents a forlorn destitute stateCOMMA not at all applicable to thy situation.  As to thy request about a jingling LetterCOMMA I must inform thee that such music is not always at my finger ends - & for thyself I would much rather thou would'st improve in good prose-writing COMMA before any attempt at poetry is made - unless indeed it should come of itself without such ""hard striving"".<br>It was singular I think that thou should'st dream of thy Grandmother Cope never having seen her - but I have no doubt the inscription on whiteCOMMA which thou could'st not read is indeed of thy admirable Brother.  For him was exemplified all that gentleness & delicacy of characterCOMMA which I so warmly recommend to my Ellen.  In whatever School or family he was placed his behaviourCOMMA & his memory nowCOMMA that he has left the World & all usCOMMA [--] less pure inhabitants to mingle in the Society of angelic Spirits; & his watery Urn has been plentifully bedew'd with those tears of sadness which mingledCOMMA as it were with the waves that overwhelmed him; nowCOMMA henceforth & foreverCOMMA will the remembrance of him be precious; yeaCOMMA sweeter than a garden of Roses after the Summer.<br><br>I expect thy Grandmother D-r every minute from Burlington-- Thy various messages have mostly been deliveredCOMMA & all desire their love in return - (Mariam in particular) - thy  Brother Henry cannot recollect about M.G.'s Letter: but if he had the charge of it I dare answer for his punctuality.  If he does not often send his love in formCOMMA he loves thee none the less.  I believe he has hope of theeCOMMA for he sometimes comforts me by saying he thinks thy faults are much like his own were at thy age; onlyCOMMA his were in thoughtCOMMA for he was affraid to shew them because he knew they were not allowed: indeed he did not dare to let them be seenCOMMA lest he should give offence: for he loved his parents tenderlyCOMMA & could not bear to give them pain; & I have heard him say when a BoyCOMMA on seeing others misbehave - get into disgrace - & excite disgustCOMMA - I am glad my parents never suffered me to get into such habits.  Now there is this difference between youCOMMA supposing you both to have been under the same temptations to evil in your childhood - that all thy virtue will be voluntaryCOMMA & therefore more meritorious - that isCOMMA it will originate in a love of goodnessCOMMA & desire to attain itCOMMA in thy own breastCOMMA & for its own sake - whereas he was assisted in his endeavours by the Authority of his parentsCOMMA & the divine blessing superadded to both; and thou hast beenleft more to thyself: at least in thy educationCOMMA persuasion has been used more than compulsion.  Let me entreat thee therefore my DaughterCOMMA not to dissapoint thy Father; when belief has been so sanguine that his Daughters could be won to Virtue thro' the medium of the UnderstandingCOMMA by the force of Reason & good counsel; yet tho I entreat theeCOMMA I know - & I am in duty bound to tell thee so - I knowCOMMA that without earnest & frequent intercessionCOMMA with thy SaviourCOMMA in true humility of heartCOMMA accompanied by love of his divine perfectionsCOMMA & fear of offending him - in shortCOMMA without his aid & blessingCOMMA thou can'st do nothing:  As he said himself - ""Without me of yourselvesCOMMA ye can do nothing"": - SoCOMMA tho' it is possible to conform to outward rules of good behaviourCOMMA at timesCOMMA & for a timeCOMMA (which is better than being always bad) yet to become establish'd to be immovable in virtuous intentionCOMMA to be steadfast in resisting every temptation to evilCOMMA is impossible without him:  for this cause is he stiled a SaviourCOMMA a Redeemer from the bondage of Sin; and we are assured by a revelation from God ""that there is no name given under Heaven or amongst menCOMMA whereby they can be savedCOMMA but by the name of Jesus"" - How great then is his goodness & how much do we owe him who tho' he needs nothing from usCOMMA has given his Life for us in the body of flesh be assumed; & ever standsCOMMA as it were knocking at our hearts by his gentle checks & intimations wooing us to good - meeting & strengthening our feeble desires after it - & all for the sake of our eternal happiness!<br><br>Well my dearsCOMMA thou wilt perhaps thinkCOMMA if I have not written thee many LettersCOMMA I am making up for it in the length of this: and not to tire thee quite out I will now conclude<br>Thy truly loving mother<br>Mary Cope<br>P.S. Mother is not come; but we hear is coming the last of next Week.  Thy Capes are doneCOMMA I was pleased with thy proposition to make them thyselfCOMMA as a mark of industry; but would rather thee would make the shirt to learn to darn neatly.

Miss Field gets a great many & I   began to feel as if it was quite time for me to be having my   turn too.  You must remember that I never was befor so   entirely among strangers. & that your letters now will be my   best substitutes for homeCOMMA as I shall depend on them greatly   I tried to write yesterday but did not make out much.  It   was my first 1st day in Baltimore.  Do you remember last 1st   dayCOMMA when [were] were walking on the piazza & wondering   whether I shd. be here?  I did not much think I shd. then   but it seems I am.  Went to meeting yesterday morn. wh. I   quite enjoyed.  The only faces that I had ever seen before   were Deborah ThomasCOMMA Margy Coale & Tammie Miller.  I was   introduced to lots of others who were all very kindCOMMA & said   they were coming to see me.  There was a frd. named Elicott   & her two sisters who I think said they knew Mother.  We had   a sermon [fmr.] Deba  ThomasCOMMA the DrCOMMA & one or two others.    After meeting in the aftnoon I set out to take a walk & was   joined by a young lady named Mary Elicott & & JesseCOMMA who   took me a beautiful walk out to whats called theReservoirCOMMA where there is a fountain and a splendid view of   green hills & also of the distant waters of the bayCOMMA as well   as of parts of the city.  & yet it was not a walk of more   than a mile I shd. think<br>Baltimore is certainly a   beautiful place & I never realized before so fully what an   advantage what an advantage a hilly city possesses over a   flat one.  It quite throws Philada into the shade as far as   beauty is concerned.  There is such a refreshing variety in   the style of the housesCOMMA & other [buildings] & the hills   show them off to great advantage.  Charles St. seems to be   one of the most aristocratic in wh. the monument is   situatedCOMMA a very beautiful column of white marbleCOMMA 170 ft   high wh. as it stands upon a hill serves as a land mark for   a long distance round.  as you ascend the street with the   monument towering high above you the stars & stripes   floating over it & the city as you catch glimpses of it at   certain points apparently beneath youCOMMA the effect is very   imposing.  I think Phila. wld. strike one as flat after   this.  It has its advantages tho’.<br>Jesse has not come to   take us any rides yet.  tho he has promised to.  They say he   is very attentive to a certain – young lady here so we shall   not be so likely to derive as much benefit.  [---]. He has   been very polite so far.  & the ladies of the house are   continually laying plans for our entertainment wh. is   exceedingly kind in them.  I really feel more at home here   than I wd with some relations!Miss Talbot who is the housekeeper is one of the easy   talkative kind & makes me think a little of Mary Sayne.    Only far Superior.  they are exceedingly informal & get up &   wait on table & clear the things away in what theeCOMMA NatCOMMA   wld. call a very shocking mannerCOMMA but they are perfect   ladies for all – hospitable & fond of societyCOMMA & they seem   to have a great many pleasant frds.  Their one girl is not   the most efficient cook in the world but I have such a good   appetite that I get along very wellCOMMA – I feel most as hungry   as when I get home frm. school as I remember I used to when   I was a scholar.  We have breakfast about 7 1/2 go to sch.   about 8 1/4.  it is only 10 min. walk — get home about 1.   pretty tired with the 4 hrs. standing & ready to lie down   till dinner time at 2 1/2.  After dinner we get dressed & go   out or see company.  We most always have one or two callers.   at 7 again we have tea & then get our work and sit in the   parlorCOMMA & wonder who is coming when the bell rings.  Miss   Field I like exceedingly.  She is a Presbyterian & a very   superior girl I shd. think so that in the matter of   companionship I need to have had fewer fears and   trepidations than I had<br>The school duties are not long   but pretty arduous while they last.  We have to stand nearly   all the time.  At least the model teachers doCOMMA but we   inferiors take the liberty of popping downoccasionallyCOMMA but it is at the risk of [good] order for   there are so many in the room that unless you stand up to   itCOMMA & keep your eye on all 30 or 40 at once they are very   apt to get wrong in the back seats.  One of the first points   is to get [them] disciplined.  Mr Waterman the principal –   drills his class just as you wld. soldiers makes them fold   their arms put out one foot & finally stand up just as a   general wld. his troopsCOMMA & when school is dismissed they   file out in quite an imposing manner.  That is to teach them   obedience I supposeCOMMA wh. is a great point gained.  They also   teach them a kind of gymnastic exercises by way of   recreation. as they have no place to play & consequently no   regular recess or almost none.  Mine is the next to the   smallest class. & only studys reading & spelling in words of   4 or 5 letters wh. is not very interesting.

Jesse sent me word to day that he was   going [on] himself to P & out to Mary Yarnalls & that he wd.   give you a call & bring or take anything I wanted so here is   a chance again for the silk skt. only I wld nt like to ask   him to bring itCOMMA as I think he only offered out of   politeness & will probably take nothing with him but a   valise & as mine is a plain silk & wd. not bear rumplingCOMMA I   guess it had better not be sent altho’ I told him I shd. be   obliged to him to bring a small package.  If thee Mother cd.   sendme thy old light silk skt. (wh. I believe thee offered) it   wld. do as well to wear with white bodiesCOMMA & cld be put in   smaller space.  But I really wd not like to ask Jesse to   bring itCOMMA for he is so polite that he wd. say it was   convenient whether it was or not.  If however you cd. manage   to get up a sack or shawl that wd. do for sch. (wh. subject   I mentioned in my last letter) I shd. be very glad to have   it.  Jesse returns on 5th dayCOMMA--so his call will be sometime   between this & thenCOMMA He proposed that I shd. go with him &   pay a short visitCOMMA wh. I declined of course.

She seemed   to be more interested in her husband than anything..

I thought maybe you would like to know something about my gettings along on my journeyCOMMA so I will begin at Pottstown up to which place you are informed of what transpired.  Well after taking the last look at youCOMMA I turned round & felt a little forlorn at finding nothing but my carpetbag to keep me companyCOMMA so as I had nobody to talk to (I was very glad I had'nt) I thought I would occupy myself with thinking about you & wondering how you were getting along.  Directly after we started we came whizzing past a train of carsCOMMA which I supposed were the ones wh. were to convey you back to Philada.  I was very glad to see them because I knew you would be & I was afraid you might have had to wait there a good whileCOMMA but it was'nt very pleasant to think that we were speeding away from each other as fast as we could go.  I hope you did'nt feel as [worn] & dusty when you got to Phila as I did when I reached Port Clinton I had'nt much time to think about it however for I had to go quite in traveller like style & superintend as well as I could amid the bustle & din the transportation of our baggage from one car to anotherCOMMA that seen toCOMMA I joined my companions & weput ourselves on board the cars for TamaquaCOMMA a ride of two hours brought us to that place about 1 o'clockCOMMA there we staid about half an hour most of wh. time I spent in trying to restore my face to a decent shade of colorCOMMA for I found it in the funniest looking condition thee can imagineCOMMA the dustCOMMA & the tears occasioned by the cindersCOMMA (& something else) had covered [skin] spots with a sort of black paste wh. very much resembled mud & wh. I had some difficulty in removing.  I thought it expedient to [see first] watering place to get out & wash so I performed my ablutions quite comfortably under the spout where the horses were drinkingCOMMA it reminded me of Aunt Fortunes style of face washing.  The ride over the mountains was just about as usualCOMMA except that it was a little bit hotter & dustier & disagreeabler than ever.  We had 9 passengers in the stage not counting carpetbags & blanket shawls wh are an important item in hot weather I hope I have left mine for the enjoyment of somebody who will take a cooler time for it.  We lived all the afternoon in the anticipation of a cooler ride after sunsetCOMMA but it seemed to grow hotter instead of colderCOMMA most of the passengers seemed to forget their discomforts in a nap so I was left to my own entertainment & sat very quietly in one corner thinking about different things among others I amused myself with imagining what you were about atCOMMA OaklandCOMMA & wishing I was there with you instead of where I wasCOMMA about 11 1/2 P.M. we were wheeled up before the Phoenix Hotel in Wilkesbarre where as soon as possible (tho' not until morning) we made our way to our sleeping apartments mine did not prove to be much of a sleeping apartment however tho' as much as could have been expected of a roomwithout windows & with featherbedsCOMMA they were very full at the Hotel & we were obliged to be content with the kind of accomodations we could get.  Thinking to better my condition I got up the next morning at half past three & found it a decided improvement upon lying in bed We left [W] about 7 o'clock & had a pleasant ride thro' the valley of WyomingCOMMA it is by far the pleasantest part of the journey I thinkCOMMA the country is looking beautifully nowCOMMA only it was too hot to enjoy it.  We reached Tunkhannock about 12 1/2 PMCOMMA & now comes the very dismalest part of allCOMMA at this place the two lades with whom I had travelled from Phila & whom I knew very well left me unexpectedlyCOMMA & I was packed without any ceremony into a kind of open arrangement upon wheels (for it hardly deserved the name of a wagon) & after considerable crowding & pushingCOMMA & groaning I managed to squeze in between two fat women & an indiscriminate collection of trunksCOMMA & handboxesCOMMA & men.  Under these auspicious circumstances we startedCOMMA the sun basking down upon us in one directionCOMMA & some ominous looking black clouds in anotherCOMMA so [hot] I scarcely knew whether to wish most for a drenching or a coo[k]ing I an addition to this the driver was entertaining us with all sorts of awful predictionsCOMMA he said the roads were terribleCOMMA that the bridge had been washed away & he expected we would all be drowned in crossing the creekCOMMA & as to his horses he was perfectly certain they never could stand itCOMMA & so I thought I shd never get home in the worldCOMMA that something awful certainly could'nt fail to happen among so many dismal predictionsCOMMA & they were such a queer set of peopleCOMMA & altogether I felt such an utter sense of forlornness that I eddified them by beginning to cry.  I was provoked at myself for being so foolish but I really could'nthelp itCOMMA it did'nt last very long howeverCOMMA for directly one man who seemed to quite pity me turned round & said in the most compassionate toneCOMMA ""you feel kind'er used up do'nt you.""  I was so struck with the applicability of the expression (for in truth I did feel a sort of sense of ""goneness"") that I began to laughCOMMA & seeming quite pleased that his efforts were so successfulCOMMA the man set himself to work to entertain me during the rest of the wayCOMMA he said he always kindCOMMA o' hated to see people discouragedCOMMA that he never got discouraged in his life & he thought it was'nt a good planCOMMA & so he got me into quite a composed state of mind & I was enabled to bear the rest of the journey with a tolerable degree of calmnessCOMMA it is well disagreeable things come to an end as well as agreeable onesCOMMA thee may imagine how delighted it was to be safely landed at home after all thisCOMMA without being either drowned or drenchedCOMMA they were quite surprised to see me arriving in such a forlorn condition.  If Father & mother had known they wd have met me at Tunkhannock.  I believe the reason of our having such a miserable affair was that the stage had broken down the day beforeCOMMA & this was all they had to send.  They are all very well here excepting father who is somewhat stiff yet with the effects of the rheumatismCOMMA the children have grown very much.  And now that I have almost filled my letter with an acct of my own doingsCOMMA let me ask thee about yours.

I wish there was some   hope of thy getting as good a one in reply but what with   colds & headache the little wit I ever had seems to have   departedCOMMA for which loss I console with my corespondents   every time one of my stupid effusions goes to the Post   Office.- I think a visit from thee & Clemmy would have an   enlivening effect & when summer comes so must you.- It was   very kind to send me that excellent Photo of Uncle DanielCOMMA   after my negligence in the<br>matter of which I have been duly ashamed- and I am very much   obliged for it.- We had a nice visit to him had we not? If I   had not gone thenCOMMA I fear I should not have seen him at all-   except that we did meet in the cars the other day- as being   sick in Wilmington entirely spoiled my Germantown visit. so   that I could make none of the calls I hoped to.-<br>How thee   must have enjoyed having Clemmy so long with thee. You had   splendid times I know. Indeed no one can be at your house   without enjoying themselves- At least that is my   experience.-<br>Thee knows perhaps that I have been a good   deal with my friend Lizzie Howell this winter.- Her mothers   death was so very sudden- only sickda little more that half   & hour- that the shock was fearful & Lizzie<br><br>was a long time recovering from it.- She is yet very sad-   and her brother being in poor health adds to the feeling.-   She was so sick for some weeks as rarely to get down stairs.   nervous & weak- but is now stronger & brighter & very busy   she writes me.- It is often a great blessing I think to   those in sorrow to have duties pressing upon them with must   be attended to & so the mind is diverted from its greif and   made to realize that life has yet much in store for them.   –<br>Did thee know our Georgie has been sent adrift from his   home into the city? We do miss him sadly- but he likes his   situation in a wholesale store in Market StCOMMA very well &    perhaps it is the right thing for him.- We hope that he may   be preserved from the temptations that summoned him.- Lizzie   has come home<br>for yearly meeting week.- We have been looking for aunt   Rachel Howland & her family every day but hear now they are   not coming till next week.-<br>Has thee been after “Trailing   Arbutus” this spring? [-] and I went the other day &  found   some pale blossoms. but very sweet.- Isnt it delightful to   hunt under the dead leaves for the delicate things- it seems   to make one feel young again fot the time.- Thee asks have I   read “Snow Bound”—Only a little of it &  have not happened   even to see it in a volume. But intend to get it soon if I   can.- The part I read was pleasantCOMMA simple &  [s-----] COMMA -   as thee says more understandable than much of the latter day   poetry.- We have been reading “Across the Continent” and I   have indulged dreams of someday seeing the “Yosemite Valley”   if my finances get into sufficiently prosperous conditions   for such a journey.- Don’t thee <br>want to go to Europe with the party that starts next month?-   It must be bery pleasant to look forward to & finer still to   experience if all things are fair & no anxieties to follow   you.- Wonder if John Wood &  Lily will go.- John says he   wants to & I guess Lily would not object.- I liked John   better than I expected to- but he is certainly neither   handsome nor dignified- but [-------] & kind hearted. I   should think.- Is’nt it a comfort Mary Ann Morris is so much   better? I cannot help hoping she will be entirely herself   again before very long.- Their house is very bright &   pleasant & I should think they might be very happy there-   This to be sure happiness is not a thing of outward   circumstances [----]Did thee remember that yesterday was the anniversary of our   dear Presidents death? Wonder where another year will find   us.- What do thy brothers think of our prospects with such a   man as Johnson at the helm.- It is a comfort that the crew   of out ship of State are so staunch & true.-<br>Suppose   Marry Emma Stokes passed meeting last third day- I do like   Alexander Wood very much. He seems so open & honest.- Will   they have a wedding  I wonder- or just be married & go   travelling.- I hear friends at Arch Street did not accept   Sue Farnum’s resignation. Had she violated discipline before   presenting it? The usual yearly mtg storms seems to be   brewing this evening- but I hope it wont come this.- Does   thee go in and out every day?.- Please excuse this [prosy]   sheet dear Annie & write very soon.- My love please to thy   sister E. – Very loving by thine<br>S S Reeve<br><br>,http://165.106.6.73:80/cdm/ref/collection/cope/id/1895,1895,26.cpd

Frank & cousin Wistar are very kind and devote themselves almost exclusively to contributing to her comfort & pleasure in every way.  F is devoted to Susan and does evey thing in his power to promote the improvement of her healthCOMMA his kindness is unparalleled: everything is done for usCOMMA and we have nothing to doCOMMA but join in the pleasant plans laid out for us.- Elizy H & Susan were concluding before dinnerCOMMA that they accomplished very little of any thing on account of the time occupied in changing their dresses for the different labors of the day.- About ten in the morning they prepare for bathing or rather we do when Susan does not go-<br>      /<br>      not arrive on 7th day tho' we intend to do so if possible.  the Boat did not leave until 5 o'clock this morning.  I expect the irregular lately.- with much love<br>      aff thy sister Anne<br>      Susan will accompany us to Hazard's this afternoon<br>      she is resting since her bath.then return about 12 o'clock.  restCOMMA until time to away for dinnerCOMMA then about 5 o'clockCOMMA a different costume must necessarily be adapted for Sailing especially when the boatsCOMMA are slightly fishy & a little dirty.- then we come home about ten-time or little pastCOMMA and another change must be made to appear at [---] which [---] will suffice for the evening.- but all this is done in a good hurry and I cannot say it consumes much time.- I believe I have nothing new to tell theeCOMMA and indeedCOMMA I expect it would be very puzzling to think of any such thing when Cousin Wistar is of the partyCOMMA for he writes home to frequentlyCOMMA and describes every thing that seems with so much minutenessCOMMA that if you are favored with the perusal of his epistlesCOMMA ours must seem quite commonplace; this is my conjectureCOMMA as we joke Wistar & Sue bothCOMMA about writing so often.- Only to think- Sixth day evening we leaveCOMMA if a storm or fog does not prevent usCOMMA and Tom has concluded to remainCOMMA and return with us last evening tho' fog was so dense that the Bay-State"" did not go outCOMMA and now we have every prospectCOMMA of the same thick state of the atmosphere for this evening consequently.  it seemed hardly worth while for Tom to leave before we did.- The Massachusetts arrived here with Mr. Williams on boardCOMMA about 11 o'clock thismorning having been lying off Point JudithCOMMA even since four o'clock.  Susan & Lizzie went to bathe this morning with F & Wistar leaving me at home to pass the time as I could.  Tom & Moses had gone fishingCOMMA and I was quiet enough.  Susan though it best notwithstanding your messageCOMMA to try the [---] three times faithfully as the Dr directedCOMMA and I hope she will not be any worse for itCOMMA and perhaps it may strengthen her afterwards.  She says she likes it very much while in the waterCOMMA but she feels pretty weak for sometime afterwards.  we think she is the best judge for what is best for herCOMMA and she does exactly what she wished in the Bathing line; Frank takes her inCOMMA giving her three waves as directedCOMMA he said the water was very warm & pleasant this morning.  I quite long to go in again but fear I shall not have an opportunity of going more than once or twice more before I leave.- It suits Elizy Hacker exactlyCOMMA she feels a little tired after coming outCOMMA but it seems to brance & strenghthen herCOMMA and shee looks better I think in this little time of our [---] here.  I do hope her father will telegraph her to remain with SueCOMMA if the letter does not arrive in time to answer it before our leave.- yester afternoon we were out Sailing in the bayCOMMA landed on one of the [dumpling?] rocks gathered some sprigs of green to pressCOMMA and enjoyedthe novelty of it highlyCOMMA it was really very pleasantCOMMA altho' by the time we returnedCOMMA our blanket shawls were almost white with the fog.  Sailing seems to suit SusanCOMMA very wellCOMMA but I think clear weather as a general thing is preferable to her.- This afternoon we think of calling at fr'd Hazard’sCOMMA we spent a pleasant evening there last Sixth day.  they are certainly a delightful family. Ann[a/e?] Hazard called here this morning with S & A Jenkins who are still staying with them – we intend riding out to see fr'd Jenkins before we go.- 4th day morn.  I was obliged to leave this shut hastily yesterday afternoonCOMMA as Thomas Hazard & his wife called upon us inviting us to spend this afternoon with them which we intend doing.  Elizy & Frank are much disappointed I believe in Fanny H’s beautyCOMMA but they must see her at [---] before they fully decide.  She is perfect at home.- my love to all- Susan and Lizzie are taking a nap before dinnerCOMMA and I cannot disturb them now.- there is a thick fog over they bay now 12 at noonCOMMA and it will [---] increase- Tom could not have gone last night in consequence of the bay as the boat did not leaveCOMMA and perhaps it is as well for him to wait for us.  Frank & myself do not think it proper to leave here in a fog or storm and Tom must not think it strange if we do",http://165.106.6.73:80/cdm/ref/collection/cope/id/1916,1916,47.cpd

But I suppose there is nothing more to be done about itCOMMA and we must try to hear it with a Christian spirit as father does.-<br>   Elizy sends her love to you all & is in better spiritsCOMMA than latelyCOMMA as she has received several letters from ThomasCOMMA he is still in BrusselsCOMMA and appears to have no very definite idea when he may return home.-<br>   We are glad father has sent for Julia to join youCOMMA as she needs a changeCOMMA I fear she confines too lately to the atticCOMMA and a little of your refreshing sea-breezes will revive her.  I think she has been concerned about GeorgeCOMMA as he hasbeen quite indisposed.  He is now much better and spent this afternoon here for the first timeCOMMA as the Dr. thought the ride might do him goodCOMMA but unfortunately he did not see much of JuliaCOMMA she having been in townCOMMA and did not reach home until near seven o'clock when he was obliged to go home to tea.  He says the Dr. pronounced his lungs quite clear nowCOMMA and I hope he will be able to accompany Julia to the shore.- Hannah Stokes has been here to dayCOMMA and intends staying over-nightCOMMA it is quite cheering to have a little company as we miss you all so much.  Thy letter this afternoon was very acceptableCOMMA and tell Clemmy I thought perhaps she would have favored us again.  I am glad to hear of the Doctor having slept better and hope he may be benefittedCOMMA my love to sister MaryCOMMA and mention to her if thee pleasesCOMMA that I have not received any reply to my letter to herCOMMA but suppose I am to get a bonnet for her at Jones' according to my best judgment.  but they think it is very doubtful if they can procure any other quality of [---].  it is not as fine as thatof which our sun-bonnets are made.

I haven't the slightest idea where the pictureCOMMA at the head of this sheetCOMMA is taken from;- but I know one thing & that is that I have not as yet seen anything like it nor do I think that there is such a view.  At any rate it gives you no idea of the place.  Now for the narrative- We took a row on the lake soon after arriving here & on Fifth day took the steamer down to [Bowness?] where we expected to get on a carriage & drive over to Coniston.  When we arrived thereCOMMA howeverCOMMA the sky looked so threatening & Alexis not feeling very well we concluded to leave it till next dayCOMMA & returned to Louwood.  Arriving in a heavy shower we were at a loss to know what to doCOMMA till I decided to go over to Keswick & get our letters that were probably awaiting our arrival there.  So as the stage did not go till 3 o'clock I drove over to AmblesideCOMMA bought a full rubbersuit (coat leggings & cap) hired a horse & started offCOMMA about 1 o'clock.  You can imagine me clothed in these things sitting on an awfully rough trotter nothing of my usual self being visible except my eyesCOMMA nose & mouthCOMMA and my shoes.  The suit answered admirablyCOMMA keeping me perfectly dry in the hardest thunder-storm I was ever out in- Except my shoes wh. in a few minutes were rather soggy.  However it was soon over & I arrived at [Derwentwater?] HotelCOMMA [Portinscale?] at 4 P.M. having ridden on horseback 19 miles.  Here I obtainedCOMMA first a lunch then the lettersCOMMA one from each of you.  While waiting here another gust came up & when it had gone over the sky looked brighter & more settled.  So having engaged rooms for 2nd dayCOMMA at 6 P.M. I set off & had a most beautiful ride past [Thirlmue?] & HelvellynCOMMA Grasmere & Rydal Water back to Ambleside wh. I reached at half past eight.  Drove downto our hotelCOMMA took some red-hot tea & then went out to hunt for Lilly & AlexisCOMMA whom I found spooning in a bench & who told me that there were three other pairs in the hotel worse off than we were.  Sixth-day we set off for Coniston WaterCOMMA driving alongside of Windermere & crossing below BownessCOMMA through Hawkshead where Wordsworth went to school & finally reached Coniston where Lillie & I made the tour of the lake in the steam Gondolee as they call it while Alexis ascended the ""Old Man.""  We had the best of it forCOMMA although he immortalized himself by leaving his name & address in full on top of pole of stones which has been placed thereCOMMA yet he was caught in such a dense fogthat he couldn't see anything & in turn caught a species of chill & feverCOMMA from which he is slowly recovering.  Yetserday we went through Grasmere & Rydal & got Lillie pretty well played out.  We rowed down Grasmere Lake & walked to Rydal MountCOMMA (wh we did not seeCOMMA exceptone window & the chimney's) Lillie & Alexis ""preferring rather"" to keep on a level while I crossed over the hill from wh. I got an elegant view of WindermereCOMMA Rydal WaterCOMMA Grasmere & [Tharlmere?] besides some small 'towns' and the mountains on all sides.  On coming down I overtook Lou & Alexis spooning by the roadsideCOMMA On my coming up they had began to talkpleasantly about the weatherCOMMA Lillie suggesting that it was much cooler than the 3rd of July 2 years agoCOMMA at wh. both looked remarkably pleased & mysterious.  I looked very innocent but on making ""comparative mathematical calculations"" have concluded that it must have been that day they drove over from Connymeade together & took two hours & a half (2 ½ hrs) by the watch to get up to the house from the stable-   <br><br>   It’s fearfully hard to get Lillie up in the mornings.  She grumbles incessently because Alexis & myself will order breakfast at half past eight & uses as anargument to the statementCOMMA (I wont say in fact) that Father when he was over here did not breakfast till nine.  Another instanceCOMMA Tom of the force of example.  However we dont give in & in revenge she gener-ally keeps us waiting 15 or 20 minutes.  Alexis thinks it is a good thing that we travel from place to placeCOMMA as they must think wherever we go that it is a mere accident that we are late.  This miserable climate dont seem to suit me very well.  In the first place the voyage knocked meCOMMA clean; for I caught cold some how wh. increased my sore-throat & I haven’t got rid of it yet.  It steadily increased till I got to Warwick wh place seemed to agree with it; for it has been improving since.  Then I had a boil on my skin which troubled me not a little when I ran against anything or Alexis hit me with his umbrella.  I have got it down to a pretty fine point now however & one is coming on my backjust between my shoulders so as to afford me an opportunity of displaying my skill in twisting my arms around.  Beer dont seem to be the thing for me at presentCOMMA & I have hardly tasted it since leaving Liverpool.  As to the roast-beefCOMMA it tastes very much like the same article at homeCOMMA and they put so much mint with the peas to make them green I suppose that you cant taste any thing else.  But the great charm is that every thing is so nice & clean- no greasy knives &c  You must excuse this writing; but Lillie brought us out here on a most uncomfortable hill-side & insists on sticking it out.  We saw some very pretty little ponies when we were in Wales Srubby; but as we are carrying very small valises & they are pretty full we thought best to defer our purchasefor a season.  I commenced writing on this sheet as you may see but Lou thought it was so important to write on pictured paper that I gave in- Consequently the above marks- I hope that Hazen may succeed in getting up his party & also that he will not ruin the horses driving too much in the park.  I have just thought of a little map wh. I have in my packet wh. I shall enclose in this letter with 5th and 6th sdays excursions marked on them.  Although it may not interest either of you I think mother will like to see it.

It wd. be nice to be able to spend part of our summers in Susquehanna Co particularly if you make it your homeCOMMA but we have not been looking forwarrd to keeping house in our return.  I do not want to live at Connymead againCOMMA (indeed I do not think any of us want to; unless we cd. find some one to live with us)  It was too lonelyCOMMA particularly for me.  & if we did not keep house there in winterCOMMA we cd. not keep very well keep house in summer.  How or where we shall live when we go homeCOMMA I do not know.  Indeed the uncertainties of the futureCOMMA & what it will be best to doCOMMA often weighs upon my mind.  Connymead is no placefor any body to live who wants to be a FriendCOMMA or who has any preference for their ways.  Life there was a continual struggle wh. I have no desire to renewCOMMA & perhaps we shall never know again [ever/even?] that semblance of a home.  I hope if thee and Lily picked to bring your children up as FriendsCOMMA you may be able to keep them in a community where Friends live.  For it is pretty hard for a young person who has been uninstructed in what are considered the accomplishments of life to have to live where these are considered all importantCOMMA & are the chief recupations of those by whom you are surrounded.  It requires a good deal of strength of character to be able to live aloneCOMMA I [---]COMMA & Friends must always do it more or less when they go out from among their own people.  When one has not been brought to play on the piano or sing or drawCOMMA or paintCOMMA or evento play cards- a not very valuable accomplishment certainly- & yet one in wh. English people who are both intelligent & sensibleCOMMA seem to while away at least a fourth part of their waking hours; & never to tire of- When I sayCOMMA one has never been instructed in any of these thingsCOMMA one feels as if one ought to be at least where they are not the chief employment of life.  Of course when living in a delightful pension on the Riviera- one is not supposed to be exactly fulfilling the normal conditions of existence- Existence here (the physical part of it) seems too delightful to be long continuedCOMMA & I have wonder since we have been here how long 14 human beings could live togetherCOMMA without apparently a shadow of sorrow or anxiety to disturb the delightful daysCOMMA which seemCOMMA to glide away without a cloud either inward or outwardCOMMA to mar their peacefulness such skiesCOMMA & such weather COMMA & such walks as we have- only one littleshower in all the two months we have been here- It is the most perfect thing in weather certainlyCOMMA that we have ever experienced.  If we had come last winter we shd  not have had the same experience of itCOMMA for it rained very much even here.  But I have digressed widely from the subject upon wh. I intended to writeCOMMA [---] the old house of Woodbourne.  Whatever may be my inclincation with regard to itCOMMA (& I certainly shd. like very much the idea of being able to live somewhere near you).  I do not thonk C & A have any desire to undertake housekeeping there.  The life of a travelling artist- or even of the travellerCOMMA minus the artist- in these delightful regions & pensions where have all the comforts of home without its caresCOMMA does not intend to inspire you with a desire to renew the contest with the [biddy?]- in art less America. If only some plan cd. be devised by wh. Woodbourne cd. be converted into a pension.  I have no doubt we shd. spend a good deal of our time thereCOMMA & shd. think the old house wd. need an immense amount of repairingCOMMA & as to the old chairs of the Conklin familyCOMMA I feel as if I had lost my interest in them & I shd. not think they wd. be worth the sum they mentioned.  It is provoking to have to buy what is your own.

We reached here the 6th of MarchCOMMA having left Mentone 2 days beforeCOMMA passing one night in Genoa & thence by the midnight train to Rome.  This being the only train (owing to their very insane & uncomfortable arrangements) wh. gets you here at a respectable hour.  It was a very uncomfortable journey- but then we were coming to- Rome!!  We made a sojourn of two weeks onlyCOMMA at Dr. Müllers- Mentone we thought lovely- Dr M’s house not altogether so.  It is not happily [---] being at the end of one of thos dried up riversCOMMA down wh. torrents of cold airrushed from the mountains.  We thought it much colder & damper than either Cannes or Nice.  & then there was a slight suggestion of boarding school about the household arrangements- & most for much open warfare between the Dr & his spouse to be altogether agreeable.  It is a great pity they have not learned to control their tempers a little in the presence of their guests at least- for at times it was rather to peppery to be pleasant.  Fortunately the storms seemed to be not very lasting.  & they were generally jolly enough- & in fact much more jolly then most people would be who were at their wits ends to make two ends meet.  A lady who was staying there with her family (pretty much as a matter of charity I fancy) told me they were over head & ears in debt & that she had come to the conclusion there was no use in trying to help themCOMMA as they never cd. keep any money- altho' they ask a very high price for their accomodations.  The excursions at Mentone were truly lovelyCOMMA & the Dr. was alwaysready to take us.  In fact we thought he quite preferred the ladies to the boys for he seemed quite put out once or twice at our declining to go.  but they were too hard for meCOMMA & I did none of the very long ones.  I shd. think however for those who were up to that sort of thingCOMMA Mentone would be one of the most delightful of the Riviera townsCOMMA tho' each one of them seems to have its own peculiar charms.  The weather was very warm when we got to RomeCOMMA & took the back bone out of me terribly- It however soon changed from mildCOMMA to coolCOMMA clear & bracing & the last 10 days have been delicious- I never was able to do so much walking in Rome beforeCOMMA & on spring afternoons such as these what luxury cd. be greater than to drive or to wander at will among the ruins all golden in the light of the declining sun- or to watch the funny old models in their gay rags & tatters- (wh. seem to [---] the spirit of the twins-) hanging themselves out on the Spanish Steps to be admiredwith all the rest.  Surely there is no place on earth like Rome.  Last first day was the kings birthday & there was a grand review- & the king & queen & the [---] kindly [---] themselves COMMA to our admiring gaze in the Borghese. It was quite too gay & disappointing to be proper for 1st day.  The usual ceremonies of holy week begin to dayCOMMA wh. is Palm Sunday.  We did not attend at S. PetersCOMMA thinking last year it was rather a sell.  I went to the little Italian [Waldensian] ChurchCOMMA a great contrast indeed to the pomp & [---] of the great Cathedral.  We had got back to our old Hotel della PaceCOMMA where we were twice last winter.  We went first to another but did not like itCOMMA & so came hereCOMMA where we found some friends of last summer (the Müllers).  It is a good central situation.  We look down upon the Piazza Barberinni & the old Tritan who is always blowing his stream of water into the airCOMMA & then catching it again all over his head & back wh. must be pretty well washed in all the years that it has been trickling over him.  Then on the other side of the street2<br>   <br>   is the Barberrini Pal.  & sad eyed Beatrice.  By way of variety the other day we went to one of Miss Brewsters receptions.  It was a kind of afternoon tea fightCOMMA of [---] & other distinguished persons like ourselves.  TeaCOMMA wineCOMMA & talk & many beautiful things to look at.   <br><br>   NextCOMMA we want to go with her.  Forbes the archaeologist to hear tge Forum explained on the latest authorities.  His explanations one said to be intensely interesting.  In fact Rome is so dissipating- there is such an infinity to see & to read & to learn that it is most distracting.  I hope we shall be here three or four weeks longer at least.  In fact it spoils you so for every thing else that it does’nt seem worth while to go any where afterwards.<br>   <br>   I ought to have told thee beforeCOMMA how glad I was to get thine & Agnes' letter at Mentone.  I was greatly struck with the advance of the latter's ideas since her first epistle wh. I have carried ever sinceCOMMA in the pocket of my satchel& wh. was composed mostly of kisses.  I see she is now advancing to the doll & the baby house interests of the little girl-hood.  The way the ideas were put together was very amusing- & the circumstantial acct. of the flight of the nurses & the changing reigns of the lady’s of the nursery very graphic.  Give her a kissCOMMA & tell her Auntie has very much obliged for her letter & thought it very interesting.  Also that she must’not cut any more holes in her apron with her little scissorsCOMMA but must make some nice little paper dresses for the paper dollys that Aunty sent in the letter.   <br><br>   22nd.  Just returned from our excursion to the Forum with Mr Forbes- two hours rummage amoung the ruins- intensely interesting- back nearly broken- head ditto.  General conglomeration of podiumsCOMMA TabulariumsCOMMA demolished temples & roman emperors- but quite worth the 4 francs wh. is the price per head at wh. Mr F. deals out his information.  He has been on the spot for some years & actually seen & superintended the excavations- so of course knows a great deal about itCOMMA & sees it in a very interesting way- much more so than [Hare?]COMMA who is a dreadfully guide booky old fellow I think- Am too tired to write more   <br><br>   Please tell Alexis that the letters of credit came a few days sinceCOMMA & we are much obliged for his attention to them.

Wherefore conclude she has been expending herself on that ancient & delightful city- & forbear.  Thy letter of-- containing the childrens photographs came tohand two days sinceCOMMA & gave much pleasure.  We think thineCOMMA with little EleanorCOMMA is the best of thee we have ever seenCOMMA & as to the little E I shd. say she was her Mama in miniature just as little F is his Papa over again only with a few shades more of jollity in his face.

For my part I dont see the use of undertaking to live in such a climate at allCOMMA as the chief object of life seems to be with most people to get away from it.  Why not try to liveCOMMA as I said to the Awbury people yesterdayCOMMA where such fearful agonies wd. not have contin-ually to be gone thro' with in order to try to effect an escape.<br>   <br>   I am very sorry for Madjy's disappointment as her letter to us showed that he hopes were very much set on EuropeCOMMA & she seems to need some change so much.  It is a great pity they have to undergo such alternations of hope & despairCOMMA because they have got [---] on the living side of the Atlantic.  At least it seems to be the side wh. is very much below par with most persons who inhabit it judging from the frantic manner in wh.they rush for the other shore.  The papers say that pretty much Ole America is now on the way to [---].  We concluded that the pleasure to be derived from seeing the playCOMMA wh. I think wd. be but doubtful at bestCOMMA wd. be very much spoiled by the crowd of cooks & other tourists who will infest the country. We therefore have chosen to spend some time insteadin Geneva in French family No 2.  Not that we were disappointed with our experiences in No 1COMMA but that we fell very much in love with this family last fallCOMMA when we took some lessons of them.  They are more cultivated people than the others- consequently moreinterestingCOMMA & tho' less well off- they are still frienchCOMMA wh. means that they are practical & know how to be comfortable on a little.  We only pay about half as much as we do at the large HotelsCOMMA with more real comfortCOMMA beside the very good advantage of hearing the best of french spoken.  The lady has two sonsCOMMA one a professor in the University & one a clergymanCOMMA & two dhrs. all highly educated.  The advantages of the education here for those in moderate circumastances are so very great.  We shall stay probably a month or more until the weather gets to hot wh. does'nt seem very likely- as we are on pretty high ground just outside the city with plenty of green trees & alps in profusion in the distance.<br>     <br>   My advice to you is to come & build a cottage on one of the hill sides of GenevaCOMMA instead of Woodbourne & get a Savoyard maid as we haveCOMMA who with her mistresses aid does the work for a household of 9 persons.  We have two dinners dailyCOMMA of several courses & very well cookedCOMMA & how in the world they do it all I cannot conceive.  I suspect that Madam is at the bottom of a good dealCOMMA but she does it all with such apparent grace & easeCOMMA that one cannot suspect her of cooking.  There are beautiful building lots to be bought hereCOMMA by the wayCOMMA on the high ground along the town with the Lake on one side & Mt. Blanc on the otherCOMMA & there are many beautiful gardens & suburban residences- wh. are quite unseen & [---] by the mere passing traveller.  If it was’nt for those children of yours whom we want to see!- I shd. be quite tempted to invest in one of these little spots & settle down for the rest of my days.  Will thee please ask Alexis to inquire of cousin FRC if he rec'd a letter fm. me posted June 8. containing a cheque for $200.  I also posted one on the 13 June to M.S.C. containing cheque for $100.

Is it necessary in order to effect a division of our property (I mean such a division as shall give thee thy portion at Connymead) is it necessary that I return to America in the Autumn with C & ACOMMA as it has been our intention to doCOMMA (or at least theirs)?  For myself I have not entirely decidedCOMMA tho' we have partly paid our passages for the 6th Nov. in the steamer ""Illinois""COMMA on condition that we can change if it seems best to another vessel of the line.  It is late to sailCOMMA but there seemed to be no good steamer between the first week of October& the lastCOMMA & as there will be no moonlight the last of October we thought it wd. be best to wait until the next moon.   <br><br>   There are many reasons why I shd. like to return in the AutumnCOMMA but the prospect of boarding in Phila is not very attractiveCOMMA & of keeping house at Connymead still less so- indeed I shd. never be willing to undertake the latter again unless circumstances were very much changed.  C & A prefer the former.  If they were willing to keep house or even to board near GermantownCOMMA where we could have the enjoyment of the childrenCOMMA I shd. come home with the greatest pleasure.   <br><br>   But this I expect they will never wish to do.  So that until I can think of some way for me to live in that part of the world.  It seems as if I might almost as well stay here- for boardingin Phila wd. not be much better as far as you are concerned.   <br><br>   The thought of staying by myself seems a little dismalCOMMA but I cd. stay very well in the family where we now are & be as well cared for as I cd. expect or wish to byCOMMA by strangers.  Then there is an elderly lady (whom we have met several times (& I think have spoken of) Miss WetherillCOMMA Jno. Price Wetherills dhrCOMMA of Phila) who has asked me to join her partyCOMMA consisting of her niece & [Pebers?] of Phila.  We were with them 8 weeks in Rome & found them very pleasant.  So I could stay very well if I wanted to- Tell me how the idea strikes youCOMMA with regard to the business- asCOMMA if my presence is necessary to the accomplishment of itCOMMA that wd. decide the question.   <br><br>   We still continue in Geneva & still continue to like exceedingly our french family.  We intended in comingCOMMA to stay a month & then go to the Mts.  But the weather has been almost too cool for anygreat heightsCOMMA & thisCOMMA so far (I dont know how it may be in August) seems a happy medium.  We have had a few warmish daysCOMMA but for the most part it has been a delightful summer climate.  Then too we have had so much gadding aboutCOMMA that we enjoy the quiet & the thought that we are learning something.   <br><br>   How often I wish I cd. have Agnes here for a few months.  It would do for herCOMMA what years of study at home cannot do for any body.  I never knew before how badlyCOMMA or rather how little we had been taught at homeCOMMA how to pronounce french.  Then too this is such a nice family where it wd. be so safe to place a child.  Their ideas about education are good- & they have so much simplicity in their ways & manners- they seem almost like those of friends.  The children have never been allowed to go to the opera or the theater- tho' they have oneCOMMA within a few doors of them.  Every evening before going to bedCOMMA we have a little ""culbe""- Madam Duproix reads out of a big bible- & then makes a little extemporaneous prayer- so very simpleCOMMA that one cannot help but feel as if it came from the heart; After thisCOMMA we separate for the night with much hand-shaking and many ""[---]"" & ""[---]"" & ""[---]"" &c- The great objection to the french is that they have to say so much about every little thing & are really too polite for comfort.  I think each person at the table says ""par-r-r-don""- about 50 times at each meal (with a very great trill to the r- & a very great accent on the last syllable) if all this wasn't accompanied with real kindness of heart (as in this case) one wd. become ""very fatigued"" of it.   <br><br>   We suppose that you are now at Montrose tho' we dont know it.  It has been a perfect age since anyone has written from Awbury.  I sent cous.

That I did feel and evince some repugnance to having a private conversation with thee- I freely acknowledge.  Why I did so- it is impossible for me to explain- unless it was because I supposed the one- we had previously had- was sufficient to elucidate all difficulties- and therefore a second one useless.- I regret now such a thought should have entered my mind- and why I felt it painful- to have a further explanation- when I saw it wd. afford thee a satisfaction- is a mystery I do not yet understand; but as all regrets are unavailing- I will not strengthen them by indulging inCOMMA or dwelling upon them.-  That my manners may have appeared in some instances- as they saysCOMMA cold and repulsiveCOMMA I am sensible- without my intending them to have that effectCOMMA at any rate- let me assure theeCOMMA it was very far from my intentionCOMMA to wound or hurt thy feelings for even as I wd. like my own respected- have I endeavoured to consider thine.------ I certainly meant to imply from what I said- I considered thee in faultCOMMA in not having sent me any intimation of thy feelings with resepct to meCOMMA throughout the whole seven months of thy absense; most assuredly- absense & silence were never calculated to cherish and increase a preferenceCOMMA which under different- and more auspicious circumstances might have arisen; & as thee gave me no intimation I was not forgotten- I had no alternative leftCOMMA but to believe as I did- thee had abandoned all idea of further intercourse- well then- considering myself slightedCOMMA and neglectedCOMMA how could reserve and coldness of manner be entirely avoided?

I will not tell thee what she saysCOMMA now- but when thee comes- thee shall see it.- I do not know that I recollect to observation thee alludes to- as having been made by me- when last here- at least I am not certain what it was.- The will find in me as usual- a very ready and willing listener to all thee may have to communicate- I hope my presence will not prove talismanic and cause thee to forget what thee had to say- I did not find it necessary to apply to Father for information respecting the time of holding our monthly meeting- it has just passedCOMMA last week- and the next oneoccurs- on the ninth of April- The [---] is- the first fourth day after the first second day in the month.- I had a sweet little note from cousin Edith the other day- it contained an invitiation for us to comeCOMMA or rather go out to make them a visit- I knew it wd. not be very pleasant just now and in my answerCOMMA declined the invitation for myself- and promised to deliver the one to thee when next we met- Edith styles theeCOMMA her ""cousin elect"" already.-  What an appalling spectacle the burning of the Wm Penn must have been- It will have an effect I thinkCOMMA to increase the fears of [---] travellers-.  How sorrowful I feltCOMMA upon learning of the death- of R.B.

Dearest Wm.

From the tenor of thy letter thee seems to think there has been an improvement is Uncle Wm's condition.  But though for a little whileCOMMA since being in bed- he was able to take cream againCOMMA to some little amountCOMMA he is now very low indeedCOMMA and taking only a very little wineCOMMA about a teaspoonful at a time.  TheDr told them he might not live through last night.  I came over yesterday afternoon.  About 7 O'clk  the girls and Edgar were around his bed.  He was asking about one or two of them; and who it was at the foot of the bed?  when told it was NettieCOMMA said he could’nt see- still I think there was but little light in the room- The remark was made that he had a good many kind children round himCOMMA I think he tried hard to say yes- but seemed unableCOMMA something like a slight spasm coming onCOMMA from that time for a whileCOMMA it seemed as if he might be dying.  but he again revivedCOMMA and was able to speak out quite loud during the night.  calling outhis wishes he does not seem able to modulate his voice.  He is very childlike and dependant upon those around him.  How frail we are truly!  Human nature seems to be utter weakness at such times.  He  has been generally & uncomplaining during his sicknessCOMMA although within a day or two there has been some moaningCOMMA apparently from weakness he dont speak as if he suffers much.  He seems very appreciative of the attention of his friends.  I do not think any of them now look for his recovery.  And from present appearancesCOMMA it does not seem likely the end is very far off and yet I feel as if it was hard to know how long it may be.  He is very very sick looking now.  By dear aunt Susans removalCOMMA pooruncle Wm seems of course more thrown upon his childrenCOMMA And it is indeed pleasant to see their kindness & attention.  dear Clemmie especiallyCOMMA [*] but perhaps I should not draw any comparisonCOMMA but she is the oldest and has felt perhaps more responsibilityCOMMA especially before her father was confined to bedCOMMA and others had stepped in to assist.  The girls seem pretty well and much composed.  Nettie is suffering with headache to day.  and Clemmie was a day or two ago.  Edgar does not look very well to me but he was up a good deal last night.  Alexis seems very well.  Of course thee knows the girls have been passing through a great deal.  but I hope the Lord has been near may an eternal inheritance be granted uncle Wm if he is taken<br>   <br>   *more striking with Clemmie than Carry & NettieCOMMA because of her former shrinkingClemmie seemed much distressed and unnerved last eveningCOMMA when her father seemed to be reviving againCOMMA and she had been in hopes it was almost over.  His groaning was distressing  to her.  but I do not know that he was suffering so much.  If it was sufferingCOMMA I should suppose it was from weakness and distress.  Cousin Frank and Mary Yarnall have been very kind and attentive.  We are expecting brother Thos out to night.  I will now close this biding thee farewell.

The pilots if I recollect first reported the capturing schooner to be full of men & black sided- it now seems they kept so far away that they could not see whether the ship was bright sided- still they alledge to have distinctly seen the cross in her foretop sail- This circumstance is the most strikingCOMMA & yet it is possible that at their distance they might be mistaken even in that.  I observe a story has been circulate in NYork of an oyster boat having supplied the ship at Sea- & that is believedCOMMA contradicted & reiterated- If that were true it wd. indeed be some comfortCOMMA as it might accot. for the whole affairCOMMA making some allowances for discrepancies.

Grandfather spent yesterday in town (which is the day I began this letter & was interrupted and it is the 15th now) and went out to Uncle Edward’s in the afternoon to stay about a week: from there he will go to pay a visit at Uncle Nathaniel's: he does not expect to return to Uncle Alfred's.

I have thereforeCOMMA not much time or inducement to propound to myself sentimental or metaphysical queries in regard to dutiesCOMMA problematicalCOMMA or supposed to be omitted.  I may be compared in some measure to an honest & benevolent day labourer. (not insinuating that I have a claim to ye character of benevolence.)-  if a distressed fellow creature cross his path or approach his cabinCOMMA no one is more willing to dispense ye comforts with which he may be blessed.  but he cannotCOMMA like his more wealthy & independent fellow-citizensCOMMA go in quest of objects of charity.-  ye call of benevolenceCOMMA shd. be heard & obeyedCOMMA and I freely acknowledge that it ought to be our aimCOMMA so to arrange our temporal concernsCOMMA as to be in the way of receiving benefit & advantage from our fellow menCOMMA or of administering ye same to themCOMMA as opportunities present.  this view & reflectionCOMMA I wish to bring home to myself.  but I have undertaken a business & entered upon a course of life which I had but little previous knowledgeCOMMA for which I had but little previous education & of which I had formed erroneous expectations.  it wd. certainly have been better on some accountsCOMMA if I had taken up my abode in a town or villageCOMMA upon my first making this county my residence.  if I had excluded farming & building from my viewsCOMMA my business wd. have been much simplified.  but I wished to select ye most adventageous situation for promoting the interest & settlement of Father's est'e: and I think by showing that I consider ye land and ye country good enough for myselfCOMMA a favorable effect has been & will continueto be produced.  ye difficulty of obtaining assistance hereCOMMA is a great drawback to ye comfort & satisfaction of ye farmer.  yet as I have put ye machine in motionCOMMA I must keep it movingCOMMA & as I am harnessed inCOMMA I must move with itCOMMA unless I have some one to supply my place.  I still indulge ye hope that I shall be able to pull things into proper trainCOMMA but I begin to think that it will require about as many years to accomplish ye objectCOMMA as I supposed it would of weeksCOMMA before commencing ye undertaking.  I am often however enabledCOMMA gratefully to call to mind ye advantage of my present situationCOMMA to that of remaining in the CityCOMMA a victim to disease.  tho' I am thankful that my circumstances are what they areCOMMA I trust I shall have sense enough to keep in view that I am not a man of fortuneCOMMA in ye sense that ye term is generally understood; and when I see how easily my income & more than my incomeCOMMA is fittered awayCOMMA and how little is to be seen of its effectsCOMMA I am induced to pauseCOMMA before launching out into expensesm without calculation.  when & howCOMMA ye returns are to comeCOMMA is uncertain.  a farm in a new county is indeed a quicksandCOMMA so great are its absorbing qualities; & we have to deal here with a shewd set of sharpers.  a man who is considered to be in tolerably good circumstancesCOMMA & is supposed to have moneyCOMMA must expect to be asked two prices for everythingCOMMA & they will be Jewed or Yankeed out of himCOMMA if he does not look about him with eagle eyes.-  Dr. RoseCOMMA to be sureCOMMA in ye course of upwards of twenty years has done much: but ye course pursued by one manCOMMA does not form a rule for anotherCOMMA differently circumstanced.  he has had a numerous class of settlersCOMMA of diversified trades & occupations to assist himCOMMA to whom he has sold land for good pricesCOMMA & from many of whom he wd. probably have obtained nothingCOMMA had he not have taken pay in such kind of assistance.-  Caleb Carmalt is similarly situated.-  speaking of CalebCOMMA reminds me of a circumstance which occurred at the last Friendsville Preparative Meeting.  he was presentCOMMA and John KiteCOMMA the clerkCOMMA objected to proceeding with ye businessCOMMA whilst one who was not a member of the SocietyCOMMA was in ye house.  Caleb said that he supposed he was ye person alluded toCOMMA but that he had proof of his being a member of the Society of FriendsCOMMA which he cd. produce if necessary.  one of the Hicksites remarkedCOMMA that ye meeting itself had no informationCOMMA or at least no official information of C. Carmalt's disownment.  a number of remarks were made in bothsidesCOMMA but there seemed to be a general sentimentin favour of proceeding with what was before the meetingCOMMA without further discussion or excitementCOMMA and the clerk accordingly complied with what seemed to be the wish of the meeting.-  this is about ye substance of an account given by a Hicksite to E. Walker.-  what I mentioned in ye preceding part of my letter with regard to charity & benevolenceCOMMA also recalls to recollection ye case of Uniah EstesCOMMA one of Father's settlersCOMMA who for ye last 6 weeks or 2 monthsCOMMA has been afflicted with mental alienation.  Jno.

WalkerCOMMA accompanying my accountCOMMA stated to 8 mo 23-'30 with Thomas P Cope & Sons (old firm)COMMA for which I am obliged.+- like thyself I have had misgivings with regard to a favourable result of the recent French revolutionCOMMA but at ye same timeCOMMA have been surprised at ye magnanimous conduct of the French people. Such moderation & forbearance when in powerCOMMA was hardly to have been looked for from a mobCOMMA I have also a more exalted opinion than ever of La Fayette. His expressions on the subject of ye punishment of deathCOMMA as well as some othersCOMMA show him to be a man of enlargedCOMMA benevolent & enlightened views. I was rather prepossessed in favour of the late KingCOMMA both his personal appearanceCOMMA & from his having used power with moderation & clemency. But I think it is clear that the present age is too enlightened to submit to ye control & influence of bigotryCOMMA or to consider Kings & rulers as super human beings. On ye subject of anti-masonry as recently agitatedCOMMA I have been slow in forming a decided opinionCOMMA considering that the tyranny of ye people may be as great as that of ye monarchCOMMA & being much averse to all species of intoleranceCOMMA whether practiced by rulers or people. ThereforeCOMMA though I have no partiality whatever for the Masonic Institution or SocietyCOMMA I think it admits of consideration & reflectionCOMMA whether ye mode adopted for attempting to put it downCOMMA is ye most properCOMMA admitting that it may be ye most effectual. There are cogent reasons for objecting to all secret associationsCOMMA but thisCOMMA does not appear to interfere with the rights of others. In ye Morgan caseCOMMAI do not think theCOMMA Institution at large is concerned or implicatedCOMMA & therefore I do not think it quite fair to use it as a handle against masons as a body or community. Providence in its wisdom appear sometimes to permit good to come out of evilCOMMA & it maybe so in ye present instance; but I cannot subscribe to the Machiavellian doctrine that the ends justifies ye means; nor can I believe all ye heinous charges that are made against ye masonsCOMMA when I see among them men of patriotismCOMMA intelligence & benevolence. I think ye purport of some observations of General WashingtonCOMMA in a letter to one of his friends is that the Masonic SocietyCOMMA is a harmless & ridiculous Institution. This I should supposeCOMMA from ye opportunities that I have had of judgingCOMMA is a correct opinion. Please say to FatherCOMMA that I have received the deed for Milton HarrisCOMMA & ye present to him my warm acknowledgement for the kind expression contained of sympathy as I have [received] from my city friends & relatives. They rob misfortune of much of its afflicting power & effect. I had expected that a residence in the country would afford more mental quiet & invite more to mental culture than a City life. But I find that ye excitement caused by the bustle of preparationCOMMA which I though would be but temporaryCOMMA still continues. And whether it arises from the habits of calculation that I have acquired by my mercantile educationCOMMA or from those implanted in me by natureCOMMA I cannot divest myself entirely of the uneasy sensation caused by ye idea of a continual outlayCOMMA without ye prospect of an adequate return although the amount of ye outlay would sound very smallCOMMA to a merchant or banker. I am ready to fear sometimesCOMMA that my present practical habits & pursuitsCOMMA will lead me too much away from the school of fancyCOMMA sentimentand moral & religious reflection. But I will try to keep up the strike for what is goodCOMMA & hope for the best. Geo Walker had reached homeCOMMA & I hope often to be transported to you in imaginationCOMMA as I have already beenCOMMA by ye narration & description of scenes & circumstances to which he was a witness whilst with you.<br>    <br>   With salutations of loveCOMMA thy brotherCOMMA<br>   Wm D Cope<br>    <br>   I observe in ye same inclosure with my a/eCOMMA a bill of T.S.

We shall always remember his as one who loved his fellow menCOMMA which trait endeared him to those with whom he came in contact. For many years he took a lively interest in all the out-door activites at the College and by frequent visits to the campus kept himself informed of the condition and needs of the grounds and buildings. On this account his judment on question that came before us was the more valuable because it was based on personal knowledge. He was personally known to many of the studentsCOMMA who were often helped by his affectionate sympathy with all their interests.

I have had two visits since I last wroteCOMMA & mighty nice ones they were.  Aunt L & Ellie came the first time (I told you I wondered  which 2 it would beCOMMA didnt I?) & after theyhad been here about an hour & we had a good talk Dr. Stedman came up and said they would have time for a cup of tea at the [---] House (his house you know) & that Miss Stedman was there-  Mrs. Stedman was away unfortunately.

I was sorry Aunt Lilly didn't see Mrs. StedmanCOMMA but I believe they have asked her & Miss Stedman to lunch with them at Brunswick so they will meet after all.  I was in hopes the Doctor would let me go into lunch with them some day this week but he thinks I am not quite ready for thatCOMMA so they are coming out again.  Mary & Frank came on Monday & we had a jolly timeCOMMA & Polly is coming out with Aunt Lilly & Ellie when they comeCOMMA I think.  Frank will come againCOMMA toosometimeCOMMA I guess & I have found out that I can call him up on the telephone if I want to.  I had a nice little talk with Polly last evening on that instrumentCOMMA & a few words with Aunt Lilly.  The latter is not very fond of talking on it& they have had some rather funny times I guessCOMMA as they have telephones in their rooms to the office instead of bells.  To-day they are Cambridge.

Of course youknow [---] or ""tea"" for themCOMMA & they met lots of people there.

It is so nice to have those you sentCOMMA & I want more.  I'd like my group of the GoldenWedding for one thingCOMMA & if there is a copy of that picture of Mother & me I want that & there is a picture of Esther in a little frame & one of Mary Emlen- & any others you can find.  I cant have too many-  If the frames are bulky dont send themCOMMA though I'd like to have the ones Esther & Mary are inCOMMAif you can manage it.  If there are any old kodak pictures of Awbury or Conanicut send themCOMMA tooCOMMA but dont bother too much.  You see it is so nice to have them to show to Miss Webb & other people to whom I talk about thingsCOMMA besides the phasum of having them to look at myself.

I have had two visits since I last wroteCOMMA & mighty nice ones they were.  Aunt L & Ellie came the first time (I told you I wondered  which 2 it would beCOMMA didnt I?) & after theyhad been here about an hour & we had a good talk Dr. Stedman came up and said they would have time for a cup of tea at the [---] House (his house you know) & that Miss Stedman was there-  Mrs. Stedman was away unfortunately.  He asked me to come downCOMMA tooCOMMA so we all went& I enjoyed it ever so muchCOMMA as it was the first time I had been inside their house.  I was sorry Aunt Lilly didn't see Mrs. StedmanCOMMA but I believe they have asked her & Miss Stedman to lunch with them at Brunswick so they will meet after all.  I was in hopes the Doctor would let me go into lunch with them some day this week but he thinks I am not quite ready for thatCOMMA so they are coming out again.  Mary & Frank came on Monday & we had a jolly timeCOMMA & Polly is coming out with Aunt Lilly & Ellie when they comeCOMMA I think.  Frank will come againCOMMA toosometimeCOMMA I guess & I have found out that I can call him up on the telephone if I want to.  I had a nice little talk with Polly last evening on that instrumentCOMMA & a few words with Aunt Lilly.  The latter is not very fond of talking on it& they have had some rather funny times I guessCOMMA as they have telephones in their rooms to the office instead of bells.  To-day they are Cambridge.  I believeCOMMA lunching with Mr. Foote at the Colonial ClubCOMMA & are at present looking at the glass flowersCOMMA I expect.  Of course youknow [---] or ""tea"" for themCOMMA & they met lots of people there.  I told Dr. Stedman I was crazy to go to itCOMMA & he said he would love to let meCOMMA but he didnt think I was up to it.  Perhaps I shall get to Class DayCOMMA however. <br>   <br>   To change the subjectCOMMA I dont think I ever acknowledged the little bookthee mailed meCOMMA Mother dearCOMMA from Aunt Lizzie Cope.  I [---] it all nightCOMMA & sometime will you give her my love & thank her very much for me?  Then the photos & the card-case Aunt L brought.  The card case is all right & so are the photosCOMMA but I'm going to bother you to send mesome more things.  Thanks very much for these firstCOMMA however.  The other things are- 1. the little lace tie to go around your neckCOMMA which Cousin Hannah sent me last summer- 2. my two lace collars- one of [---] edged with laceCOMMA & one of illusion with wide lace onthe edge- 3 my little gold pin (not a strap pin but a clasp) one of a pair I used to haveCOMMA & my little white wreath pin (that is if it is all right to send them by mail)COMMA 4 & some more photos.  It is so nice to have those you sentCOMMA & I want more.  I'd like my group of the GoldenWedding for one thingCOMMA & if there is a copy of that picture of Mother & me I want that & there is a picture of Esther in a little frame & one of Mary Emlen- & any others you can find.  I cant have too many-  If the frames are bulky dont send themCOMMA though I'd like to have the ones Esther & Mary are inCOMMAif you can manage it.  If there are any old kodak pictures of Awbury or Conanicut send themCOMMA tooCOMMA but dont bother too much.  You see it is so nice to have them to show to Miss Webb & other people to whom I talk about thingsCOMMA besides the phasum of having them to look at myself.  I do wish therewas a good one of Father-  You might send me the family group.  He is pretty good in that.  The one of the house you sent is great & I have it on my bureauCOMMA next to the boys. <br>   <br>   Now I'm going to stop this scrawl.  I hope you dont think I'veasked for a great many things.  Miss Richardson thinks my bloomers are in my trunk.  I'm awfully sorry.

HoweverCOMMA as we only hire the boat four days out of seven there are times when we must occupy ourselces in other ways. One of those days last we went on a picnic to Beaver Tail and had a splendid time the large express wagon up the Newport Transfer Co. sevred as our charist and pulled by four large horses kept in a gallop most of the way by our energetic driver we must I'm sure have made an imposing spectacle. The little cove where we usually go took on quite a homelike cozy air as it's walls reflected back the glow of our blazing bonfire round  which we sat while some of the musical members entertained us. I think I enjoy our Beaver Tail picnics more than any others.

I know he would be the last one to wish praise that was not due or ever praise at all but he would rejoice for us all together from this experience and to go forward with more and more steadfast faithfulness to the light that is given us. <br>   <br>   It is lovely being up here all together in the quiet peace  of the woods and hills with Frank and Ev and I wish we had theeCOMMA too.

We are; as this large poster at the top of the page is intended to indicateCOMMA I supposeCOMMA staying at this Hotel de Rome in Venice. Hotel de New York would be a more apporopriate title as the house is full of Americans. <br>   <br>   Venice is certainly a most picturesque and interesting place and would be a most attractive place for a long stay if it were not for the Italians and the smells. However in this last respect it is nothing to DesenzanoCOMMA which  has certainly pleanty of ""loacl atmosphere"" about it. We arrived in Venice on Fifth day (8/24) and since then have been trying to see something of the sights of the old city. It was certainly a most complete change to embark on a gondola and be rowedCOMMA paddledCOMMA or whatever they call itCOMMA to our hotel. It seemed as though we were living in a picture. Fortunality our hotel  is on the grand Canal and only about five minutes walk from the square of St. Marks. We have spent quite a good deal of our time about the last and have enjoyed the fine old church much. The more one seens of it the more you begin to appreciate it. The mosaics are wonderful and the whole effect of the interior of the church (though somewhat interfered with by scaffoldingCOMMA just now) is one of great richness of color. I think though that at least as far as architecture is concerned I prefer some of the fine onld English ministers. the Doges Place is also very fine in many ways but not nearly so attractive as St. Mark. The ceiling decorations are too heavyand intricate for my taste. We spent about two hours of one afternoon in a gondola on the Grand CanalCOMMA a most lazy but throughly enjoyable way of spending our time. Thee old canals areCOMMA I thinkCOMMA decidely the most attractive part of the placeCOMMA and the gondola seems to fit them admirably. We want from one side to the other of the Grand Canal and were finally landed on our own doorstep. A most easy and satisfactory performance. <br>   <br>   An emormous Italian (or French (?)) gentleman who is staying at our hotel is probably not so enthusiastic on this last subject as he managed to fall overboard during the performance to-day. Edward and I were aroused from the writing room by a great screaming of women and ran out on the porch expecting that something serious had happenedCOMMA only to fin this great lump sitting on the stepsCOMMA wet up to waistCOMMA and looking like some old sealion. He was so mad that he raged about in true Italian style and for some time refused to pay his gondoleerCOMMA or ""poppe"" I believe they call the man who runs the craft.  It was really very amusing. <br>   <br>   This morning we went to the picture Gallery here.  The colors of some of the old masterpieces are very fine but I am afraid that I am not educated up to an appreciation of them.  The faces are so impassive that it quite destroys the sentiment and feeling in the work.  Uncle Tom I suppose will laugh at thisCOMMA but I can't help it.  They are impassive.  Titian's ""Assumption of the Madonna"" was thr finest work we saw there I think.  The coloring and grouping in it are fine. <br>   <br>   To-morrow we leave for Milan and thence on Second day we expect to go up into Switzerland again by way of Lago Maggiore.  It will be quite a relief in some waysCOMMA for I don't care for the Italian people or their smells.  Please give Uncles Tom & Will and Aunt Carrie my love.  Also please give a great deal of love to Grandma.  Ed sends his love to thee and Grandma.  With much love from thy affectionate Grandson Ernest.

This morning Ed had to go to the dentist's to get his nerve killed or rather to have the dead nerve fixed; he has been pretty luckjy as he hasn't suffured hardly at all with it since he went to thy dentist nearly three weeks. FatherCOMMA Uncle Frank and Harold want up to tho Golf Club and played two rounds and Sam and  I went over to Whitall's and had a swim. MildredCOMMA Greta & Mrs. Whitall are over at Nantucket where they want the early part of tho week (2nd day with Bessie Norris and Mrs Kimber and Natalie. They are expecting to return this afternoon or eveninig I believe as father wrote to thee Ed and I went upon a voyage of exploration on last fifth day. We started on the the 7.50 Beaverstail for Sanderstown and thence we rode our bicycles (hired ours from Newport) up to Nickford Junction. The roads back of Sanderstown and pretty fierce for riding but after we reached HamiltonCOMMA a village about 3 miles upCOMMA we had good roads the rest of the 8 miles to Nickford Junction. I know we took the train down to Wood River Junction and there again took to our wheels and rode about 8 miles on up to Barbervillea little [nibling] village. We left our bicycles there and started to tramp up the Wood River on which we wanted to camp. We found that the river was well wooded and that the backs were steep and suitableCOMMA where not too steepCOMMA for camping. But the river sitself was a great disappointment to meCOMMA & I guess to Ed too; the channel was far too wide & shallow and the current was slowCOMMA and in consequence for some distance out from the bank the river was full of reeds & lily pads. I should tell thee tooCOMMA in order that thee may not think that we were exploring a second MississippiCOMMA that ""the river"" is not larger than the Wissahickon. We tramped up stream for about a mile and there ate dinnerCOMMA which was dry (hard boiled eggsCOMMA bread & butter sandwiches and chickens) and we had not water and were pretty thirsty. Not much satisfcation in that. Then we walked about half a mile on up stream and then the river broadened out into a marshy place where it received quite a large tributary in the shape of a creek which comes down from above Arcadia. We couldn't find the place and tramped by the creekCOMMA there failing to find it we though that the creek must be the river and came back and explored that for a ways only to find our mistake and once more we start out to tramparound in quest of the river. Now it is a little difficult to set out through a country where you are a perfect stranger to find a river which seems determined to loose itself in a marsh; and the difficulties are not much lightened by the country being full of little ridges which run up very steep to about 30 or 40 ft and then stide off on the other side without stopping to make any flat top. Well the outcome of it was that we gave it up and bring pretty well wearied by our exertions and also extremely thristy we returned to the creek & had a swim; then returned got our wheels and rode to Hope Valley where we each drank a bottle of root beer (quite nonintoxicating) and got a plain soda to help quench  our thirst and;returned to Wood River Junction by the train. In the midst of the trip it will doubtless thrill thy mothers heart with pride to know that the seat of my trousers had given way and that our hands and faces had more dirt on them that was seemlyCOMMA and for part of the way we looked like the convincing biker with a ""gutta percha"" faceCOMMA as Ed put it. There we rode a cross from Kingston in a wild hope of catching the six thirty boat from Sanderstown and in the midst of the way (its between 8 & 10 miles) and we had 55 minutes to do and my chain broke as I was riding down a hill. We missed the boat. After we had reached Sanderstown by a system of coasting down hillsCOMMA walkingCOMMA and in some favorable places bringtowed by EdCOMMA we took the 7.45 boat and again reached our ""happy home"" without having found a camping spotCOMMA but with a better knowledge of the country and so forth; so it was not all in vain. Well now I will try to give the a little more general newsCOMMA and not fill the whole letter with Wood River. We are expecting AlgCOMMA Art & Mary Emlem & Mary Jones on here on First day morning; it will certainly be great to see there all so soon. Tell Anna that we have been keeping a watch on some Vesper Sparrow's rest down here now Sam and ICOMMA chiefly SamCOMMA are studying a Grasshopper Sparrows nest. This very likely won't interest her very especially so there need not tell it unless thee feels like it; I thought it might on account of your [Vircos'] nest. The lady with the name will be able to tell you what Grasshopper & Vesper sparrows are like if you don't know. I suppose thee knows that ""teacher Helma"" Sutton is staying down at the Bay Voyage and at present Mr & Mrs. Haines & the two girls are staing there also Mrs. Alexander Wood and her sister Hannah Stokes are living there but are expecting to go home next week. Well as it is getting on toward ten o'clock and as the news seems pretty well run out I guess I will close with a great deal of love for both them and Anna. <br>   <br>   from thy Affectionate son<br>   Ernest<br>   <br>   P.S.

I am also sorry that thee missed thy sleep even though it was for the benefit of thy son.  I hope thee don't wake up at such times usually. <br>   <br>   We returned from [---] on Sixth day afternoon.  There were two crowds at the Lodge at different times- and so Margaret asked me to stay over I had a fine long visit from Monday morning until Friday noon.  KatharineCOMMA MildredCOMMA & Marianna Buffum and Mary Reamy (a school friend of Margaret's) went over on the 6.15 trip of the Conanicut with Harold and meCOMMA and arrived at the LodgeCOMMA via. MickfordCOMMA at about two o'clock Margaret and George drove down and Mr Buffum and Billy rode on horse back.  We welcomed them to the Lodge about twelveCOMMA Mrs BuffumCope and GeorgeCOMMA the coachmanCOMMA arrived about four.  Thus the first crowd migrated in small flocks.  Miss Blodgett came on Third day afternoon.  She is an East Greenwich girl and seems very nice and jolly though I dont know her very well -as I had never set eyes on her before she came to camp.  She stayed until FridayCOMMA but Katharine Mildred & Miss Reamy came up on Fourth day afternoon with Harold & GeorgeCOMMA so I was left a stranger among strangers.  The others who came late Tuesday night & on Wednesday morning were Mary Sands & Frida Paine (both Newporters) [---] Spencer and Geo. PhillipsCOMMA the last being a Boston fellow.  Now I believe I have catalogued the crowd.  Thee knows that the Lodge is right on the Qiocompang PondCOMMA a lake a little over a mile long and a little over half a mile wide.  The shores are quite irregular and are wooded right down to the very brinkCOMMA the underbrush overhanging the water in many placesCOMMA so the lakeCOMMA though small is very pretty.  If you paddle to the far end of the lake from the Lodgeand then push up into a little reedy cove and make a carry of about 30 or 40 yardsCOMMA you find yourself in [---] Pond- a small pond quite different in character from Qiocompang- as the shores are steep and there is a narrow stoney beach all around.  If you paddle to the far end of [---] Pond and then land and climb the hill through woods you can look out across the country and see the ocean beyond.  Which is a pretty nice thing to do.  I went down twice once with Katharine and again with Miss Blodgett.We had some good walks too.  The woods are pretty around that section and the whole country is surprisingly wild and unspoiled.  There are deer and grouse in fairly good numbers and they say that there are trout in the streams and bass and pickerel & pirch in the lake.  There are a good many nice wood trails to walk along and it is great sport exploring and seeing where you bring up.  You have to be careful though as you can lose yourself without much difficulty.  We had a great walk on Fourth day morning in a pouring rain.  Most ofthe way over (we went to Natchang Pond a lake about five miles from the Lodge by the way we went over) was through the woods for most of the way and through little trails.  I was piloting the party over and as I had only taken the walk once and that was two years ago I was a little nervous but by good luck turned out O.K.  Harold had been over this way with us the time before and Mr Buffum knew the general lay of the land pretty well so it wasn't so bad as it sounds.  It rained like everything and we simply drenched but had great sport.  Some of the girls went in bathing suits. <br>   <br>   So much for [---].  I'll try to get down & things nearer home.  If it suits you I am thinking of coming up to see you for a few days.  As I have just been away and as there are great attractions here in the shape of a prospective canoeing party on the Ten Mile River and Henry Scattergood and possibly Frank Stokes on Seventh and First dayCOMMA I think that I wont come up until to-morrow week Aug 22nd and stay until Sixth day the 26th.  If this don't suit you I hope you will let me know.  I feel as if I had been off on a great many side trips since this summer and don't feel as if I ought to be the one to go again.  It seems as though the other boys ought to have a turn.  But it looks now as though I were going to be this forward one again.  So I am looking forward to seeing you on the 22nd if all goes well.  It will be fine. <br>   <br>   Esther arrived yesterday and Elizabeth Roberts is staying with us too and as Stodgell Stokes took dinner with us we are quite gay.  Yesterday afternoon Katharine and I walked down to Beaver tail.  It was very nice down there as usual tho. there was no surf.  We sat on the rocks for a while and got back just about seven.  The rest of them took a drive except Harold who played tennis with Margaret Buffum at the club.  Esther Emlen is staying at the Emlens.  She wanted me to send her love to thee and A. Please give the latter much love and keep much for thyself. <br>   As ever thy affectionate son<br>   <br>   Ernest P.S. I think I will come up on the train leaving Boston at 10.00 & arriving at Littleton at 4.30 If Littleton is not the sta. please let me know.  Esther & Ed send love.,http://165.106.6.73:80/cdm/ref/collection/cope/id/3469,3469,1600.cpd

Last night Aunt Lilly & the girls turned up all right.  Father & I went over to see Aunt Lilly & Ellie in the evening and they seemed to have stood the journey very well.  We have been having a great time arranging about the Shakespeare Class.  When we received on 2nd day a letter from Aunt Lilly saying that it was very doubtful if they could get parlor car seats for 3rd day and that unless they could certainly have three seats before they started they would not come up until 4th day as Mary & Ellie very likely would be too tired to come; and when at the Tea meeting Esther said she did not feel like coming we became very much more doubtful about the wisdom of trying to have the class In fact father was so discouraged that he said he didnt ""care whether it ever met or not"" and that I could so as I pleased so I decided to put it off a week to let the Hackers and Annie Day know about our change of plans which I did with apologies.  Then last night when we found that Mary & Ellie would be able to come we again had misgivingsCOMMA so over we trotted to Ls.  Ellie encouraged us to have it this week at their houseCOMMA as Harold having the measles might scare some of them from comingCOMMA so once again we wrote to the Hackers & A. de P. telling them of the final arrangement.  I am almost afraid now to see them!!!  Aunt Lilly has enjoyed her trip immensely and it has done her a lot of good I have no doubt.  She certainly looks very well & is full of [---] while away. <br>   <br>   As father no doubt has told thee we went down to the Tea meetingon 2nd day & had a very nice time.  I enjoyed it very much tho the room was very hot & stuffy in the evening when the papers were being read so that I was very sleepy & could notCOMMA I am afraidCOMMA pay very strict attention to all that was being said.  Still I got something out of it & enjoyed the tea very much.  On 6th day 2<br>   <br>   evening Ed & I went over to a small party at the Whitalls.  Greta had home Marion Lane who is in her class and had asked Letitia Wright the EmlensCOMMA Jay Brown & Billy Kimber to come over.  We had a very nice time tho nothing at all thrilling.  On our way over I picked up a $10 gold piece on Church Lane in front of the Storks!  I have never had any luck that way before & could hardly believe my eyes.  I looked for any advertisements for it but could find none.  On 1st day I enquired I enquired of them at Church Lane but none of them had lost any money.  I asked Henry if Morris Bockins had lost anything as I thought he might carry some gold but Henry had not heard of him losing anything.  In the afternoon therefore Ed & I started over to Boltons to advertise the Ledger but left doing it on our way over as the boy at Boltons said it did not have to be sent before 5.30 to get in 2nd days paper.  When we got over to the Stokes Henry announced that the owner of my $10 was a poor woman in Irishtown.  I thought he was only kidding but he said that he had seen Morris Bockins after meeting & had asked him whether he had lost any money.  Mr B. said that he had not lost any directly but a poor boy who was coming over to his house from Irishtown with the [---]COMMA had been unable to curb his curiosity to look at the money which his mother had given him & his looking at it had dropped a $10 gold piece which he had search diligently for but had been unable to find where upon he was so much over came that he had run home at once.  The next morning his mother had come over & told how her son had lost the money & that her husband had looked for it very early the next morning but had been unable to find it & that consequently she could pay her rent.  The poor woman he said was very much broken up about her loss.  As these facts entirely agreed with what I knew3<br>   <br>   about the $10 there was no doubt but that the woman was the owner of the moneyCOMMA which is very satisfactory as there would probably have been a good many people who would have flocked to me if I had advertised and it might have been hard to tell who really did own it.  I am certain now that the right person got the money & am very glad that she has it!  Well I have written a great deal about this coin but there thee knows the likes details in letters thee says!  On 7th day our bowling club met & we had a very good time.  I enjoyed it especially as I bowled the highest score I have made this year.  Harold seems to be coming on slowly.  I am expecting very likely to get the disease as no one  seems to be very careful about keeping the doors shut but I guess it wouldnt make much difference.  It dont hardly seem worth while however to go over to grandpas as I think I have been exposed to it already.  Still we'll see what the doctor says.  I am very glad thee is enjoying thyself in a great way & hope it is doing thee a great deal of good.  Aunt lilly & Ellie talked to Anna over the phone just before they started (perhaps it was 2nd day night) & she sent her love to us all. <br>   <br>   I am thy loving son<br>   Algernon ",http://165.106.6.73:80/cdm/ref/collection/cope/id/3516,3516,1647.cpd

I suppose that as you will have fully recovered from any bad effects of the voyage when this reaches you it will be ok for my to express my present wonderings about your present condition.  I hope that you are not wishing like Ellie Garrett did that you were like a woman in Boston who hadnt any stomach.  I dont believe you are tho it is not so very long since you started and I am afraid that there is a chance that in spite of all opinion plaster;s etc the sea may still have its effects on certain onesCOMMA I wont mention names!  Well we are having not delightfully cool weather now.  It is simply great here at home but I can just hear those at Woodbourne and at Jamestown comment on their blessings in having it so cool and sigh for those of us who have to stay ay [---] in ""that awful heat.""  Well poor things it makes them feel a sight happier and it dont hurt us.  We have just had a circus of a time with a couple of fox terrier pups wich uncle Hazen invited in.  He has been keeping them down at the stable during his absense and Uncle Thomas' household have had a perfectly charming time with their midnight serenades.  Tonight he came home & brought them down here and they didnt do a thing but get themselves and every body else tied up and during supper time they raised perfect cane barking.  UncleHazen had to rush out a couple times to see the cause of the rumpus and now he has put them down in the cellar and because they are quiet now thinks he has solved the problem of keeping them quiet!  I have my doubts but am not saying anything just yet a while.  Grandpa and Uncle T. did not come down today after all.  Uncle Hazen received a telegram today saying that they would be down on 4th day.  I rather expect that Uncle Hazens stage party which comes off tomorrow night has rather discouraged them tho I dont know anything about it.  I did nothing during thr 4th except go over to Ros[---] in the evening and see them send off a lot of fireworks which were very good considering they were private.  The Goodhue kids were great sports.  Little [---] nearly turned inside out when a rocket or bomb went off.  On 7th day I took a Sabbath day journey out to Moorestown and played cricket which turned out desasterously to us as we were beaten 162 to 50 of which I made 10.  I stayed out at Moorestown with Stodgell Stokes to supper and had a very pleasant visit with them.  I had never been there before and enjoyed seeing them much.  Dr & Mrs Stokes inquired after you all.  I had intended to get out to Joes Morris' to stay over 1st day but I could not get in town in time to get out to Villa Nova before very late so I came home.  On 1st day I went to Frank Goodhues to dinner and in the evening went to Emlens to supper.  On 6th day Evening I went down to Shoemakers to see Anna & Frank Fortunately they were at home and I had a very nice visit.  Tomorrow Anna HackerCOMMA Mary JonesCOMMA Annie WilliamsCOMMA Frank StokesCOMMA Frank Strawbridge & myself are going up to Willow Grove.  I guess we will have pretty good time.  Tell Ed that I tried to getsomething for ASM but all the stores were closed before I got there at the Girard namely [---].  I will try & do it tomorrow.  I have not heard anything definite about my vacation yet but I guess I can have it sometime in Aug.  I am fine & well so dont be [---] of those who bother about the heat.

Thee probably has heard that she was not so well lately and on 2nd day Grandpa and uncle Tom went down for the day to Ventnor to see her.  They found that she wasCOMMA as they had expectedCOMMA much worse than when she left Awbury tho she was very glad to see them.  She had a great deal of 2<br>   <br>   trouble breathing.  Yesterday morning they up at uncle Thomas received a telegram from down there saying that she was worse and later on in the morning another one came saying that she had pneumonia which of course made them fear the worst.  Late in the afternoon another message came that she had quietly passed away at about 4 oclock in the afternoon.  Cousin MadgieCOMMA Ellie & John were all down there at the time and cousin Harry & Walter went down in the afternoon.  I did not know anything about it until late last night when I came home from the Harris (Joes) where a lot of us were at a porch party so that I did not get a  3<br>   <br>   Chance to write until this morning.  GrandpaCOMMA uncle Tom also had very little time to write as Cousin Eliza came over to supper (as cousin Walter had gone down) and Ridlgley Brown had also been asked to supper.  I do not know any thing further as of course we have not heard anything more.  I dont know when the funeral will be. <br>   <br>   As I said before she had been much weaker lately and her heart not been as strong so that they were very much concerned about her tho the Dr did not give up hope as she said you could not tell in heart cases how long a person might live.  When Grandpa was down on 2nd day they did not know that she had pneumonia tho she was much worse than she had been.  She was up 4<br>   <br>   when they saw her.  She had a bad night and in the morning the Dr said she had pneumonia and did not look for her to recover.  I do not know how she took cold. <br>   <br>   I have been having a great deal going on in a special way lately so that I have not had a chance to do all the things I have wanted to doCOMMA- one of which was to may Joe Morris a visit.  Alf & Henry are out there now but Joe & Ev go up to Woodbourne [---] about the 1st.  I have not time to write more at present.

It is lovely to think of thy being at Jamestown and I only wish I was there too to be with you:- Not that I am not having a very good time here at home; for I am.  It seems to me that every summer almost is nicer than the last.  Of course this one is still very young and it may be that I will whistle another tune before it grows old.  I am having a very nice time indeed with Alf while Mary is away.  Today we went off for an all day jaunt.  we started at about quarter of nine to drive up to GwyneddCOMMA planning to go to meeting at the old Hicksite meeting opposite the William Penn Hotel.  We thought meeting started at about 10.30 so that we did not feel very badlyCOMMA as we had come so farCOMMA at arriving at 10.45.  After taking ourseats and hearing the end of a sermon we were surprised and disappointed to see the friends shake hands immidiately.  We found that 10 oclock was the hour and we therefore only had about 5 minutes of it!  After meeting we had a pleasant talk with Jos Evans who lives in Owen Evans old house which is the house father and I visited and where our forefather lived.  He kindly asked us to come and take dinner with him but as he said that they had a good many boarders and he guessed that they could ""Get around to us all night"" we decided that itwas probably not very convenient to them and we therefore declined.  We then wandered along the road towards where Cadwalader Evans lived which is now owned by the HollingsworthsCOMMA and lay down under a tree in the shade to take life easy as it was a pretty hot day.  Pretty soon who should come along but Jack Hollingsworth and his sister coming down from church.  Whereupon he asked us to come home with them and take dinner which we were very glad to do.  Jack Hollingsworth also works at the Girard so I knowhim quite well.  He is a very nice fellow.  We found Henry Pleasants also there but Mrs Hollingsworth was out.  The house is extremely attractive inside as well as out and I was very glad to see it.  After a very good dinner and a very pleasant time we drove back to Uncle Franks where we found only Uncle F. & Aunt K.  We took supper with them and had a very nice time. <br>   <br>   Yesterday we went canoeing on the Rancocas and had a very good time.  Frank Evelyn Joe & Jack & I were the crowd and we took two canoes.  It was a very hot day but on the stream it was very pleasant.  The gentlemen of the party managed to get a swim while the ladies went wading.  We then cooked a very good supper for ourselves and every body agreed- even Frank who lost a six dollar pair of eyeglasses in the stream!- that we had a very successful day. <br>   <br>   I have not yet found out definitely when I can have my  vacation but I can not go before Mr Jackson returns which will be about the 12th of Aug.  In fact I could not run off right away then I think and I therefore can not come up to Jamestown before the 19th but I hope to be able to get off then or a week later.  I am thinking of asking a crowd up but dont know exactly who.  I guess the same crowd as last year except [---] who of course is out of it now both on account of her being engaged and Anna's being home.  Joe Morris will come I think O.K. and of coursewe will want some others I guess.  Will thee please let me know (or ask father to) who are going to be at our house then and whether you care to have a big crowd or a crowd at all.  Mary's engagement I think is very nice indeed.  I know or thought that John was pretty fond of Mary but I did not know that they were going to get engaged.  Altho Mary will be just as nice and good a friend as ever it will not make a lot of difference as she will not be eligible for doing things which we have always counted on her for when you wanteda person who was very good company to go off for a walk or a camping trip etc.  I have not seen them yet but am very anxious to.

On 2nd day we had our ""Discipline Class"" & on 3rd day Frank Ev & I read as usual.  The baby has not been as well as she might beCOMMA having had a slight [bilious?] attack.  So she has been a little more fruitful during the day tho she has been very good indeed when I have been over there in the evenings.  Ev also has not been very well as she has had a mild attack of hives which have however now passed away I believe.  While I am on the health of their family I might add that they heard the other daythat Ell has been right sick having had an attack of Gripp and there after getting better having a relapse from which I think she is now recovering.  It is too bad that she should have been sick just as this timeCOMMA especially as they are getting ready to move.  but it is a good thing that Aunt L is down there to look after them.  To continue the health bulletin- Father seems to be pretty well and cheerful tho his ankle does not seem to get much better tho he [---] it.  He drives a great deal and occassionally goes out to supper & dinner (I dont know how much he goes out to dinner).  We have not had very much company in the evening tho Davis came up one night and Frank & Betty were over on 5th day night which Father enjoyed.  I expect it would be good for him if we had some more company but it seems very hard to find a time when we have not got engagements.<br>   <br>   Yesterday Joe Morris & I went up to the Rancocas and canoed.  It was a very fine day in the morning and a pretty good afternoon tho a little disappointing after the way the day started.  We had a first class time by ourselves and came home with that comfortable tired sleepy feeling.  The main reason for our going was that I wanted to ship our canoe & Sam Emlen's up to Browns Mills so that we can come down the stream next 6th day which is Good Friday and therefore a holiday.  A big crowd of people which Natalie and Elsie have asked are also going up to Browns Mills to stay over Easter and Ernest expects tobe one of them.  Edw. & I were not asked as the girls seem to think that new blood is needed which sounds very well.

By the way Ed wishes me to thank thee for him for thy letter and also to give thee his love.  Harold is down at Atlantic CityCOMMA or rather in transit from Atlantic City I supposeCOMMA and Ernest has taken Esther Emlen over to the Shoemakers to heat some singing so they can not send their love.  This morning I stopped for a few minutes at Uncle Franks and saw Esther.  She seemed very bright & well.  Ed stayed over there to dinner and then returned and took a drive with father while Frank & I went on a good long tramp. <br>   <br>   Please excuse the writing blotts spelling etc for I am feeling rather sleepy & careless tho it is not late at allCOMMA the clock just having struck 9.30.

Thee sees thee suffers from the fact thee is so good natured about our short comings.  I am afraid I sometimes write to other members of the family and not to thee because I think thee will understand it is not because I do not love thee I do not write.  I guess thee does understand this but likes to hear all the same.<br>   <br>   I was surprised to hear thee started so soon for North East Harbor and I hope that gay house party did not wear thee out so thee was not rested enough to go.  I hope at any rate thee will have a Chance to get rested at North East.  It is too bad thee has had so much trouble with thy knee but perhaps a change of air will be good for it.  I understand it is rheumatism- isnt it?  There seems to be a great deal of it around.  The other day- last 7th day it was- I had planned with Ernest to take a walk in the afternoon but suddenly in the middle of the morning a little rheumatism settled in my knee and it got quite sore so we went up to the Rancocas and canoed.  I cured mine in a jiffy by rubbing it that night with [---] which I think is fine stuff.  Has thee tried it on thy knee?  I think it might help it. <br>   <br>   Last night I very unexpectedly went up the Valley to the Roberts with Edward Jack & Joe.  We had a very good time.  Elizabeth Perot came over to supper and helped keep things moving.  She has been having quite a bad time with rheumatism in one of her eyes but it is much better now.  We spent the night and retuned to Phila this morning. <br>   <br>   Tonight Ernest & I are expecting to go to Uncle Franks to supper and tomorrow we start for Woodbourne on the Black Diamond which gets us up there in time for supper.  I am sorry that Evelyn fine stuff.  Has thee tried it on thy knee?  I think it might help it. <br>   <br>   Last night I very unexpectedly went up the Valley to the Roberts with Edward Jack & Joe.  We had a very good time.  Elizabeth Perot came over to supper and helped keep things moving.  She has been having quite a bad time with rheumatism in one of her eyes but it is much better now.  We spent the night and retuned to Phila this morning. <br>   <br>   Tonight Ernest & I are expecting to go to Uncle Franks to supper and tomorrow we start for Woodbourne on the Black Diamond which gets us up there in time for supper.  I am sorry that Evelyn will not be up there but I am looking forward with much pleasure to seeing the others.  I do not think Edw has planned to go away over the end of the week so he will be out at [Dimdale?]. <br>   <br>   Next week I suppose will bring quite a change in the numbers at Germantown as people generally have to come home about the 10th.  It has been very quiet since we came back from the [---] and it will be nice to see some more people around once again. <br>   <br>   I suppose the family will stay up at Jamestown until some time about the 23rd though I have not heard any date mentioned.  Harold said he expected to come home about the 10th to do some work By the way I got from the barrel of Educators over at Grand[---] 5lbs the other day.  I do now know how much they are a lb. & I wonder whether thee would mind settling with uncle Tom for them.  I only took 5lbs as the barrel  was pretty empty and I thought I had better have some in it.  I think there are about 5lbs left. <br>   <br>   Family affairs move along very quietly and very reasonably smoothly.  Occassionally our fair Margaret gets a little ruffled under the collar but we have had nothing serious happen at all.  As her second childhood is coming on she gets more and more  forgetful so that sometimes I think it will not be long before we  will be summoned to table and find it almost unused.  The other night she admitted supper was late because she had put the lima beans on to cook but when she went to take them off she found nothing but boiling water as she had forgotten to put the beans in the pot!!  It does very nicely for summer time when no one is in a hurry but it would be a little annoying if such things happened when we are busy. <br>   <br>   The days are getting so short now we do not have much chance to play tennis unless we get an early start and as Ernest does not  get out of town until the 505 at the earliest we have not played much.  Edw and I however had a little practice.  We have also been kept from playing by a great deal of [---] coolCOMMA- almost coldCOMMA- weather.  Yesterday it rained very hard but has cleared up Today and I hope we will have clear weather over the end of the weakCOMMA though we will have a very good time no doubt even if the skies are cloudy.<br>   <br>   Please give a great deal of love to Grandma.  And with the same for thyself I am<br>   Thy loving son<br>   Algernon<br>   <br>   Also please give my love to uncle T. (over) P.S.<br>   I almost again forgot to thank thee for those very pretty little needle & thread holders which thee sent Harold & me.  We really appreciated them very much and they were most convenient to have. ,http://165.106.6.73:80/cdm/ref/collection/cope/id/3580,3580,1711.cpd

I am sorry I cannot tell thee that dear Katy is betterCOMMA her fever still continues tho her temperature is one degree down this morning. I believe I told thee the typhoid symptoms had disappearedCOMMA which conclusion I jumped at from hearing the Dr. say the trouble about the abdomen was goneCOMMA and tongue clearing offCOMMA but on saying something like it to the Dr.COMMA he replied he thought they seemed to be developing much more then in the first weeks of the sickness.  Dr. Newlin Stokes came down to G. Smith's funeral yesterdayCOMMA saw Katy and had a consultation with Dr. Sapington. Yesterday for the 1st time a few spots appeared in the abdomen and the Dr.s both said that was the 9th day of the typhoid feverCOMMA so dear child she has a long siege before her yet. It was a great satisfaction that Dr. Stokes said the case had been treated just as he should have done and he had no change to suggest except giving valerian instead of bromide to quiet her at night. They both unite in giving little medicineCOMMA only quinen to keep up her strength and all the nourishment she can take. Dr. [Lapingson?] thought perhaps Valentines extract did not suit her so we now squeeze the bloodOut of raw beef and give her that every four hours. Sam will send us down a druggists pressCOMMA which will be a help in getting the juice out. Both Dr.'s said we ought to have a nurseCOMMA Dr. Stokes said he know of one he thought we could getCOMMA Frank telegraphed for her and I think Thomas Cope will probably see her for us tomorrow and if suitable send her down. It will be a comfort to have some one who is skilful and can move and change Katy with less fatigue than we do. Frank stays with Katy part of every night and helps much with the nursingCOMMA but Katherine is so anxious and nervous I fear she will be quite laid up unless we have some help. Katy's fever is not highCOMMA 102 2/10 the highest her temperature has reached and todayit is a degree less. She has little disturbance of the bowels and no head acheCOMMA her mouth and throat are very uncomfortableCOMMA feel gummy and sore and she feels very weak and weary. Slept but little last night and the hours were long and tedious for herCOMMA she is very patient but at times is nervous. Edith seems to be gainingCOMMA is taken down stairs everyday and takes tea with usCOMMA Dr. took her temperature today and found it a little below normalCOMMA says she must have a little brandy. It is rather depressing for her and [Esther?] and franklyCOMMA we are so taken up with Katy and the house has to be kept so quietCOMMA so it is proposed for them to go to Uncle's for a few days and when Edith is stronger they may go to Awbury. If sister Eleanor takes Ellie away perhaps the girls could accompany her. I am glad to know you are better for Newport airCOMMA we had a very nice letter from dear Rachel please thank her for it and let her see this as I shall not have time to write to her now. I rejoice to think thee spent some days at Batemans and do hope thee feels stronger for itCOMMA thee will be lonely at Awbury with so many of both families away.

When I got home last 2nd dayCOMMA I felt very much used up with the heat & the change in airCOMMA but now have become accustomed to it and feel quite wellCOMMA tho' the amount of moisture in the air makes things damp & sticky.

E. Allen said after meeting today to Eleanor & meCOMMA that after sheheard of E.W.

I rode to the ground with cousin Rebecca EvansCOMMA she spoke of cousin ElizabethCOMMA said the letter thee wrote her had been such a particular comfort and help to herCOMMA that Rebecca had felt she must write & tell thee but has been rather burdened with callsCOMMA so I said I would let thee know about itCOMMA I think R sent her love to thee.

Cousin Wm & John Rhoads have gone to T. Brown's camp for their vacation.  I send thee one of Esthers letters as thee may be interested to hear something of the Conference.

To-day is another cloudy day though early this morning the sun was shining.  It has now been cloudy since a week ago yesterday and we have decided that it would be nice if it would clear up.  We had quite a large meeting this morning.  Phoebe Gifford who they say is within ten months of being a hundred was there and spoke a few words.  Elsie Bettle and Mrs. Wright drove up with Miss Hacker.  Father and Aunt Hannah and Ernest took a driveafter meeting-  Edward came down with the Kimbers and Sam and I walked.  Aunt Hannah is going home to-night but Sam is going to wait and go down with Uncle Frank Stokes whoCOMMA I believeCOMMA is going to bring Aunt Kate up on third day. <br>   <br>   We had fresh corn for dinner yesterday and it certainly was good.  It seems very early for it but they say it is ""island corn.""  Tonight we are going over to Buffums to hear them sing hymns. <br>   <br>   May Emlen came up on Sixth day by train and I think she is going over too.  Little Franklin NordhoffCOMMA who thee knows broke both armsCOMMA now has them out of the slings and can use them. Tell Anna that that roll of films which we had developed at Rolfes have been sent on by Alg.  They certainly do look weird.  Thee knows that Aunt Hannah went to Morris Leeds and sent him some of that blue flower that grows up at Conanicut Park.  He did not know what it was but found out from Stewardson Brownthat it was an English flower called Sheeps-bit Jasione MontanaCOMMA and that it only grew in certain parts of Rhode Island and Connecticut. <br>   <br>   The golf club is a great success and has over 250 members.  The other day father went round in 62 strokes which is the family record.  A gentlemen named [---]W. Kemble went round in 37 the other day and broke the professional record by six.  Yesterday Father and Aunt Hannah went down to Shoemakers to call but found that they were out.  After they came home Father and I took a little drive up the island and met Uncle Theo.  He said that Aunt Anna has been quite sick with the abcess on her throat but was better now. <br>   <br>   It is after dinner time now and as Edward is writing to Anna and Father will probably write another letter to thee I think I will close. <br>   <br>   I am thy loving son<br>   Harold<br>   <br>   Give my love to Anna and tell her I expect to print some pictures from those films and will send her some when finished.

The Sophomore-Freshman debate caame off the Third-day of the week after I saw youCOMMA and so I was pretty busy preparing for that.  Unfortunately we lost.  It was the first thing the Freshmen had beaten us inCOMMA so we were rather sour.  Then the next night came the Entertainment for the Preston Boys' Club.  I had no idea of staying till the dance but go to talking and didn't get back till after twelve!  It was very good fun and I enjoyed it very much.  It is rather good fun to watch other people dance even though you don't dance yourself.  It was a success financially tooCOMMA and we cleared $156.25 all of whichCOMMA I am glad to say was given to the Boys' Club through Dr. Babbitt.  For a wonder the newspaper report about Emily Fox and the Biddles was true except that I think it was greatly exaggerated.  Detectives have been put on the caseCOMMA I believe and they hope to recover at least some of the things.  I don't know whether they think they lost it or that it was stolen.  It certainly was mighty hard luck as I believe some of Emily's things were valuable on account of being heir looms. <br>   <br>   Ernest's kneeCOMMA I think is just about all right.  He can walk around on it all right but I imagine it is still weak. <br>   <br>   The weather here has been quite warm and the snow has been melting pretty fastCOMMA but there is a good deal of ice over things and it takes a good while to melt that off.  To-day however is quite cool againCOMMA though I imagine it will warm up toward the middle of the day as the sun has so much power.  It sounds fine to hear of May days and violets and daffodils but it will not be so very long before we too shall be getting springCOMMA for here it is about a third of  the way through March.  It certainly seems funny to think that there are only three more weeks of the third quarter left; for the fourth quarter goes by like grease-lightening.  I am glad I am not in Ernest's shoes. <br>   <br>   To-night the gymnasium competition with Lehigh University comes off and I certainly hope we win.  Last week our team went up to RutgersCOMMA and when the last event began we were several points behindCOMMA but we won the event and the meet by one point!  I hope it will be as exciting to-night. <br>   <br>   It is fine to hear of all that Anna can do.  Please give her a great deal of love from me and tell her that this letter is for her too.  I suppose thee has heard of President Sharpless' illness.  He has not been at college for nearly three weeksCOMMA I think.  They took him into the Pennsylvania Hospital where Fred Sharpless  is one of the physiciansCOMMA but he is better now. <br>   <br>   Last Fourth day afternoon we had another festivity in the way of a Faculty tea for the Sophomores.  It was rather good funCOMMA though I don't think much of teas.  They are too stiff and formal. <br>   <br>   I think I shall have to cry a halt as my slender stock of news is about exhausted.

I wrote to Mr. Wood on Sixth day and I suppose he has received it by this time.  It is rather a new experience writing to elderly gentlemenCOMMA so I hope I didn't say anything queer. <br>   <br>   Art Brown arrived a week ago last First-day and he and Paul and I had a very good time.  Art is very different from the rest of mankind- he is so very anxious to please and writes letters at such an awful rate.  In one mail he sent eight or nine letters including postals.  Isn't that awful? We jollied him a great dealCOMMA Paul and ICOMMA too much I am afraidCOMMA but he was so good-natured about it that it was hard to know when to stop.  On Third-dayCOMMA after we had been to tennisCOMMA Margaret Mellor asked us all to go out sailing.  I could not go as I had to play in the tennis tournamentCOMMA but Paul and Art went and had a rather amusing time.  Then she asked us down to a marshmallow roast on Fifth-day night.  We were not very keen about going but nevertheless went and had a very crazy time.  In the first place the crowd did not know each other at allCOMMA- some of them were very gay and sporty while others were sedate and sober like myself.  Paul and Art spent most of the time having a marshmallow fight.  Eleanor Haydock was there (this was the one saving feature of the evening) and so I managed to survive.  The consequence of these two invitations wasthat we decided we ought to try to do some thing in return.  Sixth-day was Arts last day so we tried to find out what he wanted to do and finally decided to take a sail in the morning and the Ocean Drive in the afternoon.  Paul decided he would rather play tennis so Art and I went down to the Bay Voyage and asked Margaret Mellor and Eleanor Haydock to go.  I am not especially keen about Margaret Mellorm so sheCOMMA of courseCOMMA wentCOMMA while EleanorCOMMA who was staying at [---] Wharton'sCOMMA decided she had better return and see whether they had anything for her to do.  We took three large fat magazines and managed to have a pretty good time.  In the afternoon we took the Ocean Drive and nearly died laughing.  The swells were out in force with their footmen and coachmenCOMMA andCOMMA as<br>Paul and Art were not much used to themCOMMA some of their remarks were very amusing.  They kept speaking to the different ones they passed and then went off in fits of laughter.  We drove back over the hills back of the golf-courseCOMMA and it certainly was mighty pretty.  Art left that night and went down to Elsie Smith's house-party the next day.  Paul left on Seventh day morning on the nine o'clock train for Boston and went up to the White Mts (as far as Plymouth by the same train as we took).  He is at present at the Flume HouseCOMMA and I should not be so very much surprised if he came over your way some of these days.  His father and motherCOMMA Ellis and he are going to stay there for a couple of weeks and Paul told me that his father had been going up there for the last fifty years and had only missed about<br>ten.  I don't know whether this is true or not but Paul said so!  Alg and the rest of the crowd arrived about an hour after Paul departed this island (You say ""departed this life"" so I don't see why you should not say ""departed this island"").  Things began to move [instanter?] and the first thing done was a game of roof-ball in which Art and I defeated Joe and Alg most ignominiously after which we inquired if they could play marbles or any such game!  A little baby-in-the-hat was the result but unfortunately was interrupted by swimming.  On Seventh-day afternoon Jim asked me to race with him in his new half-rater (15 footer).  I accepted with great pleasure and went down to Whitall's to lunch.  Six of the little boatsCOMMA all exactly alikeCOMMA started.  There were two of E.D. Morgan's (one sailed by his daughter and the other byhis son) one of the Lippitt'sCOMMA on of the Wetherill's and one sailed by Miss Grosvenor.  Miss Morgan did not understand the course and started off wrongCOMMA but instead of giving up the race she kept her nerve and came chasing after us.  When we rounded the last buoy we were third but were soon passed by another boat.  From that time on Miss Morgan and we did not follow the rest but showed our independenceCOMMA and we won while she came in second.  I was pretty nearly as glad to see her beat the rest of them as I was that we won.  It was Jim's first victory so I think I must have been his mascot!  When we awoke on First-day morning a good old southeaster was snoring outside but we braved the elements and went to meeting.  Comong home it rained so hard that it went right through my rain coatCOMMAand rendered thy little Willie boy quite damp.  Second-day was still fine and wet so we fooled round the house most of the day.  In the morning we read a couple of Kenneth Grahame's ""Dream Days"" storiesCOMMA and they certainly are pretty good.  We also read a crazy story by Paul [---] entitled ""Love Will Find a Way"" and ""The Maltese Cat"" by Rudyard Kipling.  In the afternoon we tried to take a sail but failed as Father had told the captain he could have a holiday.  However we went up to Whitall's and Greta and Alg and I went out  in a row-boat with a sail in it.  The little craft went sideways pretty nearly as fast as it did forwards so we did not get very far.  The rest of them went out in the rowboat and took a row.  This morning was cloudywhen we got upCOMMA but we had decided to go on a picnic over to Gilbert Stuart's so we did and before we had fairly started the sun shone forth in all his grandeur and we had a fine day.  I took Colin along and he behaved very well and seemed to enjoy it though he was pretty tired before we got home.  Altogether we walked about thirteen miles so thee sees we had plenty of exercise.  After lunch we walked back toward Kingston and got a good view of the country.  We had to hustle back to catch the five-thirty boatCOMMA but when we got to Saunders town we found we had time enough to eat some ice cream at a fair that was going on behind the hotel.  We walked over from the West Ferry and then JoeCOMMA ArtCOMMA Alg and I took a short swim at Whitall's.  It is getting pretty lateCOMMA the news and this sheet are rapidly coming to a close and I am tired so good night.With lots of love for both thee and Anna<br>   I am as ever<br>   Harold<br>   <br>   Please give my love to Miss Richardson.  Katherine and Jacquee say to thank thee very much for thy letter.  If any of you think of it you can remember me to the Leeds and the Hodges.

The voyage was most enjoyable for there were some very jolly people on board and there was lots of deck-room for games. <br>   <br>    Since landing we have had a good deal of rainy weather but we don't seem to mind rain at allCOMMA and it has not interfered with our plans except once or twice when we have taken the coach instead of walking in the rain. The cold tooCOMMA for it has been pretty chilly at timesCOMMA has been rather a blessing than otherwise for it has made our walks and sightseeing tours all the more enjoyableCOMMA and the soft coal fires have been very nice and cheerful. <br>    <br>   Our trip through Devonshire was a great successCOMMA though we can scarcely call it a walking trip as we walked only two days instead of four. From London we went straight to TintagelCOMMA arriving there Seventh day evening. The cliffs are perfectly magnificent and we spent most of First day morning admiring them from King Arthur's Castle which is on a beautiful promontory. Finding it was impossible to get our bags to Bude on the Sabbath we took the only course open and drove thereCOMMA  taking them with us. It was disappointing to miss the walkCOMMA but we had the more time at Tintagel of which we were very glad. Bude was rather uninterestingCOMMA but the walk from there to Clovelly is certainly charmingly quaintCOMMA though the tourists haveCOMMA I supposeCOMMA come in such swarms that it seems as though the place were artificially natural (if you can guess what I mean by that). From Clovelly we went to Ilfracombe by boat and thence we coached to Lynton. Here again we had expected to walk but were again preventedCOMMA this time by rain. Lynton and Lynmouth took my fancy very muchCOMMA and Paul Brown and I had a delightful walk up the Valley of the Lyn to Watermeet (where the East and West Lyn come together)The next day we walked to Porlock in spite of the rain.  We were very fortunateCOMMA howeverCOMMA and each time a shower overtook us we were able to reach shelter.  The darkCOMMA low-flying clouds with here and there a burst of sunshine rather added to the wildness of Exmoor and it was not hard to imagine that the Doones might almost still be living in some of the wild valleys.  We saw a herd of the wild Exmoor ponies but were not fortunate enough to see any of the red-deer which we were told at Porlock are not at all uncommon.  From Porlock we went to Tintern by train.  It was a rather tedious journey with a good deal of waiting.  The two place are only about thirty miles apart in a straight lineCOMMA but it took us six hours toreach our destination.<br>   <br>   Tintern Abbey is a fine old ruin and takes you back to the Middle AgesCOMMA giving the whole town an air of antiquity.  The little chapel on the hillCOMMA which they say is older than the abbey was also very interesting and we spent last Seventh-day morning (till train time) wandering around them and taking pictures of them.<br>   <br>   We came straight to Chester from TinternCOMMA and I must say I was rather disappointed in it.  The Cathedral is fine but the Walls do not amount to very much it seems to one.  We left here First-day evening and went to Carnarvon where we were very much interested in the Castle which dates I believe from 1256.  At Carnarvon the rain again interfered with our walkingCOMMA and this time it rained so hard that the coach did not run and we were obliged to go to Bedd-gelert by train.  In some ways Bedd-gelert appeals to me more than most of the places we have seen.  It is such a quiet little townCOMMA ""far from the madd'ning crowd's ignoble strifeCOMMA"" nestled in the heart of the Welsh MtsCOMMA that I felt I should like to have more time there.  In the afternoon it stopped raining and we walked down the Pass of Aberglaslyn where they say the cliffs rise eight hundred feet from the road.  It is especially fine now as the recent rains have filled the streams very full and the little brooks tumbling over themselves down the mountainsides are very beautiful.<br>   <br>   When we awoke the next morning we were again greeted by the pleasant patter of rainCOMMA but we decided to walk to Beltus-y-coed at any rate.  I am very glad we did as it soon stopped raining and it was a very pretty walk.  At Capel-Curig we again saw the king (we had seen him twice in London) this time in plain every-day clothes in an automobileCOMMA on his way to Carnarvon.  The people had gathered from far and near and greeted him enthusiastically.  I was interested to her them sing the Welsh national anthem in their native languageCOMMA which is certainly most unintelligible.  This morning we returned here and this afternoon visited the Cathedral after which Arthur and I went to see Eaton HallCOMMA the Duke of Westminster's place.  As he is now in London we were allowed to go over his houseCOMMA of course for a shillingCOMMA (everything is for a shilling) and were very much interestedto see how he lives.  It is a most magnificent placeCOMMA ""rich but not gaudy"" and somehow seems much more ""fit"" than some of the summer cottages at NewportCOMMA though I imagineCOMMA as far as money goes that Newport's ""cozy little cottages"" are quite as grand.  Eaton Park is a beautiful stretch of land about three miles (or more) long and the deer grazing in the open fields were very pretty.<br>   <br>   I have now come to the end of my letterCOMMA and as it is growing late I must close.

The voyage was most enjoyable for there were some very jolly people on board and there was lots of deck-room for games. <br>   <br>    Since landing we have had a good deal of rainy weather but we don't seem to mind rain at allCOMMA and it has not interfered with our plans except once or twice when we have taken the coach instead of walking in the rain. The cold tooCOMMA for it has been pretty chilly at timesCOMMA has been rather a blessing than otherwise for it has made our walks and sightseeing tours all the more enjoyableCOMMA and the soft coal fires have been very nice and cheerful. <br>    <br>   Our trip through Devonshire was a great successCOMMA though we can scarcely call it a walking trip as we walked only two days instead of four. From London we went straight to TintagelCOMMA arriving there Seventh day evening. The cliffs are perfectly magnificent and we spent most of First day morning admiring them from King Arthur's Castle which is on a beautiful promontory. Finding it was impossible to get our bags to Bude on the Sabbath we took the only course open and drove thereCOMMA  taking them with us. It was disappointing to miss the walkCOMMA but we had the more time at Tintagel of which we were very glad. Bude was rather uninterestingCOMMA but the walk from there to Clovelly is certainly charmingly quaintCOMMA though the tourists haveCOMMA I supposeCOMMA come in such swarms that it seems as though the place were artificially natural (if you can guess what I mean by that). From Clovelly we went to Ilfracombe by boat and thence we coached to Lynton. Here again we had expected to walk but were again preventedCOMMA this time by rain. Lynton and Lynmouth took my fancy very muchCOMMA and Paul Brown and I had a delightful walk up the Valley of the Lyn to Watermeet (where the East and West Lyn come together)The next day we walked to Porlock in spite of the rain.  We were very fortunateCOMMA howeverCOMMA and each time a shower overtook us we were able to reach shelter.  The darkCOMMA low-flying clouds with here and there a burst of sunshine rather added to the wildness of Exmoor and it was not hard to imagine that the Doones might almost still be living in some of the wild valleys.  We saw a herd of the wild Exmoor ponies but were not fortunate enough to see any of the red-deer which we were told at Porlock are not at all uncommon.  From Porlock we went to Tintern by train.  It was a rather tedious journey with a good deal of waiting.  The two place are only about thirty miles apart in a straight lineCOMMA but it took us six hours toreach our destination.<br>   <br>   Tintern Abbey is a fine old ruin and takes you back to the Middle AgesCOMMA giving the whole town an air of antiquity.  The little chapel on the hillCOMMA which they say is older than the abbey was also very interesting and we spent last Seventh-day morning (till train time) wandering around them and taking pictures of them.<br>   <br>   We came straight to Chester from TinternCOMMA and I must say I was rather disappointed in it.  The Cathedral is fine but the Walls do not amount to very much it seems to one.  We left here First-day evening and went to Carnarvon where we were very much interested in the Castle which dates I believe from 1256.  At Carnarvon the rain again interfered with our walkingCOMMA and this time it rained so hard that the coach did not run and we were obliged to go to Bedd-gelert by train.  In some ways Bedd-gelert appeals to me more than most of the places we have seen.  It is such a quiet little townCOMMA ""far from the madd'ning crowd's ignoble strifeCOMMA"" nestled in the heart of the Welsh MtsCOMMA that I felt I should like to have more time there.  In the afternoon it stopped raining and we walked down the Pass of Aberglaslyn where they say the cliffs rise eight hundred feet from the road.  It is especially fine now as the recent rains have filled the streams very full and the little brooks tumbling over themselves down the mountainsides are very beautiful.<br>   <br>   When we awoke the next morning we were again greeted by the pleasant patter of rainCOMMA but we decided to walk to Beltus-y-coed at any rate.  I am very glad we did as it soon stopped raining and it was a very pretty walk.  At Capel-Curig we again saw the king (we had seen him twice in London) this time in plain every-day clothes in an automobileCOMMA on his way to Carnarvon.  The people had gathered from far and near and greeted him enthusiastically.  I was interested to her them sing the Welsh national anthem in their native languageCOMMA which is certainly most unintelligible.  This morning we returned here and this afternoon visited the Cathedral after which Arthur and I went to see Eaton HallCOMMA the Duke of Westminster's place.  As he is now in London we were allowed to go over his houseCOMMA of course for a shillingCOMMA (everything is for a shilling) and were very much interestedto see how he lives.  It is a most magnificent placeCOMMA ""rich but not gaudy"" and somehow seems much more ""fit"" than some of the summer cottages at NewportCOMMA though I imagineCOMMA as far as money goes that Newport's ""cozy little cottages"" are quite as grand.  Eaton Park is a beautiful stretch of land about three miles (or more) long and the deer grazing in the open fields were very pretty.<br>   <br>   I have now come to the end of my letterCOMMA and as it is growing late I must close.  Please give a great deal of love to Uncle Tom and to Aunt C. and Uncle W and their family and keep a great great deal for yourselves<br>   from your loving grandson<br>   Harold.

I don't know why the time should seem so long but it is even hard to realize that only last Tuesday father and I were looking out over the Bay blue as could be in the sunlight of a splendid September day as we sat on the deck of the ""General"" on our way to Wickford. It seemed a great shame to spend so good a day in that stuffy parlor car.<br>   <br>   We got through the packing very comfortablyCOMMA and (although father did say that in the middle of one night he thought we would never be able to get it all done) with very little worry I think. The only thing now is that none of the freight has yet come. We seem to be getting along very nicely on what we have brought.<br>   <br>   Since my arrival at home I have been to see two of my doctor friends. Dr. Van Pelt and Dr. Bassett the latter fixed me up without doing anything very muchCOMMA a lucky escape for me because I haven't been to the dentist for over a year and Dr. Van Pelt is going to make an examination of my eyes with the aid of drops later on in the year. He goes away tomorrow and thought there would hardly be time to do it now. <br>   <br>    Last sixth day afternoon Father and I took a drive. We went up through the WissahickonCOMMA pretty as usual though the foliage hasn't changed much and then stopped at the Philadelphia Cricket Club grounds where I met Alg. And we had some tennis. Father seems pretty well I think and says he has enough to keep him busy in town for some time so perhaps it is just as well the freight hasn't come yet or he might try to do something at once.<br>    <br>    Yesterday I went up the  Rancocas with HaroldCOMMA George and EstherCOMMA Eleanor Haydock and Anita Downing. I believe Harold thought some of the members of the house party wouldn't be able to go so did not try to get there to-gether this time. In spite of the fact that it was a threatening day and rained just as we reached the ferry and notwithstanding the fact that Harold and I forgot to eat any lunch we had a very nice time and escaped any wetting. It cleared up before we got back and the moonlight was beautiful. Our only accidents wereCOMMA I thinkCOMMA that Esther [---] on the [---] of a very irascible old Irish woman in the trolley car who swore around at a great rate and was not at all mollified by Esther's apology. Then Eleanor dropped her umbrellaafter meeting broke up. John and Mary Emlen were there and altho. they tried to get off pretty quickly thee may be sure a lot of us caught them and detained them for a word or two.<br>   <br>    Alf. is coming to us for supper which will be very nice.

I suppose thee is up at Woodbourne nowCOMMA having a fine time with Frank.  I can just imagine you getting up at some unearthly hour of the morning and kicking up such a rowCOMMA so that nobody else can possibly sleepCOMMA because you have caught a mouse or some other poor little animal in a figure four.  I bet Aunt Carrie was mad when you waked her upCOMMA I remember she always used to be.  Tell Frank I was very much shack[---] to hear of his playing such a wicken trick on Aunt Carrie.  I hope he has been severely lectured for it.  I think he must be getting very wild.  I wish he would write me a letterCOMMA but I suppose he has so many other girls to write to he would hardly have time to spare a few minutes to me.  I suppose thee sees from the top of thisletter that we are in Venice at presentCOMMA and I wish I could change places with thee for a minute or twoCOMMA and let thee see what it is like.  I am not very good at describing thingsCOMMA as I guess thee knows by this timeCOMMA if thee has [wadded?] through many of my stupid lettersCOMMA howeverCOMMA I will do my best.  In the first place it is very beautiful and very different from anything else that I ever sawCOMMA or that anybody ever saw I guess.  The Gondolas are perfectly fascinating.  They are all painted blackCOMMA and are long and narrowCOMMA with pointed ends curled up.  That's graphicCOMMA isn't it?  Never mindCOMMA I am going to draw thee a picture of one.There it is!  Thee sees the man stands at the back and works the boat with one oar.  It is more like paddling than anything elseCOMMA only the man stands up and throws himself forward on  the oar each time.  It is a very graceful motionCOMMA and they do it beautifully feathering the oar each time.  I never saw anything like the way in which they guide the great long boats in and out among each otherCOMMA and around sharp cornersCOMMA without any collissions.  It is really wonderful.  Oh!  Algie!  Thee gave me such a scare about Colin.  I really criedwhen I heard he was lost.  and when I read thy next letter and found it was all rightCOMMA I was too delighted for words.  Why I hardly said good-bye to the old fellowCOMMA and to think of not seeing him again nearly broke my heart.  Wasn't it queer his going off that way.  I hope he wont do it again.  We have gotten some lovely letters since I stopped writing and amoung them  was a paper tellingall about the Tennis TournamentCOMMA which Papa had sent to me.  I enjoyed reading it immenselyCOMMA & got very much excited over the descriptions of the different matchs.  I felt almost as if I was there seeing them.  Some of them must have been fine.  I would love to have seen the one between Hovey and young SearsCOMMA it must have been awfully exciting.  I am sorry poor Huntington was not in it this year.  I am awfully glad he won the doubles anyway.  Campbell must have played beautifully and you must just have held your breaths all through the matchbetween him and Hobart.  From what I gathered it was intensely excitingCOMMA wasn't it?  I can just imagine how sorry you were when Hovey was beaten.  I know how broken hearted I was when Huntington was done up last year.  It must have been something the sameCOMMA at least it says that Hovey gave out entirely in the endCOMMA and evidently was not wellCOMMA and that was just the way with Huntington.  Now AlgieCOMMA I must stop.  I guess thee is sick of hearing me talk about the tournament and will not be very sorry.  Good-night old boy!  Take a great big kiss and hug and all the love thee wants from<br>   Thy veryCOMMA very loving Sister. P.S. Please give my best love to AgnesCOMMA and tell her I am waiting eagerly for a letter from her.  Why don't it come?

I told her when I wrote that I certainly did& that Dr. Stedman was quite willing so I expect I may have a visit from her before long.  She has gone or is going away from home just now on her Mother's account.  You know her Father has just died.  Well to go on with my decorations.

But as  I am expecting to be taken sick to-morrow or next day & may not feel like writing.  I dont think I will do any [---] to begin my letter now.  I think I have told most of the news in my letter home.  Wasn’t it fine about my going in to see the pictures?  I think I will mail thee the catalogueas thee might be interestedCOMMA & it is very prettily gotten up.  I am sorry that the pictures in the catalogue are not the ones I especially enjoyedCOMMA for I should like to have had copies of some of themCOMMA & the pictures in the catalogue are pretty enough to frame-  I mean the finish & all.  The coloring of the Blue Boy & his pose IlikedCOMMA also the coloring of the “Little Girl with Doll” was lovelyCOMMA but I didn’t care much for them.  The Blue Boys [---] was an unusual shade of blueCOMMA bordering on green but soft & not starey & there were lovely shades of old rose in the Little Girl etc.  The ones I marked were the ones I likedCOMMA especially “The Elder SisterCOMMA” & the Romney onesCOMMAa dear little head by Bougereau & perhaps some others I dont just think of.  The little childs head by Gilbert Stuart I was interested in & rather liked.  I hardly saw the modern ones at allCOMMA as we had only about 20 minutes there. <br>   <br>   Wednesday morn. <br>   I am almost sorry I didnt finish this letter up some days ago & send it  even if I could say all I wanted to- for I shant be able to do that nowCOMMA as I want it to go by this morning’s mail-  I have been unwell since I started this- taken just on the dayCOMMA isnt it fine?- I’ve been as regular as can be lately- in fact ever since last Fall sometime.  But I must hurry up &say some at least of the things I want to.  I sent the catalogue of the pictures to thee last MondayCOMMA but dont know whether thee will ever receive itCOMMA as I directed it to Berkley- Thee put BerkleyCOMMA MdCOMMA at the head of thy letter so I thought I’d try it & I put my address on itCOMMA so it will come back to meCOMMA I guessCOMMAif it never reaches thee.  I also sent thee the little [sagne?] & hoods & socks I have been makingCOMMA thinking thee might like to see them.  I hope thy trunk isnt very crowded or they may not be as welcome as I should like.  I directed them to DarlingtonCOMMA I dont believe the little sagne would bebig enough for Edith’s babyCOMMA so dont bother about it.  Thee will probably be a baby some of these days I shall want it forCOMMA & the little hoods may be usefulCOMMA too.  I’m glad to have learned how to make them at any rate. <br>   <br>   It is nearly time for  the post manCOMMA so I’m going to say good-by & write the rest again.  If any one of the boys should want to know something to give me on my birthdayCOMMA I’m very fond of Burne-Jones “Hope” & should like a photo of itCOMMA but remember only if they want to knowsomething.  I must finish in a rush & with a great great deal of loveCOMMA darling from<br>   <br>   Thy little Daughter.     ,http://165.106.6.73:80/cdm/ref/collection/cope/id/3933,3933,2064.cpd

But I must tell you about my birthday first of all. It was such a nice one. I started it by reading thy letterCOMMA deares motherCOMMA which came the night before. I suspected what it was and [---] it and think was the first birthday greeting I got.Then in the morning's mail came thy lovely nightgown case thee made me and dearest. I am so much obliged for it. I have begun to use it at once and think it a much nicer place for my nighty than the closet where used to hang. It came in perfect condition in spite of thy fears! A book from Frank also came in the mail and I had a letter from himCOMMA tooCOMMA later. People have been lovely to me and all the people have been so kind.Miss Richardson gave me a dear little stamp boxCOMMA Miss Barnard (one of the patients) sent me a lovely bunch of violets and another beautiful bunch came for me in the afternoon from Miss Stedman . When I came up from dinner I found a beautiful Easter Lily with Dr. Stedman's card!COMMA & the afternoon mail brought me a bookCOMMA a lovely letter and Easter card from Aunt Anna in the shape of a little book of pressedCalifornia wild flowers. Then just before supper a hugh package was carried up by one of the men and caused a great excitement. It was from Boston and that made it all the more mysterious! On openning it we found a beautiful engraving of Faith Hope & Charity & a letter & an accrostic from Grandpa discolosed the giver- Then in the evening Dr. Stedmancame into the parlor lugging what he pretended was a very heavy box & I recognized Father's handwriting.  He & Dr. Shine opened it for me right there regardless of the dirt the [---] made which was pretty nice of them I thoughtCOMMA & didn't I enjoy getting all your dear things!  The picture is a beautyCOMMA Father dearCOMMA & I am so much obliged for it.  Then the books.

Then The Cardinals Snuff Box- you've heard of it but havent read it & I'm ever so much obliged to thee dear Ern for it- the Boston Experiences- Miss Webb & I looked at the pictures at once & I think we may read it out loud.  The pictures are awfully cute &I imagine it's amusing.  Thank theeCOMMA dear old SquidCOMMA a great many times.<br>   <br>   But even this was not the endCOMMA for Dr. Shine informed me that two boxes had gone up to my room & when I went up to bed I found some beautiful flowers from Father & a box of violets from Aunt Carrie-  I dont hardly know how to thank Father for besides the lovely flowers on my birthdayCOMMA when I came home from church on Easter I found a lovely lily waiting for me in my room from himCOMMA so that my fireplace now has an Easter lily on each side of it.  Thank theeCOMMA dear DaddyCOMMA so much.  Thee gives thy little daughter much too much.

I hope to write to him myselfCOMMA but dont know just how soon I shall accomplish it & I'd likehim to know at once how much I appreciated both the picture & the poem.  Then dear Grandma too.  I had a letter from her & I think maybe a book I received without any card is from her.  It is a daisy & is called the Oxford Book of English Verse- If you can find out whether she send it please thank her ever so much & tell her I am delightedwith it.  Please give them both my love.  And will you give Aunt Carrie my love & thank her so much for the lovely violets.  I think it was so dear of her to send them.  I may get a letter written to her myself some of these days.

The weather was pretty warm but when we got on the boat we had a nice breeze-  The Drew maintains her old expectation for speedCOMMA and running at the rate of eighteen or twenty miles an hour soon brought us to Rhinebeck which is opposite of Rondout-  We got our dinner on the boatCOMMA and were seated at a table with a party of Irish people who amused us very much.  As soon as seated they ordered of one of the waiters ""three plates of roast beef"" which they continued to order of the various waiters as they passed.  The waiter of our table having gone out after our dinner of course none of the others paid any attention so them and they waited for some timeCOMMA whereupon they began to talk in a very funny way-  When our waiter came they asked him how soon they were going to get their dinner.  He said they had not ordered yet whereupon they waxed quite pathetic and said they could not tell who they ordered it of but they had ordered of three or four and they all looked just alike- when we left they were comforting themselves with roast beef but were grumbling that they were missing all the beautiful scenery-  When wereached Rhinebeck we found the boat ""The Lark"" (peculiar name is it not for a boat but we thought in our case rather [---] for this occasion as we felt inclined for going on ""a Lark"") waiting and were soon landed at Rondout-  Here we had to walk about a square to the depotCOMMA depot did I sayCOMMA noCOMMA I dont mean thatCOMMA but to the street corner from which the cars start-  Thee would have been amused to see the manner of conducting the railroad-  The told us the cars started from that corner and the train would be ready in a few minutes-  Some time after the time for starting we saw the engine coming from down toward a wharf and were not a little surprised to see a horse car coming towards us from the opposite direction upon the same track.  It occurred to us we would just as leave be where we were as in either- but when they got close to=gether they stopped and did not attempt pass upon the same trackChellie asked out Conductor if they used the same track promiscously and he relieved our minds by saying ""no""-  After we left Kingston the car was pretty full and some of the people were real characters.  The front seat in our car was occupied by a real old fashioned farmer and his wife .  Presently a man came though the car and stopped and spoke to him very hard and then it seemed all of sudden to dawn upon him who he was and he hollared ? out ""How'd you do my hearty"" and pulled him down on to the seat with his wife and himself-  The poor little woman was almost crished and the whole thing was very amusing in the realityCOMMA more so I am afriad than I have made it seem.  Afterward the two men went to another seat and the farmer sat with his arm around the other mans neck in a most affectionate manner-  As Chellieis writing home very fully and as [---] is rather scarceCOMMA I am afraid I shall [repent?] so well bid thee farewell-  Please give my love to father and mother Lilly and my two little sisters and with a large share for thyself I am thy attached bro<br>   JE.

With their long legs (only one of which they stand upon at a time) their necks which they draw well down between their hunched up shouldersCOMMA their grave or rather I may say melancholy expression gives them a ridiculous appearance and when they gyrate or give a great jump as they sometimes do with no apparent object it was perfectly [inesistable]-  The monkey house also proved a place of no small amusement-  as we visited it about 11 o'clock I suppose it was the hour for the old monkies to be taking their morning naps however that may be a number of them were asleep-  One old ape amused us very much he was taking a nap upon one of the bars and apparently the last idea that had entered his head beforefalling asleep was that it would be desirable to scratch his head so he would raise his arm until his hand nearly reached his head and then down it would dropCOMMA this he repeated over and over again-  In another cage there were three asleep upon one of the roosts with their arms around each other0  In other cages there were the usual pranks and absurdities going on which monkies indulge in. <br>   <br>   The keeper of the laughing hyenas was very obliging and gave us the opportunity of hearing ""the very remarkable noise"" which the song informs us the animal makes every fifteen minutes""- <br>   <br>   In the snake house every thing seemed to be in a very quiet state most of the snakes being coiled up  under their blankets-  One or two of the Boa Constrictors were tied up in sundry knots and laid out on the tree to sun-  We saw quite as much of them as we care to snakes not being our favorites-  We next visited the Hippopotomi and Rhinoceros.  The former are the most ungainly looking animals I ever saw.  There is a little one only eight months old and altho' so young its body so much longer than an ox.  The keeper brought some grass to feed them and made them open their mouths-  But I will stop for I am afraid I have said too much already about animals-  I think thee would be very amused at some of the servants we see here the absurd way they are dressed-  Not unfrequently5<br>   we see footmen with drab coats with brass buttonsCOMMA crimson breechesCOMMA white stockingsCOMMA low shoes and with either white wigs or powdered hair-<br>     <br>   The other day I saw an old fashioned coach by an old fashioned coach I mean one driven in the style of olden time four horses with a guard who had a long horn which he was blowing as they drove through the streets.  I believe it is owned and driven by a young lord who having plenty of money and a fancy for that sort of thing amuses himself in this way-  He has men to attend to all the money matters and to the passengers while he just drives-  Yesterdat we went out to the Crystal Palace and spent most of the day there-  It is a wonderful place so much to see-  It is something like our Sanitary Fair wasCOMMA if thee remembers thatCOMMA only on a larger scale.  We went around until we were very tired and then we dined.  After dinner we continued out investigations visiting amongst other things the ""[---] animals""- These are large creatures made to represent what they suppose some of the extinct species were like-  They are placed about among the trees and on the edge of one of the lakes in natural positions but it struck us there was a good deal of humbling about it-  One sixth day evening last TomCOMMA RuebenCOMMA & I went to Parliament-  We couldnot get seats for Chellie and H as they told us they were often engaged a week ahead in the ladies gallery-  We had rather an amusing experience-  We reached the hall about five minutes of nine and were told we would have to wait for a few minutes as the  House was just being made up.  We were seated with a number of others upon benches in the Hall and after waiting for sometime the first was told it might go in and then the second-  We passed up a long flight of stairs and went into a little toom where our tickets (which Tom had purchased from a man in the afternoon) were examined we were in a bitter trepidation while this was going on as we did not know whether they were good for anything or notCOMMA however they passed us- As soon as weentered the gallery the janitor came to us and pointed us to seats into which we sank he then told us we must park our hats under the seatsCOMMA then he turned to another man and told him he must not raise up to seeCOMMA then he made another man put his umbrella upon the seat behind him not allowing him to hold it in his hand so if he had ordered us to pull off our shoes I should not have been surprised- We heard three or four speeches upon the Army bill and were very much amused-  Every once in a while the speakers would get rather muddled and there would come a succession of aws and grunts and hesitations which was absurd-  And then there were occasional mysterious sounds which at9<br>   last we discovered was applause in the shape of hear! hear!-  How they made such sounds I dont know it was a kind of mingled mumble and rattle it put me in mind of the child that swallowed the bead necklace-  We stayed until nearly half past eleven and then concluded we had got nearly two shillings worth and would go. <br>   <br>   This morning we went to Westminster meeting and were not a little surprised upon going into see Chas & Anna Sharples and their daughter-  After meeting we had quite a talk with them and learn that they are going to sail on the second of next mo:-  They have visited Vienna Switzerland France &c [---] trip ideed-  We also met Wm Bradford (the Artist) who is spending the summer in London) he was very kind and invited us to come to his studio-  Bevan Braithwaite was at meeting and pressed us to come and see him when we return a very warm hearted Friend.  We expect to leave tomorrow for the north-  Tell mother we are all pretty well-  Please give a great deal of love to father and mother and each one of brothers & sisters.  Tell them none must feel slighted when letters are not addressed to them individually for all our letters are intended for all.  Please give love to them at Uncle Johns & Toms also at School Lane.

We do so enjoy having Tom with us and he seems to be not only enjoying himself but improving--when he first joined us at London he looked very badly not having recovered from the sea voyage I suppose he was very pale and thinCOMMA but has been gaining pretty steadily so that now his cheeks have quite a color and he looks fuller in the face than I ever remember to have see him--I do not think his leg troubles him muchCOMMA as he says it does not hurt himCOMMA and he walks about a good deal--we shall try to keep him from doing too much--<br>   <br>   I think Chellie seems stronger than when we left homeCOMMA as she is certainly able to walk more and does not get as fatigued as she would at home--<br>   <br>   She has gained some flesh but is not what you would call stout yet. For a day or two her throat has been a little swelledCOMMA but I shall get her some [tannin?] or a gargle and I think that will relieve her. I have written [---] particularly in regard to health as I know thee would like to know. The weather except a few days in London has been cool so that we have generally not been able to wear our [thin?] clothes. Chellie has not found her waterproof dress to wear for traveling and now that we are going north shawls are called into acquisition. Evening 9.05. I wish thee could look in upon us this evening and see how snugly we are fixedCOMMA seated around a centre table in our cosey little parlor with four candles burning upon on the table and at this point Tom came in and proposed we should take a row upon the lake in the moonlight and as it was a lovely evening we went and now have just returned--I did wish for some of the girls form Awbury for it was so perfectly beautiful that even the [staid manied?] people almost grew sentimental--The lake was just rippled by the gentle wind and the moon was hanging over the western mountains throwing a silvered path across the waterCOMMA and on the shores we could dimly see the outlines of Wray Castle and the pretty residences with which the shores are studdedCOMMA and in which the lights were brightly shining. The rain which continued most of the day stopped toward evening and although the roads were rather muddy we started out for exercise and had a pleasant walk of three miles toward Bowness. [---] tt has cleared we expect to start early tomorrowmorning for Keswick. As this letter is for thy information on little points in travels I will tell thee of our general hours. We find it suits us best not to dine later than three or half past and so whether we take our dinner at the hold or elsewhere try to have it at that hour. We breakfast generally at half past eight and then take tea at half past seven or eight and spend our evening in our sitting room either writing home or in journals or in talking over the scenes of the day and planning for the morrow. In traveling we generally manage to have a car to ourselves and Reuben looks after the baggage and Tom eitherkeeps him or assists Chellie and HCOMMA while I am buying our tickets-  We get along very nicely indeed-  In the last letters thee said that some of them at home thought ""thee was writing too much""COMMA I hope thee will not stay thy hand on that accountCOMMA but only as thy strength will warrantCOMMA for I can assure thee every detail of home news is very interesting-  We think of you very very often and I hope the time may come when thee will enjoy the beauties which we are visitingCOMMA but altho the present is so full of enjoyment the future (when we shall return to your midst) looks very pleasant.<br>   <br>   The little books dear motherCOMMA which thee gave us just before leaving are our constant compantions in our travels and it is pleasant to think as we read them morning and evening that thee too has them and altho the time may be different yet we read them the same day-  I enclose a little bunch of wild flowers which I picked while visiting Swarthmore part of them I gathered at the meeting house and part from the HallCOMMA I wish they were better preserved but they were pressed under difficulties in my pocketbook and I had to arrange them for pressing as we walked.  I send them thinking thee might like a little memento of Swarthmore-  I am afraid this will prove a scrappy letter and rather uninteresting for it is madeup of little nothings-  Hannah desires her love to thee and the rest of the Awbury family-  When thee sees them at School Lane please give them my love also a great deal to all at home and at Uncle Toms and Uncle John'sCOMMA Chellie has retired or would join me in these messages-  With much love I am thy loving son<br>   J.Evans.<br>   P.S.  I dont know if any mention has been made of how Reuben is and as his father and mother were rather anxious about him when we leftCOMMA will thee tell them that I think he is much betterCOMMA but would improve faster if he took more rest especially in writing his letters and journal as he often sets up late and is up early-  ",http://165.106.6.73:80/cdm/ref/collection/cope/id/4047,4047,2178.cpd

We have had a very warm day the thermometer standing at 83 [degrees] a good deal of the time and there has been very little air stirring-  This morning MaryCOMMA Alexis AlfCOMMA John Hazen and Henry made an excursion to the top of Kate's Mountain.  They had an early breakfast and got off about 8 oclock and did not get back until nearly one.  They had a pretty rough scramble and some how did not get to the right place and so missed the view-  I was glad they went as they thought it paid and I am afraid they find it rather monotonous-  The life is a very lazy one and while it is so warm in the middle of the day there is very little to be done in the way of excercizeCOMMA with any comfort-  I think Alf seems better and the water suits him but Hazen is not able to drink the sulphur water and does not seemed to have impreoved as much as I hoped he would-  I do not mean that he is sick but he still looks pale.  He seems bright and much less nervous than when he left home and I hope he will improve more after his return-  Lily has bathed twice (yesterday and today) having her bath at about 100 [degrees] and says she thinks it suited her for after lying down she felt refreshed and better-  but of course it is too soon for there to be much change-  She stayed in the first day only about 2 minutes and today 5 so thee sees she is feeling her way.<br>   <br>   This afternoon Lily and Alexis took a drive-  I have been disappointed 3<br>   in the air here it is not bracing at all-  and as the mountains are all around us often we get but little breeze-<br>   <br>   The daily routine of our life here is not thrilling-  We rise about half past seven and it is often half past eight before we get assembled at the breakfast table-  After breakfast (which we rarely get through until quarter past nine) we walk around the grounds for a little while visiting the springCOMMA Japanese StoreCOMMA Post Office &c and then spend the time until 11 o'ck (when we bathe) either in readingCOMMA writing or talking-.  After the bath we put in the time as best we may until dinner time 2 O'clk.  After dinner we set out under the trees upon the lawn or upon our piazza and read aloud or talk until tea time and after tea we generally take a walk and then sit in the parlor until bedtime ""and thus our days go onCOMMA go on""  The boys vary it occasionally by a little walk upon their own account or by going swimming or sometimes we roll a game of ten pins-  I have gone very much into details and I have no doubt father and Tom will laugh at the letter and groan over such a life (so do I) but I thought these little nothings would interest thee and moreover there is very little else to tell-  Our movements in the future are very uncertain and as yet we cannot say when we shall home or whether some will remain- as soon as some conclusion is arrived at we will let you know.

We were counting the days until the time when thee was to sail and beginning to speculate upon the probable length of the passageCOMMA when suddenly all our hopes were dashed-  I was going to say I would not flatter thee by telling thee what lamentations there were on the part of some of usCOMMA but I think it does no one harm to know how much they are loved and missed at homeCOMMA on the contrary I think  to a young man it does goodCOMMA tending perhaps to keep him out of some things by which he might otherwise be tempted-  Now for the scrape of news I can glean up-  Last fourth day Tom and I drove over to Haverford to bring away thy [chattels?]-  We arranged to go on third dayCOMMA but on that day we had a regular old fashioned Nor'easter and it poured most of the day-  The next morning about nine oclock Tommy appeared at our house in the [---] with Lady and Eric (Harry having been laid up some time with sore feet) after getting some more warm wraps for it had cleared off quite cold when we started-  The roads were in a pretty miserable state of muddiness and as we undertook to go by the Lancaster road we almost stuck so to speak-  However we reached the College about half past elevenCOMMA and finding the students in recitation we went up stairs and explored-  We found all thy things had been moved out of thy room and were locked up in another closet of which the matron hadkey so she had to be hunted up-  We packed most of the books and some other things in a drawer which Tommy and I carried down to the front door Tommy saying it was ""like carrying down a little coffin""-  We donated to Frank Haines a bottle of eye washCOMMA a little bottle of carbolic acid and a few other valuables?-  Thus were the last rites performed-  We packed the books in the bottom of the wagonCOMMA and put the precious articlesCOMMA around with we supposed tender associations ( clung COMMA (a broken fan with names thereon &c) between folds of the down cover-  We drove home to dinner reaching Awbury about quarter of four-  We had a good laugh at Tom - one of the objects over was to bring home the hanging book shelf and we forgot all about itCOMMA and came home without it - which rankled in Tommy's breast-  By the way talking of Haverford does thee know they have raised a sufficient amount of money to enable them to buildCOMMA and Samuel Alsop Jr told me it was decided to go ahead-  The day we werethere was the day before Thanksgiving dayCOMMA and as I waited upstairs in the entry while Tom was hunting up the Matron I was amused at two of the studentsCOMMA one was in the hall down stairs and as the other came out I suppose from recitation - he announced the fact that they were going to have Turkey for dinnerCOMMA whereupon there went up such a howl of rejoicing as almost upset me-  We hoped while at Haverford to have had time to have called upon Margaret YarnallCOMMA but we spent to much time at Any Marys that we had not time.  I suppose you have heard that Ellis and M Yarnall are boarding at [---] during the Winter.  I am glad to hear they are vert comfortably fixed-  It seems an out of the way kind of place for themCOMMA a good deal away from most of the latter's friendsCOMMA I should think she would long to have her daughter with her.  I do feel for them very much-  First day 12/5.  A weekCOMMA my dear AfredCOMMA has passed since I commenced this letter yet it is not finished.5<br>   During the week we have been pained from day to day to hear of Uncle Alfred's increasing illness.  As early as the beginning of the week Dr Wister said he seemed to be failingCOMMA and on second day they telegraphed for JamesCOMMA they received an answer the next morning only saying ""will come"" and that is all they have heard.  Up to second day Uncle Alfred has been able to get over into the libraryCOMMA this he has accomplished with the aid of a man who has been staying with him at night for a number of weeks- assisting him to dress and undress.  One second day he was so much weaker that he had to remain in bed- and since then he has been gradually growing weaker and weakerCOMMA until yesterday afternoon about three o'clock he quietly passed away-  He does not seem to have had any acute disease-  His appetite almost entirely gave outCOMMA and he gradually weakened - with the exception of a pain in one of his lungs I do not think he has suffered any-  Since last first day Uncle Tom and John E Carter have been sitting up with him half of alternate nightsCOMMA the nurse sitting up the other half.  Lilly and Edward have been staying over at Fairfield for the last day or two-  Yesterday morning having heard how he was the evening before FatherCOMMA Uncle Tom and Aunt Lizzie went over thereCOMMA the Doctor came soon after they arrived and said he did not think he could live but a few minutes.  They went up into his room (except Father who had gone on to town) and sat there for two hours awaiting the close- he seemed entirely conscious but lay perfectly still excepting once when he passed his hand through his hair as his custom was and once he put his hand under his head-  They went to dinner and a few minutes after dinner was over he passed awayCOMMA no one but Aunt RebeccaCOMMA Lily and Edward being present.  Just at the closeCOMMA there was a short spasm and then to him all was joy and peace and rest-  What a wonderful and glorious change it must be for him after a long life of ill health and suffering during which I suppose he could never have said he really felt wellCOMMA to awake inthat Holy City none of whose inhabitants can say I sick and where ""there shall be no more deathCOMMA neither sorrow nor cryingCOMMA neither shall there be ay more pain: for the former things are passed away""-  Aunt Caroline seems to feel it very muchCOMMA not having seen for some time except a few days agoCOMMA when hearing how sick he was she went out to see himCOMMA but ut was thought best for her not to go in the room or let him see her so she looked at him through the door-  The only remarks I have heard that Uncle Alfred made (though he probably said more which I have not heard) were that some days ago he told J.E.C. ""that it made very little difference which way it ended"" meaning his sickness-  To E. Allen who visited home within a few daysCOMMA and as she was leaving said she supposed she should never see him on earth again and that she did not doubt but that the change would be a glorious one to him he replied ""I have been forced to feel very quiet and peaceful""  I think those were the words he used-  The funeral is to be next third day at two oclock.  It will be a great trial I doubt not to James to find all over when hearrives - <br>   <br>   Last sixth day Uncle Tom commenced his winter readings and it was said to have been a very interesting occasion-  Neither Chellie nor I was able to get there-  There is a good deal of stir in our City now over the meetings of Moody & Sankey-  They have fitted up the old freight depot of the Pennsylvania RR so that it will seat about eleven thousand and meetings are being held I think twice on week days and three times on first days - they are largely attended and from accounts some of them must be impressive.  I hope they may do good-<br>   <br>   I suppose Mother in her weekly letter told you that Hazen had sprained his ancleCOMMA turned it under him as he was rushing out of the side door to catch the train-  Tommy seems to think it was a mercy he sprained it as it will probably save him from something worse if he will only take warning.  He had to hold it up for nearly a week.  However he is about again now tho he says it feels weak.  Aunt Lizzie Brown is still down at Atlantic City where she has been for some 9<br>   weeks and from accounts does not seem much better.  Aunt Fanny went down last third day taking with her a maid to stay with aunt Lizzie-  I am afraid her sickness is a pretty serious one and not to be gotten over in a hurry.  The rest of them at Grandfathers are pretty well now-  Grandfather has had a cold but is better-  Aunt Martha Leeds I suppose you have heard is at the Frankford AsylumCOMMA and from last accounts was not much better in her mind and was also very sick with [---] in her head-  I dont know whether thee has heard or not that the new building at Haverford is to go up next year they having got enough subscribed to warrant them in commencing so Samuel Alsop Jr told me.<br>   <br>   Lillies letter from [---] arrived on sixth day last and we were very glad to hear of your being so comfortably and pleasantly fixed-  Please give a great deal of love to both Lilly and Alexis and tell them I often think of them both with much affection and truly it does seem a long long time since we parted with them.  I do hope the stay will do you all a great deal of good-  I am afraid you have missed some of our letters Chell and I both misunderstood and have been directing our letters to Brown-Shipley & Co Liverpool - and I am afraid they have not forwarded them-  I wrote not long ago a letter to thee and one to Lilly and Alexis enclosing a photograph of the baby to each-  If they have never come to hand I will send you another-  Harry has at last made up his mind to return to Minneapolis - he expects to start next fourth day.  I hope he will have a more prosperous time the coming year than he has had the last-  Upon looking over the forepart of this letter which I wrote a week ago I find I have mentioned about the building at Haverford in that so thee will please excuse my telling it again-  I dont feel like rewriting the letter-  Chell sends her love to you all in which I join and wish you ""a merry Christmas"" and ""a happy New Year""-  I remain thy<br>   loving brother<br>   J Evans    ",http://165.106.6.73:80/cdm/ref/collection/cope/id/4086,4086,2217.cpd

Since you went away I have been very lonely and not having anyone to play with have been with Kate and Lizzie most the time - Last first day week in the afternoon Lizzie went out and as there was no one about at home I thought I would go too she told me to ""go home"" a great many times but I wanted to go so I wouldn't mind her but followed on - I wish I had minded her for I had a great deal of trouble - She went over to Germantown and went into a great big house I think I heard them call it a church I tried to go in with her but there was a man at the door and he would not let me in so I played around on the street for a while and then I got tired and another little dog came along and asked me to take a walk so we ran off together - After a while it began to get dark and I watned to go home but I found I did not know the way I asked the little dog with me but he said he never heard of Awbury and didn't know anything about it. He said he must go home and get his supper and go to bed or his mother would give him a whipping. I went on and on up one street and down another until at last I came to the railroad. I remembered the railroad ran by Awbury so I thought if I followed along that I would gethome. So I ran along as fast as I could until I came to the bridge over Haines St then I had to go slow. I want to tell you one thing never try to cross over a railroad bridge- just as I got over it I heard a noise and looked over my shoulder and there was a train coming I [hurried?] all I could. It kept getting nearer and nearer and I was awfully scared and the next thing I knew something struck me and I was knocked off the bridge and fell down into the street-  My foot and my tail hurt me dreadfully and I felt sore all over and I could not move and I just laid and cried and cried - after a little while a man came and picked me up and carried me into the little house right by the railroad - He was a funny looking manhe was almost black. I hear them say I was pretty badly hurt and I thought so too for I had pain all over me. I heard them say I had two of my toes cut off and part of my tail. They put a rag on my foot and tied up my tail and put me on the floor in the corner of the room and there I laid for more than a week so sore and stiff I could not move. Some little children came to look at me but they were black too and did not look like you then there was a little baby about as big as Edward and they put him in a kind of a boat and used it to rock him up and down. I had never seen anything of the kind before I thought it was very strange. I don't believe the baby like it for it used to cry a great deal and it used to make myhead ache to see the boat go up and down but maybe that was because I was sick. I think I heard them call the boat a cradle. The room where I was was not very nice and it smelt bad and was not clean. At first I was very bad and could not sleep or eat but just lay and moaned all the time and then the things they had to eat were not nice. As a I lay there I thought a great deal of the good times I had playing with you and wondered if I should ever get home and see you again - after I had been there about a week I began to feel better they would not let me go out. I used to hear the carriages go by but I could not run out and bark at them the way I did at Awbury. One day I hearda carriage coming and it stopped at the house where I was. I listened and thought I heard papa's voice and in a minute or two the door opened and he came into the room he could not see me for it was pretty dark and I was down behind the boat. Papa told the woman he wanted to see the little dog that they had found hurt so she brought me out and there was Grandpa too. They called me Buster and I was so glad to see them I did not know what to do. I jumped about all I could but I was still pretty stiff and my foot hurt me. They picked me up and too me out to the carriage and there was Uncle Tom and Alexis. Grandpa gave the woman a green piece of paper I heard them call itmoney and grandpa told the woman it was for the trouble she had had with me. I wasn't any trouble at all and I don't know what she could want with a little piece of green paper. Then we drove home and they were all so glad to see me. Aunt CarrieCOMMA nannyCOMMA Katy and Lizzie all made a great fuss over me and oh! I was glad to get home. I wish you were here. They gave me some supper and I heard them talking about me. They said I was very dirty I don't know how I got so for I have been in the house almost all the time and didn't go in a ditch once. They say they are going to give me a bath tomorrow (I wish they wouldn't for I hate baths) and they say I will soon be wellthey think. And then when you come home wont we have jolly times playing together. I think I can run just as fast as ever even if two of my toes are gone. Well now I must stop for I am tired and can't write any more. They say Scott has got the mange or something that sounds like that. I haven't seen him yet but suspect he will be down in the morning to see me. I send you my picture herewith that you may see how I look now. Do you think I am changed much?

Since you went away I have been very lonely and not having anyone to play with have been with Kate and Lizzie most the time - Last first day week in the afternoon Lizzie went out and as there was no one about at home I thought I would go too she told me to ""go home"" a great many times but I wanted to go so I wouldn't mind her but followed on - I wish I had minded her for I had a great deal of trouble - She went over to Germantown and went into a great big house I think I heard them call it a church I tried to go in with her but there was a man at the door and he would not let me in so I played around on the street for a while and then I got tired and another little dog came along and asked me to take a walk so we ran off together - After a while it began to get dark and I watned to go home but I found I did not know the way I asked the little dog with me but he said he never heard of Awbury and didn't know anything about it. He said he must go home and get his supper and go to bed or his mother would give him a whipping. I went on and on up one street and down another until at last I came to the railroad. I remembered the railroad ran by Awbury so I thought if I followed along that I would gethome. So I ran along as fast as I could until I came to the bridge over Haines St then I had to go slow. I want to tell you one thing never try to cross over a railroad bridge- just as I got over it I heard a noise and looked over my shoulder and there was a train coming I [hurried?] all I could. It kept getting nearer and nearer and I was awfully scared and the next thing I knew something struck me and I was knocked off the bridge and fell down into the street-  My foot and my tail hurt me dreadfully and I felt sore all over and I could not move and I just laid and cried and cried - after a little while a man came and picked me up and carried me into the little house right by the railroad - He was a funny looking manhe was almost black. I hear them say I was pretty badly hurt and I thought so too for I had pain all over me. I heard them say I had two of my toes cut off and part of my tail. They put a rag on my foot and tied up my tail and put me on the floor in the corner of the room and there I laid for more than a week so sore and stiff I could not move.

Altho I sent thee a postal from NY this AM for I am going to post a few lines the afternoon. I reached Philada about half past one and found the weather very different from Newport. The thermo. hanging by my side as I write standing at between 85° and 86° and the air somehow feels lifeless. I came away in such a hurry at the last that I forgot several things. Tell Hazen we need not have hurried if we had know for I waited nearly an hour before the boat arrived. I carried of the Post office key which I enclose herewith. I think sister Ann has my pocket knife which I lent her yesterday morning and either Algie or Edward has my [rule?]. These last I do not need and you can keep them until I come on or until some one is coming this way. I forgot to tell thee that I wish that bucket of solution of [copperas?] poured down the kitchen sink and then lit John put about two double handfuls more of it into a bucket of water and let it stand for about a week and then pour that down and put about a pailful down any week. I wish thee would call and see Truman Pickham some evening as you come home from a ride and ask him about the well and the drains I went to see him but he was not at home and he is at work except after six in the evening or between 12 and 1 at noon. I had not time to call again. If the cow you have does not prove satisfactory get Hazen to see what Ward will rent his cow for he did not tell me definitely and if he would take 4.00 per week I would take her if this one does not prove satisfactory.I do hope my dearest thee will take things easy. I am afraid the care will be so much that thee will not gain much and please do remember that it is my special wish that thee shall either have extra help or have the washing done out or anything that will [unnerve?] thee. I wish I could be on hand to help and relieve this. I do hope you are all well and are getting on comfortably. If I was only sure that the well and the drains were all rightCOMMA I should feel much more happy. I hope they are and have done all I know how. I fully intended to have brought on two of those [Appolinans?] bottles full of the well water for Reuben Haines to have examined. I wish theewould send them on by the first opportunity. Please give my love to the two Annas and Hazen and with lots for the dear children and thy own dear self. I shall try not to worry about you but leave you in the care of our loving Heavenly Father who I feel has been and is very good to us and to whom we should give our love and thanks.

I feel quite anxious to hear how you are but suppose I shall hear nothing now until I see Tom--I had indulged a vain hope that somehow I might spend the fourth with you but there is so much to do at the office that I could not leave just at that time but I am hoping I can get off so as to come on the latter part of the weekCOMMA but don't count on it too certainly but I will if I anyhow can.

I enclose a letter I received from Kate this morning it came enclosed in one to Madgie. I do hope you are getting along comfortably and are all well--give my love to the family. I paid John's wife the $25 yesterday. Thee can tell him that they were all well.Mother had a postal yesterday from aunt E.

I am ashamed to say that I have not been over to call upon the Newhalls yet but from reports they are very much pleased with the place. There mother seems stronger and sleeps better. I am afraid dearest my letters are very stupid- writing every day there is not much chance for a collection of news but then thee knows each one contains any quantity of love and sympathy and dearestI feel that we are growing nearer and dearer to each other all the time and it is such a comfort.

Dear little boy I am very glad to hear he is better and it was very thoughtful and kind of thee dearest to telegraph. We are going along very nicely at home. Tom and Alf and I had dinner at 7 o'clock last night and it was very nice. We had fricasseed chickenCOMMA potato peas and [beets?] and then raspberries for dessert and tea was on the side board and we each took a cup at the close of the meal.

I was very much surprised to hear of the death of Hannah Newhall. She is to be burried to morrow at 2 o'clock from our house.  I was tired last evening and so did not go over to call until this morning I found Abby and Mary in a very resigned? and very cheerful state. They said they did not regret at all having moved out and were glad of it. They said they were afraid we would not like to have the funeral from our house and hoped there mothers death then would not cast a gloom over the house for us-  I assure them that it would not in the least and that I was very glad they were going to have the funeral from there-  Abby said the great heat of last week seemed to prostrate their mother and she gradually sank away until third day morning she quietly ceased to breathe without struggle-  Ally said she was leaning over her at the time doing something and her bother had her hand closed upon a handkerchief and she said she noticed her hand gently relaxed and ther handkerchief dropped this was all that markedthe change.  William Newhall was there and he told me he was so glad his sisters had such a place to stay in and Abby and Mary both seems so glad they were when they were and not at a boarding house or hotel.  They said it had seemed like home to them from the very first day they move out.  I sent them some flowers on my way to meeting.  They want me to be on hand at the time of the funeral to do some things for them so I shall go out in the 12 M train.<br>   <br>   We had a good meeting this morning Cousin James and Samuel Morris spoke-  Cousin James came to me after meeting and said they were so much obliged for our kindness to Anna &c-  I am better dearest the pain in my back is almost entirely gone and my [---] is less.

Everything is moving along very serenely so far as I know.  It is fun to see Tommy studying [---] and Paramous book at the breakfast table getting up a menu winding up by saying ""Well!

Hazen and Anna expect to go over to Cousin C Hartshorne to tea this evening.  We are getting along very nicely dearest and thee need not feel the least concerned about.  I am really very comfortable and as to health am much better I have a good appetite in fact I expect I eat too much for my dyspepsia - which however is better - And now dearest I want to tell thee that I am sorry I said what I did at Newport-  I know my natural tendency is when everything goes along smoothly to settle down build castles in thr air and enjoy this world and I have no doubt that I need to be [---] more and more from this world and that our loving and merciful Heavenly Father breaks up my rest and [---] this world's pleasures that I may look beyond and have my heart fixed on Heaven and Heavenly things -  Our Heavenly Father does not willingly affect and if it only has the effect intended it will be but one of the light affliction which last but for a moment-  Therefore my dearest pray that I may grow better and better - I reallylong that such may be the case but the flesh is very weak.  I feel as our dear children are growing up I should be a better example to them -  So dearest do not worry about me but try and get well and strong-  I think of thee very very often with the tenderest love and pray that we may grow together in best things which I know will make us happen and happen in each other and in out Children.

I am very glad to hear you are all well that is the family and am sorry the maids are not so. What seems to be the matter? And does Dr. Cleveland think either the sickness or the children arose from the Water? I am very sorry dearest thee has had so much trouble about the water and it seems to me a keg will not be large enough for daily wants for drinking and cooking and as it is a very very large one and if not it seems to me it would be better either to get Stephen Barker to hand a hand daily or to make an arrangement to hire his wagon and harness early every morning and for John to go for it. I hired the wagon and harness to go into Newport for 50c and he would probably make a much cheaper price for everyday arrangement. The water at the new reservoir is to be filtered through eight feet of sand and unless this arrangement is completed I should doubt whether the water would be any good. I wish dearest that I was there to help thee. What seems to be the trouble with the maids [---] get along amiably together? I [---] remember me to each of the [---] I hope they are enjoying the summer and trying to do all they can to help thee out in my absence. When thee gets a little more time won't thee write me a little more fully about your health. Whether thee and the children have good appetites and whether thee think the children have gained any thus far. We are all well at home. I had a sick headache last night and returned early but am over it now. Anna and Hazen are going over to Cousin Chas Hartshorne to tea and the [---] to stay all night. I am glad thee had madearrangement for [---] for although I cannot believe the [---] my bad yet I have been constantly anxious about you. Please give me love to mother and Aunt Mary and Kate and party. <br>   <br>   I have sent the $45.00 by Uncle Henry who is going to leave tomorrow morning by Rail and you must meet him. I do hope darling thee finds time to rest and does not get so any time please write me fully how the is and whether the gets very tired. and don't forget to answer any questions. I am very much [---] that the girls should give thee any extra trouble. I wish I could do something for thee. I stayed out to meeting this morning and am  writing in a great hurry.<br>   With dear love I am thy most loving husband. <br>   JEvans- ,http://165.106.6.73:80/cdm/ref/collection/cope/id/4228,4228,2359.cpd

How thankful I am that it turned out no worse. I have often feel anxious about your driving about but never thought of such an accident. Hope thee will have the [] fixed as the braces cannot slip off again and do be careful. I sent this yesterday by mail dearest a book which I thought would interest thee. It may be too large to go in the box at the Post office so thee had better inquire for it. I inclose herewith a letter from Sallie Simpson which I took the liberty of opening althought  I feel rather mean for so doing his thought thee would not mind much. I am very sorry to hear such sad news from Smith Hamson. As to Gip I think thee has done quite right. I think he is a ""bad egg"" and will never amount to much. And is not worth bothering with although if he turns up I think I shall bring him home and sell him. I am glad you seem to be having a good time and hope you are all well although thee fails to report in that particular. Is thee going to take Algie again to see Dr. Cleveland? I hope thee will be careful in regard to the children's bathing in the sea for I do not think it suits either of them very well. I enclose a little slip on bathing. Please give my love to Uncle H and Aunt M and tell them I hope they will pay a longer visit and stay over into next week.

I sent thee a hasty note by George and also sent a basket of peaches which I thought it a shame to trouble him with but after all the promises of sending one to thee somehow. And now dear I wish to thank thee for the sleeve button studs and Collar button they very pretty and thee knows from the way I size upon thy buttons I need some of my own. I believe or rather know that I have on at this minute a pair I gave thee. It is quite warm this evening a real August night warm-sticky  And sultry. Reuben brought me this afternoon the analysis of the water and I am very much at a loss what to say. Thee had better show it Dr Cleveland and see what he says it seems to me that if the water was boiled and filtered for drinking and cooking there could be no possible dangerCOMMA but ask him. Dear me I am very sorry there has been so much bother about the water. I do hope you keep will and that you may be found to do so until your return which does not seem say far distant now. Alf and Maggie I believe send on word by George about their prospects. I hope Anna will be able to go on with them for she does not seem very well and Newport seems to suit her. Now dearest I want to say a word or two to thee about thyselfPlease do take can of thyself and take all the rest thee can. I wish thee had less to do or that I could give thee more help.<br>   First day morning. Well dear we are promised another warm August day. Fog early this morning and the thermometer now stands at near 80. I am glad you are out of it. We are all pretty well this morning I have nearly regarded my usual standard and with a little further can in my diet think I shall be all right. I am very sorry dear but I never remember the money thee asked for to be sent on by George. I will try and remember to send it on by Alf. I hope thee can borrow of mother or George so as not to Be entirely poverty stricken. My dear wife I feel drawn very near and close to thee in love and most ardently do I desire for myself that I may grow in grace and that we may be more and more united as a family and grow together in good things. I feel for myself that I am not near as good as I should be and I often feel quite discouraged. There are so many enormous within oneself to be drawn out.

I am quite well again only a little cold hanging around manifesting itself by a little huskiness in my voice nothing to speak of and I should not do so now only I promised to write fully.  I will forward thy letter to Mary F Brown as soon as I learn the address.  Yesterday I attended the funeral.  I went out home at 1:15 and we had dinner at 2 oclock and I drove father over.  he went to Cousin F Yarnalls to tea and I drove home-  Hazen drove over to Cousin F's and brought father home-  They funeral was very large- but I did not see one of Susie's relatives there but myself-  The services were conducted by Reverend Watson assisted by Dr Coil and F Yarnall and one or two other ministers were in attendance-  There was no sermon-  The hymn sung was ""Asleep in Jesus""-  After the funeral I spoke to Cousin Elizabeth and Wistar and sent a message of love and sympathy to Susie-  As you may not have heard the details of the death I will tell you as we have learned them.  The cause of death was a blood clot upon the brain.  the Dr also found one on the lungs-  They (Chas [Wheeler?] and Charlie) were rather late for the train and were running to catch it just as they got to the Washington Markets Charlie who was a little ahead of his father looked back to see where he was and saw him stagger and then fall he was unconscious and was carried into the Market house-  A doctor was immediately sent for but Chas Wheeler died just as the Dr arrived.  he lived about 15 minutes after he fell.  The body was then carried to the Station House little Charlie going with it.  He had to remain with it until 7 oclock in the evening and attend the inquest and undergo an examination answering many what would seem to us knowing the circumstances [---]questions such as whether his father was drunk and whether he was a drinking man &c &c-  What a terrible ordeal for a boy 14 years old.  At the funeral yesterday he looked very badly like an old man.  Susie arrived about 7 oclock in New York and Charlie then joined her and they came on- when they arrived at Bryn Mawr through some mistake they were not met and Susie and the four Children had to walk home about a mile and a half at between 11 and 12 oclock at night.<br>   <br>   I believe Susie expects to return today to Newport.<br>   <br>   I am rejoiced dear to hear of your welfare.  The weather yesterday was very oppressive-  It was the most trying day we have had this summer.  Today is warm the thermometer standing at about 85 at a little after 10 ock yet the air is not so steamy- and by the paper I see there is a prospect of cooler weather-<br>   <br>   Please give my love to mother and I am sorry to hear she is not well hope nothing much amiss.  Give my love to the children and with a heartful for thy own dear self I am thy loving<br>   husband<br>   J Evans ",http://165.106.6.73:80/cdm/ref/collection/cope/id/4284,4284,2415.cpd
